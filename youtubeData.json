   "transcription": "there are big companies being hit by SQL\u00a0injections all the time still in 2016 and if you\u00a0\u00a0mess it up then all your usernames and passwords\u00a0are out there in Pohnpei spin or what have you\u00a0\u00a0and it's it's it's bad PR not to mention illegal\u00a0you know data protection acts and so on and it's\u00a0\u00a0yes bad news for everyone involved and inevitably\u00a0bad news for the hacker as well who probably goes\u00a0\u00a0to jail okay so I should just preface this by\u00a0saying that you know if you do this you will go\u00a0\u00a0to jail so really don't you know I'm doing it on\u00a0my own website which is allowed because I've given\u00a0\u00a0myself permission I sometimes go back and watch\u00a0older computer file videos because you know maybe\u00a0\u00a0I came to computer for a bit later because I know\u00a0maybe I was busy doing something I don't but the\u00a0\u00a0reason is so I go back and I look at these videos\u00a0and the home scott did a reinserting video on SQL\u00a0\u00a0injections which is exactly right okay so I'm\u00a0not going to remit the wheel by talking about\u00a0\u00a0exactly how they work but what I thought is I\u00a0do some and perhaps demonstrate to anyone who's\u00a0\u00a0got an interest in web development just how bad\u00a0it is if you mess this up this little potential\u00a0\u00a0I can social product anyone who actually does\u00a0web development or any kind of design will see\u00a0\u00a0immediately this is this is bad okay we've got\u00a0a lovely little blue gradient here and a just\u00a0\u00a0a box okay so I can search for hammer and when\u00a0I do that I get a couple of hammers up so I get\u00a0\u00a0a claw hammer in a sledge hammer right and I can\u00a0search for other things nails is it I don't know\u00a0\u00a0a common what I'm selling in this hardware shop\u00a0yeah okay so different kinds of nails all right\u00a0\u00a0these are all the nails I know it exists right\u00a0different different arbitrary links of nail I\u00a0\u00a0assume they it's elbows anyway all right this is\u00a0not a shot that you would actually want to put\u00a0\u00a0your credit card details in this shop also apart\u00a0from being bad as a shop is also bad as a web\u00a0\u00a0program because it's PHP and I haven't escaped\u00a0strings like I should have done when I type in\u00a0\u00a0hammer and click submit a post request goes off\u00a0PHP receives this and constructs an SQL query but\u00a0\u00a0says you know give me any roads that have hammer\u00a0in and then asks the database for all those rows\u00a0\u00a0and then spit some out on the screen problem\u00a0arises is if we put in a special SQL command\u00a0\u00a0character in this text box then the string but\u00a0PHP forms is going to be malformed in some way\u00a0\u00a0it's not going to make any sense as a query any\u00a0more or it's going to make sense as two queries or\u00a0\u00a0so on and bad news for everyone involved the first\u00a0thing we do is we work out whether this text box\u00a0\u00a0is vulnerable at all okay so if you put a single\u00a0quote in right and we press submit and it says\u00a0\u00a0server error we apologize for the inconvenience\u00a0okay what's very nice of them but this is that\u00a0\u00a0bad news right we're in a proper server would\u00a0say there is no product with name single quote\u00a0\u00a0because there isn't or it will return any products\u00a0like by O'Reilly you know hammers you know that\u00a0\u00a0have an actual single quoting it should have used\u00a0that single quote as a character not as a control\u00a0\u00a0structure so what can we do to attack this well\u00a0the first thing we need to do is think a little\u00a0\u00a0bit about what the query might be behind the scene\u00a0so we can we can adjust it so I've got my my text\u00a0\u00a0editor here and I'm going through I'm gonna type\u00a0in a query so I'm thinking that the query is going\u00a0\u00a0to be something on the lines of select something\u00a0right some question mark from some table I don't\u00a0\u00a0know what the name of it is it could be product\u00a0or prod or you know IDs I don't read it could be\u00a0\u00a0anything from some table where some column is like\u00a0hammer if I search for amme which is the middle\u00a0\u00a0characters of hammer I also see that it finds\u00a0the hammer which means that is putting wildcards\u00a0\u00a0in either side so that's what my query is select\u00a0something from some table where something is like\u00a0\u00a0hammer I have control over this bit this hammer\u00a0word I can't change the rest of a query because\u00a0\u00a0that's back-end PHP code that's already been\u00a0coded so where are you typing this now this is\u00a0\u00a0just a text editor I'm just doing this so my own\u00a0head I can visualize the query right you wouldn't\u00a0\u00a0necessarily have to do this if you were super\u00a0good at this right but it helps and also it's\u00a0\u00a0obviously illustrative to people who are watching\u00a0also this does SQL markup syntax highlighting so I\u00a0\u00a0can show you how the query changes as I change\u00a0it so this is my generic query right how do I\u00a0\u00a0edit it well what happens if I if I just put in\u00a0a single quote so I'm going to copy this line if\u00a0\u00a0I put in a single quote instead of Hamor that's\u00a0what happens now you can see those few percents\u00a0\u00a0of different colors and the reason is because\u00a0what's happened is this first percent is inside\u00a0\u00a0a proper string and now the second percent sitting\u00a0on its own outside of any SQL string and that's\u00a0\u00a0going to cause a server error so that's just that\u00a0texture just to shown you by the color coding that\u00a0\u00a0yeah this is showing me pretty much what would be\u00a0going on in PHP when I type single quote into that\u00a0\u00a0into that box which is that basically breaks SQL\u00a0because it sends a malformed query okay that's not\u00a0\u00a0a valid query the server will respond the database\u00a0will respondent with an error and PHP will say\u00a0\u00a0server sorry for the inconvenience so the question\u00a0then becomes what do I change this single quote\u00a0\u00a0into to really get information out of this and\u00a0the first thing that's important to do is find out\u00a0\u00a0what database management system is running this\u00a0on the server so imagine that SQL is a language\u00a0\u00a0that's shared by a bunch of different database\u00a0management systems so SQL Server MySQL Postgres\u00a0\u00a0and so on so forth they will all have very\u00a0similar syntax slightly different but very similar\u00a0\u00a0certainly select will be the same and the point\u00a0is that if I know which one it is I can then start\u00a0\u00a0targeting that one directly and for example find\u00a0that where there lists of table names are finding\u00a0\u00a0the listed table names obviously quite helpful for\u00a0me to get rid of some of these question marks and\u00a0\u00a0fill in some blanks first of all I can get rid of\u00a0the rest of this malformed query by putting in a\u00a0\u00a0end of command and the comment okay and you'll see\u00a0in this intact if it's gone gray which tells me\u00a0\u00a0but now this is the query that I'm typing in so\u00a0if my input to this shop is single quote then a\u00a0\u00a0semicolon and a comment then what should happen\u00a0is it should change to this query here which is\u00a0\u00a0select something from the table where wildcard\u00a0which means everything so I should get all of the\u00a0\u00a0products in the database which I do ok so this\u00a0is all the product it's not very good shop the\u00a0\u00a0two dozen I don't know okay no one wants these\u00a0products north buy my things right so so that's\u00a0\u00a0a start now what do we put in as well to try and\u00a0break this so the first thing we can do is we can\u00a0\u00a0put in something that will only work if MySQL is\u00a0the database management system now I could also do\u00a0\u00a0an equivalent for Mokpo stress or equivalent for\u00a0SQL Server I happen to know secretly but this is\u00a0\u00a0my SQL but you could automate this pretty quickly\u00a0so what I'm going to say is select something from\u00a0\u00a0something from where something like this thing\u00a0okay and I'm going to put in hammer because I\u00a0\u00a0only want to return the two items okay well that\u00a0would make sense in a minute we're hammer and one\u00a0\u00a0equals sleep too so what I'm saying there is find\u00a0any products that are called hammer and also where\u00a0\u00a0the function sleep to sleep for two seconds wait\u00a0for two seconds returns a one so that should still\u00a0\u00a0turn to hammers but it should take four seconds to\u00a0do so because there's two hammers alright that's\u00a0\u00a0my hypothesis let's see if it works so I'm going\u00a0to copy exactly from hammer all the way to the\u00a0\u00a0end of my quote there and I'm going to paste that\u00a0in and we're going to see and it's thinking it's\u00a0\u00a0thinking and it's taken four seconds it's not\u00a0found any products which probably means sleep\u00a0\u00a0return of zero not one so there's my bad right\u00a0it doesn't really matter the point is it weighted\u00a0\u00a0exactly four seconds and then returned us either\u00a0some products or not some products so that was\u00a0\u00a0basically you just trying to command just to see\u00a0if it did what you asked it yeah so it inside this\u00a0\u00a0query I've buried the request for the server to\u00a0sleep for two seconds there's two hammers which\u00a0\u00a0basically means to every row but it finds it's\u00a0also going to wait two seconds which is two okay\u00a0\u00a0four seconds now MySQL has a sleep function in it\u00a0cattle eight asleep brackets the number of seconds\u00a0\u00a0you want to sleep for its wait for delay in SQL\u00a0Server so I would adjust this slightly and I try\u00a0\u00a0again so if it didn't sleep I think I probably\u00a0not SQL MySQL maybe I'll try the equivalent for\u00a0\u00a0Postgres or try be equivalent there are what we\u00a0call blind SQL injections where even if we're\u00a0\u00a0not getting any output we can base it on just a\u00a0time it takes to respond work out what's going on\u00a0\u00a0you could do another thing where you said select\u00a0from a certain table name and also sleep and if it\u00a0\u00a0comes back slowly you know at the table with that\u00a0name okay so you can even if there's no output use\u00a0\u00a0this blind technique to work out what's going on\u00a0okay it's going to take you a little while to do\u00a0\u00a0right in my case I happen to get it the first time\u00a0yay okay so good news right so now what can we do\u00a0\u00a0so let's start with my hammer thing again so I'm\u00a0going to take this I'm going to copy it okay next\u00a0\u00a0up we're going to use the fact that we know it's\u00a0MySQL to try and find some more information on\u00a0\u00a0what tables exists and so on this isn't a blind\u00a0SQL injection because if I search a hammer it\u00a0\u00a0produces me a table so it's actually outputting\u00a0to the screen now this is very common a shop you\u00a0\u00a0search for product it's got to take that table\u00a0information and turn it into an HTML format for\u00a0\u00a0you to look at okay so even if it doesn't look\u00a0like an actual table like on my bad website it\u00a0\u00a0is in a sense that if taken table data have turned\u00a0into some form so it will event also downloaded a\u00a0\u00a0picture of the product you know some reviews I'll\u00a0get rid of this bit this sleep and I say what can\u00a0\u00a0I do that sticks information I'd like to extract\u00a0from database on the end of this product so what I\u00a0\u00a0really want to do is turn this table into a table\u00a0that dumps out you know passwords or something\u00a0\u00a0like that if such things exist in this database\u00a0now in SQL we use the Union keyword to do this\u00a0\u00a0okay so Union basically takes two tables with the\u00a0same amount of columns and sticks and one on top\u00a0\u00a0of the other so if I can find a way of sticking\u00a0some personal private database information on\u00a0\u00a0the bottom of the camera list then it's going to\u00a0output it to the screen so select something from\u00a0\u00a0some table now all we know about this miss select\u00a0is what it's selecting three columns okay because\u00a0\u00a0it's three columns output at least that's what\u00a0I'm hypothesizing so select three columns from\u00a0\u00a0some table where some column name is like hammer\u00a0okay so what I'm going to do instead is I'm going\u00a0\u00a0to say like hammer Union sub query select one two\u00a0three from jewel now for those of you don't know\u00a0\u00a0my spiel particularly jewel is essentially\u00a0a placeholder table name to select from if\u00a0\u00a0you don't really have a table to select for okay\u00a0it's use for testing purposes mostly okay so I'm\u00a0\u00a0literally selecting the numbers 1 2 & 3 in three\u00a0columns from some hypothetical jewel table right\u00a0\u00a0now if this works what it will do is stick one\u00a0two three on a row or the bottom of my hammers\u00a0\u00a0if it works okay so let's see so take my hammer\u00a0I copy all the way to the end there we go and I\u00a0\u00a0go into my website and I search and there's my one\u00a0two three okay that's bad news for the event with\u00a0\u00a0this website which coincidentally is me okay so\u00a0the fact that I can output queries to the screen\u00a0\u00a0is really bad it's not just bad it's catastrophic\u00a0okay because we're only a few steps away from\u00a0\u00a0full-on users and passwords so let's do it so\u00a0yeah not to be too cavalier about the security\u00a0\u00a0right so let's not select one two and free from\u00a0jewel because maybe that's not very informative\u00a0\u00a0okay let's select from MySQL information schema so\u00a0there's a table in the information schema called\u00a0\u00a0funnily enough information T its key m\u00e9doc tables\u00a0and that will tell us all the table information\u00a0\u00a0names of tables what columns they have and so\u00a0on it's the table of tables takes the table\u00a0\u00a0tables right let's Union select table name table\u00a0schema which is the database name and then a three\u00a0\u00a0because we need to make sure the number of columns\u00a0match up between our Union table and the original\u00a0\u00a0hammer table does it just put it underneath it\u00a0literally just pay put it underneath yet if you\u00a0\u00a0want to merge columns it sort of it row by row\u00a0that's a join and if you're just sticking on\u00a0\u00a0top of us that's an appending that's a Union just\u00a0just two different terms for sq up so select table\u00a0\u00a0name table scheme work three from information\u00a0schema dot tables notice it's got purple which\u00a0\u00a0is a good sign because it means that this syntax\u00a0highlighting recognizes I vouch typed in an SQL\u00a0\u00a0come on so let's copy this the slow way with my\u00a0fingers there we go and paste that in there there\u00a0\u00a0we go so the information schema is essentially a\u00a0metadata table but holds information on all the\u00a0\u00a0columns and tables and number of rows and things\u00a0for all the tables you would query if you want to\u00a0\u00a0know what columns exist and what tables exist I've\u00a0got a claw hammer and I've got a sledgehammer I've\u00a0\u00a0got a funny blog table called evil and a funny\u00a0blog table called posts which we may talk about\u00a0\u00a0in a different video right I haven't bothered\u00a0to put them in different databases that's with\u00a0\u00a0honet right then we have a bunch of kind of almost\u00a0semi random tables this is MySQL stuff we scroll\u00a0\u00a0down and then right at the bottom we've got the\u00a0shop tables and we've got a table called stock\u00a0\u00a0and a table called users so we won't select\u00a0anything from stock because I doesn't seems\u00a0\u00a0very interesting particular as we can search\u00a0for anyway but we use this table on your hand\u00a0\u00a0might seem quite useful to us okay we don't know\u00a0what's in there but we've got to assume some kind\u00a0\u00a0of user data now if we go back to my SQL query we\u00a0know what the table is what we don't know is what\u00a0\u00a0the columns are in the table and if we want to put\u00a0some output from that users table on the bottom of\u00a0\u00a0our table we're going to need to know what the\u00a0column names are cuz otherwise we can't select\u00a0\u00a0them we can't just say select everything because\u00a0they'll probably be more than three columns and\u00a0\u00a0that won't union properly so we're going to\u00a0say select something like hammer Union select\u00a0\u00a0column name two three from information schema I'm\u00a0off screen now let's keep scrolling info schema\u00a0\u00a0dot-coms where table name so the information\u00a0schema doc columns table unsurprisingly has\u00a0\u00a0column information also has what table that\u00a0column belongs to my table name equals users\u00a0\u00a0okay well I thought about that there we go okay\u00a0that looks good to me so let's copy that let's\u00a0\u00a0see if it works there we go okay so what we've got\u00a0is we've got our hammers again alright we're going\u00a0\u00a0to keep seeing them and then we've got a couple of\u00a0standard MySQL things like current connections how\u00a0\u00a0many people are logged in and then we've got some\u00a0actual column names user ID user login user hash\u00a0\u00a0user type now anyone that knows anything about\u00a0hashing passwords and so on nut can guess that the\u00a0\u00a0ID is probably just for not a number representing\u00a0that user probably just stuck in the table by\u00a0\u00a0default the login is going to be their login name\u00a0and hash is going to be a hashed version of their\u00a0\u00a0password okay now most database cracks don't get\u00a0unencrypted passwords people are slowly at least\u00a0\u00a0wiring up a little bit to hashing although they\u00a0don't tend to hash them particularly securely so\u00a0\u00a0this is this is certainly a candidate for crack\u00a0path of cracking for example so let's get those\u00a0\u00a0things out so we need three columns from the users\u00a0table and we want all of it right so we want let's\u00a0\u00a0say user login user hash and user type so let's\u00a0get rid of this select here we go and we've owner\u00a0\u00a0so we're still unioning that's I don't know if\u00a0that's an actual verb we're still performing a\u00a0\u00a0union Select you name is it you name or is it you\u00a0login you login okay so you you login you hash\u00a0\u00a0you type from users and that's all three columns\u00a0append it to the previous one any so we'll copy\u00a0\u00a0that and see if it works and it does so we've\u00a0got a bunch of users they're hashed passwords\u00a0\u00a0and we also see but because of a type this guy's\u00a0an admin okay so I would focus on his password\u00a0\u00a0personally right so that's pretty scary okay it\u00a0didn't take me very many queries to get through\u00a0\u00a0this now before everyone goes off and cracks these\u00a0passwords right what you're welcome to do if you\u00a0\u00a0want but bear in mind this is a website that only\u00a0runs on my computer and these are probably just\u00a0\u00a0the word password or something like that because\u00a0I wasn't being particularly careful when I created\u00a0\u00a0this database these aren't real people whose\u00a0password you're cracking here so don't waste\u00a0\u00a0your time I advise it's scary how easy that how\u00a0easy that was to do now Tom talks a lot about how\u00a0\u00a0you stop this kind of stuff from happening okay\u00a0parameterize queries sanitizing an input so but\u00a0\u00a0I can't put single quotes in without them being\u00a0escaped okay those sort of things are important\u00a0\u00a0but you have to also think about things like\u00a0second order SQL injections which is where I put\u00a0\u00a0something into an SQL Server and then it gets used\u00a0internally as a query so for example I make my\u00a0\u00a0username a SQL injection right and it gets escaped\u00a0properly but it gets stored in the database and\u00a0\u00a0then when I go to change my password the injection\u00a0gets run okay so that's a second-order injection\u00a0\u00a0so there's loads of complicated stuff you can\u00a0do that could get around some of these things\u00a0\u00a0so if you're a web developer you have to pay\u00a0a lot of attention to this because you don't\u00a0\u00a0want your users hashed passwords and email\u00a0address combinations stuck on the net because\u00a0\u00a0it's embarrassing and illegal and really bad news\u00a0for your customers I mean case in point talk talk\u00a0\u00a0got hacked a few months ago and that was hacked by\u00a0essentially a script a Python script that performs\u00a0\u00a0what I just did but in bulk really really quickly\u00a0it takes I've run it it takes about on my website\u00a0\u00a0free commands to obtain what I just obtained and\u00a0dump them to a file which is pretty terrifying\u00a0\u00a0you know so I would suggest people start\u00a0scientists analyzing their inputs pretty quickis that if I obtain a cookie of you\u00a0which is supposed to be secure then\u00a0\u00a0I can send that to let's say Amazon or\u00a0to a shop and say I'm Sean please you\u00a0\u00a0know what's in the shopping basket what's\u00a0his address what's his credit card details",

   "transcription": "Everyone's passwords are terribleand they should change their passwords right now.Well, let's just get that right out in the openOkay, you all have bad passwordsand you know you should feel bad.Probably not necessarily people who watch Computerphile,but the majority of the public don't have good passwords and it's a real problem.It's a problem becausepeople like LinkedIn and TalkTalk get hacked anda bunch of hashed passwords go out onto the internetand then within\u2014you know\u2014hourshalf of them have been crackedand then people are going \"Oh this username and this password's been crackedWell let's just go on and log on over there and see if thatusername and password combination gets me into their AmazonOh it does that's good news!\" And so on.Password cracking has massive implications for password security.For what passwords you need to use, how to store your passwords and so on and so forth.In a previous video Tom Scott talked about how to store passwordsTom Scott:\"Please please please look up a recent tutorial for the languge you're using\"As a company, right, these things are still true, rightThe hashing algorithms, that you have to use have become longerbecause they don't hold up as well, the older ones, which we will see in a minuteAnd, uhmso some things have changed but really the principal remains the same, rightWe don't store passwords unencrypted in a database because that's a terrible terrible idea.What we do is we pass them through something we call a one way pseudorandom functionWhich basically takes some plain text password and turns it into gibberishAnd then when somone tries to log in we do the same operation on what they've just typedand if the gibberish matches up we know they've typed in their passwords correctlywithout actually having to know what their password is.But if these hashes get dumped on the internetwe can't reverse them because they're just random nonsensebut what we can do is test a load of different wordsby hashing them and seeing if the hashes match any of the ones in the dictionaryand if they do we know we've cracked their passwordand that's really really easy to doI'm gonna show you it, and it scared me the first timeSo yeah, let's see I've changed all my passwords since then put it that wayOkay, now this is... well, is an SSH terminalBut this is \"Beast\", right, the app we named \"Beast\"which is our Deep Learning, one of our Deep Learning services",

   "title": "The Problem with Time & Timezones - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "30 Dec 2013",
   "transcription": "Sooner or later, every programmer has to deal with time zones.And I can't really offer much advice here; I can offer a cautionary tale.I can tell you why you really should never, ever deal with time zones if you can help it.Let's imagine that someone has built an applicationthat lets you calculate how many seconds something is in the past.You type in a date and a time, it gives you the number of seconds.And they look at that and think \"OK, that kind of works for me...\"\"But let's add a little box that lets you change the time zone\"So if you're comparing between now in New York and five days ago in London, you can work that out.And that's fine - the little drop down lets you change which hour forward or backward of Greenwich you are.Brilliant.Sooner or later, after it gets a bit popular, they'll get a call from Australia.And Australia will say \"G'day ma--\"-- I'm not gonna try and do accents.I just shouldn't do accents.Australia will say \"Hello!\"\"By the way, we're 9\u00bd hours ahead of Greenwich.\"And the programmer will go \"really?\"\"Yeah, 9\u00bd hours.\"\"OK, I'll add a special case for you. That's fine.\"A little bit later, someone will call from Nepal.And they'll say \"Hello. We're 5\u00bc hours ahead of Greenwich.\"And they'll say \"really?\"\"Yeah we've been that for ages! Yeah 5\u00bc hours!\"Great. Okay. And they'll put in a special case.And maybe they'll look upthe list of time zones. The Canonical list that tells youwhat everything is, and they'll make sure they've covered every time zone in the world.And then Autumn will come along.And they'll get a call from England.And England will say \"Excuse me. Um, we're an hour out at the minute, what's going on?\"\"Hold on the clock's just changed!\"\"That's fine - no, we dealt with that.\"\"We made a note of when daylight savings changes for us, and we've put that in!\"And England will say \"No, see daylight savings changes a week earlier for us.\"\"It's different depending on where you live.\"\"We shift our clocks back a week before you do.\"And at that pointgenerally the programmer will start to hold their head in their handsand realise what they've gotten themselves into.And that's fine! They'll put that inand they will deal with each country shifting to daylight savings time on a different day.They'll look at the file that tells them how to do that and they'll copy all that in.Then they'll get a call from someone in the southern hemisphere again who will say\"Yeah we're not shifting back in the Autumn we shift forward.\"\"Our spring... is in November.\"At that point they'll generally start looking longingly at their intoxicant of choiceand wondering whether they should have a quick drink before keeping going......and they'll code that in as well.Then they'll get a call from Samoa.Out in the Pacific on the international date line.And Samoa will say \"Hello!\"\"Yeah we skipped a day the other year.\"And the programmer will say \"what?\"\"Yeah we skipped a day. We went from December 29th, 2011 to December 31st.\"\"We shifted from one side of the international date line from being hours and hours behind Greenwich ...... to being hours and hours ahead of Greenwich. Helps us with trading with Australia.\"\"Can you take account of that when you work out how many days things are, and how many seconds things are in the past?\"[breathing deeply]That's fine, there's a file that tells you when any country has changed its time zone.It turns out that that happens fairly often.But they're announced ahead of schedule so as long as you keep that file updatedand code that into your program's logic as well, it'll be fine.Then you look back and you notice that during World War II,England had double British Summer Time.It went completely onto BST and then just added an extra hour.So it was two hours ahead of Greenwich despite... having Greenwich.That's fine you deal with that.Have you noticed I've started talking as if it was you or me?Because I've done this before and it's really, really frustrating.And you make sure you subscribe to the listof when countries are going to change their time zones - which happens, apparently, many times!Like, sometimes, several times in a year because governments change over.And then this mythical programmer gets a call from Libya;who in 2013, with only a couple of days' notice, decided that they weren't going to put the clocks back.With enough notice that it wasn't possible for anyone to get the update out in time.Meaning that every Libyan computer, no matter what operating system it ran...... was an hour out.That's OK, you read the news article about that and you hurriedly code that in as well.And then, then you get a call from the West Bank.Where the Israeli population is on a different time zone to the Palestinian population.Because one is following Israel and one isn't.Now you have two populations of people in the same location who are following different time zones.And now they're all having to ask themselves whether they're on this time zone or this one, depending on who they are and where they areAnd there's no way to code that into your program! And then...Then you get a call from the historian.Who says \"Right, I'm trying to calculate some times back in the 18th century.\"\"And we changed from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar.\"\"It's not that we lost about three weeks ...... it's just that we skipped right from this date to this date, and missed the others.\"\"Can you code it so that it just kind of works that out for me?\"It's fine because someone has already told you when those dates are,and you can code that into your program's logic as wellbut now it's looking really, long and really complicatedand it's a tangled mess of spaghetti code that somehow worksand then you get a call from the Russian historian!Who says \"Yeah, we only changed to the Gregorian calendar in the 20th century ...... and it turns out the dates you've skipped change depending on your location ...... and can you deal with that as well?\"And then you get a call from the British historian!Who says that until, I think it was the 16th century ...the year started on the 25th of March!Just to blow your mind there.From 24th of March, 924and then it would be 25th of March, 925. And that is the next day.Because you have gone from December 31st, 924, to January 1st, 924 because it goes in that order!It's massively complicated, AND THEN...You get the call from the astrophysicist...Who says \"By the way, we just had a leap second!\"And at this point, you just kind of go \"... what?!\"Leap seconds; because the Earth does not rotate at a constant speed.It slows down, it speeds up, as tectonic plates move aboutand magnetic fields shift, or something like that, and so occasionallythe International Astronomical Union will work out whether we need a leap second.If you do, the clocks go 23:59:58and then it's 23:59:59and then instead of going [00:00:00] like any sensible time zone wouldit goes 23:59:60!And everything breaks because suddenly you have 61 seconds in a minute!So depending on your implementation, either ...... your clock gets one second out of sync with the rest of the worldor it repeats a second.The way you're meant to deal with this is with something called the Unix Timestamp.And Numberphile, I think, has talked about this before.That you have this number that started on the first exact second of 1970and increments one second, per second.Constantly. Tick. Tick. Tick.And that's great because what you're meant to do is take whatever date has been given to you,and you calculate that as a Unix Timestamp,and you put that into your database.And that'll just deal with leap secondsEXCEPT IT DOESN'T! Of course it doesn't!Because you have Universal Coordinated Timewhich includes leap seconds!It repeats occasionally, and it just includes 23:59:60and then you have astronomical time! Which does not include leap secondsand has steadily been getting out of sync with the rest of the worldbecause we need to look at the stars and design telescopes around it![deep sigh]And what you learn...What you learn after dealing with time zones, is that what you do ...... is you put away your code ...... you don't try and write anything to deal with this.You look at the people who have been there before you.You look at the first people, the people who have dealt with this before,the people who have built the spaghetti code,and you thank them very much for making it open source,and you give them credit, and you take what they have made and you put it in your program,and you never ever look at it again.Because that way lies madness.Google actually has a really, really good approach to leap seconds that they invented themselves.There's an article about it on their blog, I think, that explains it.They do something called a \"leap smear.\"Because having 61 seconds in a minute,or because having a clock tick back a second,can be really, really bad for massive agencies that have tosynchronise everything really precisely and have to trust that one bit of data was stored before another,they essentially smear the second out over the whole day.They increase their clock by a microsecond at a time.Tick tick tick, all the way through the day.So that it's, sometimes maybe even half a second out from reality,but as long as everything on their servers is half a second out.It's built to be out of sync with the world, as long as it knows that one thing happened before another.Having continuity is more important than actually having accurate time.",

   "transcription": "The title of this, ur, video should be, c...can we have this. The title of this video should be \"How not to store passwords\"um...uh, thank you, umbecause, y...you really shouldn't store passwords yourselfif you can at all avoid itif you are running any kind of web serviceand you are storing passwordsit is so incredibly easy to get it wrongur, that basically you shouldn't tryif you can use sign-in with facebook or twitter or googleand get them to handle it for youfor crying out loud please doif you're web programmersooner or later, you're gonna have to store passwordsand this is the ways not to do itif you wanna know the ways to do it i will kinda say that at the endbut please please please look up a recent tutorial for the language you're using.um, by the time you watch this video,the advice will have changedyou may be watching this years in the futurelook up a tutorial that has been written the last few months by someone reputable and follow that.how do you not store passwords.the first instinct, the naive thing :is just store the users passwordsso let's say you have a signup box, and you have a username and password boxthe naive thing is when a user signs up,you take their password and store it in the database as it is in plain text.that has a couple of advantages:first of all if they forget their password, you could just email it to them.and it means that checking it is really simple:when they log in again, you take the username, you take that password,and then you check what they just typedyou compare it to what it's in the databaseand if it matches, you let them inand that is the naive approach to storing passwordsand there are still professional websites, out there, run by big corporationsthat still use this strategyand you can tell that they're using this strategybecause they email your password back to you in plain text when you ask for itum, this is a monumentally bad ideathis is an astonishingly bad idea because if someone gets into your databasethrough a security hole, or because they're an insider with accessand let's be honest if you're storing passwords this wayyou probably have other security holes toothen, they can just read out every user, and their passwordsso you have their email address, and you have their passwordsand let's be honest, most people reuse the same password for their email address on websitesso this is a bad idea, because it's incredibly insecureapproach number 2slightly less naive, still a bad ideais you take that password,and you encrypt it,so you hide it behind somethingand encryption is two wayso encryption is so you have a keythat will lock something, and then unlock it againso the naive approach is you take the user's passwordyou take it into your database, encrypt it like this behind the other thing you've lockedand then, when they log in againyou take what they've got, you go here, you unlock thisyou compare them, and then you let them in!now that's a little bit more secure,because if someone just reads out the database you've got an encryption key therebut it's got a couple of big flawsfirst of all, as soon as that key is availablethe password is still visible and can still be read outand it means that an insider, or even a hacker in some casescan just take the encryption key as well with themand they've still got access to all the passwordsthat's a pretty bad ideathe other flaw with this is that if you have lots of people using the same passwordand if you've got a big site this will happenbecause lots of people will use 123456 or password1and if I've just said either of your youtube passwords, go change itif you have that all the encryption will be the sameso, even if you don't have the encryption key,you can still tell that all these people have the same password, so it's probably a common oneAdobe just made this mistake this month, as we record thisAdobe, the big companybehind Acrobat, which makes PDFsbehind Photoshop, behind all the big toolsmillions and millions and millions of userstheir password database got breachedgigabytes of passwords lostbut it's fine..yours ? yes mine were as wellfortunately i didn't use that password anywhere else, which is what you should hopefully be doingtheir passwords were encryptedand, that was it, it was just a lock on itand it meant that everyone who had the same passwordhad the same encrypted codeunfortunately they'd also stored all the password hints with themwhich is wonderfulbecause then you can look, oh look, there's 20 people who've used the same password hereand that one says Michael Jackson is the password hintand that one says Halloweenand that one says \"type of movie\" oh look it's \"thriller'OK, wonderful it's \"thriller'and that's  one of the biggest software companies in the world didn't do this properlyanyway, so , don't use encryptionnaive attempt number 3:hashingnow i talked about this in an earlier videoa hash is a summary of a load of dataso let's say you have the password the user entersand you know that, when they enter it, you're gonna hash it.you're gonna put it through some kind of convolutionsthat ends up like thatand then, when the users enters their password againmutate in the same way, compare, they're the samewhich is great in theory,but unfortunately you open the same problem that Adobe hadwhich is that if you can tell a common password, if it's in loads of people's database entriesyou probably can work out what it isworse than that, as i've said beforeGoogle has an index of these thingsif you're using a basic hashing algorithmyou can pretty much just type the code into Google and it will give you the password backas well as just  searching for common hashes on Googlethere are these things called \"rainbow tables\"which trade off computation time for hard drive spaceso rather than having to calculate millions and milions of hashes,for this one password, someone has already done it for youcalculated hashes for billions of common passwordsand just put them out in a databaseit's gigabytes long, but it's a lot easier to search through thatthan it is to try and do a load of calculationsso if you're using something common like MD5 or SHA1 with nothing else addedthe rainbow table will pretty much help you crack that in a few secondsi have in the past used all those naive approaches myself on things i built in my youthi've gone back and fixed them where they're still aliveand just sort of quietly buried code where they weren'tbut the approach nowadays is to use something called hashing and saltingas i said the best thing is not to store passwords at all but if you have tothe advice these days is hash; saltso a salt is a random string of charactersthat is different for every single userit's a password you know, in your database, you can store it in plain text, it doesn't matterthe user could even know it, not it would help them with anythingthat meanswhen the user registers, they put their password inand it goes into the same algorithm but as well as thatyou generate a random string of characters for each usercompletely random, a new second password if you likethat goes in the databaseand that gets fed into this algorithm tooso that comes in, mutates it a bit more, comes out with something elseso if another user uses the same passwordthat algorithm will get a completely different saltfrom themsome people might base it on the username that's generally a bad thing to doit should just be a random string of charactersso the same password going in from a different user will mutate into something entirely differentthe point of thisis that now you just have a random string for each useryou cannot possibly pull the password back from thisit wont appear in Googlebecause it's a massively long random stringyou can't brute force it backby looking at what common passwords are reusedall you can dois do the old style attackof trying every single common password one after the otherand if your salt is long enoughand your hashing algorithm is complicated enoughthen that's really incredibly difficult to dodo it right, and it's lifetime of the universe difficult to door at least it is, until they use the password 123456",

   "title": "Why Electronic Voting is a BAD Idea - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "18 Dec 2014",
   "transcription": "E-voting is a terrible ideaAfter Hurricane Sandy in 2012, election officialsin some parts of America decided that they'dallow emergency e-voting from home. You'ddownload a ballot paper, you'd fill it out,and then you would email or fax it back tothem. And yes, some people still fax.This was a terrible idea, and here's why.Physical voting is centuries old. In thattime, pretty much every conceivable methodof fraud has been tried, and has since beendefended against. Because of that, attackson physical voting don't scale well. It takesso much effort, so many people and it onlytakes one person to leak your conspiracy andthe whole thing falls apart.Electronic voting, though? You can attackwith one person. It can take about the sameeffort to change one vote as it does to changea million. And it can be done without evensetting foot in the country whose electionsyou're trying to rig.There are two key parts of an election. Anonymity,and trust. First of all, anonymity. You cannotlet anyone pay, bribe, or threaten in orderto change someone's vote. If you put any identifyingmark on your paper ballot, if you sign it,if you write your name on it, if you do anythingthat could, in theory, be used to check howyou voted, your vote is thrown out and ignored,just so no-one can be forced or bribed tovote a certain way.And yet, because you marked your vote, andyou put it into a sealed box, and that boxwas only unsealed when it was surrounded byeveryone with a stake in the election, youknow that your vote has still been counted,even though you'll never see it again.That's the other key: trust. You never, ever,ever, trust any one individual. Ideally, youdon't trust any two, or three. People canbe bribed, can be threatened, can be incompetent.I mean, hell, people have been all three ofthose things. But like I said: the more physicalvotes you want to change, the more peopleit takes and the less possible your attackgets. Everyone can see what's happening andkeep an eye on each other, particularly ifthey don't trust the other side.So let's talk about voting machines.Problem 1: Auditing the software and hardwareIn theory, you could have open source softwarethat everyone has checked and everyone ishappy with and that's been used for years.In theory. Never mind that you only actuallydo a full-scale test of this software everyfew years when there's actually an election,let's say theoretically it can be done.But how do you make sure that software iswhat's actually loaded on that voting machinein front of you on the day of the election?And I know that immediately, someone is goingto want to comment about checksums or crypto.Which is great, except now you have to trustthe software that's checking that hash. Ormore likely, the one person that's checkingit for you. You've just moved the problem.And if you're thinking \"I could verify that\",then turn your brain the other way, and think\"how could I break that?\" because there aretrillions of dollars -- that's not an exaggeration-- riding on the result of big elections,and that's an incredible motivation. If you'recoming up with sneaky ways to get around it...believe me, so are lots of other people.It might be one angry techie, but it mightbe an entire political party, or the hugecorporations who want one party to win, orentire nation states who want one party towin.And all that is assuming you're even allowedto verify the software that's running, whichyou never are, because plugging unknown USBsticks into a voting machine is a bad idea.Not that that stops people plugging unknownUSB sticks into a voting machine. It has literallyhappened. Let's remember, these machines haveto be left in a room with the voter and no-oneelse in order for them to cast their voteanonymously. Oh, by the way, the machinesare frequently programmed by sticking a USBinto each of them in turn, so if you compromisethe first one, jackpot.In practice, you don't have open source software,you have proprietary, unaudited software whichyou just have to trust. This is real, by theway, around the world, there are some electionsthat run on this. And remember what I said?This is an election. You don't trust.And maybe you're thinking, you could havean audit trail, you could have a paper backupthat the machine prints out as you vote. Inwhich case, congratulations, you've just inventedthe world's most expensive pencil. One ofthe reasons Britain gives people pencils forvoting, by the way, is because we're worriedthat pens might be switched by any voter tocontain disappearing ink. Erasing pencil ballots?Takes time, and if you can do that, you canjust throw them away. Disappearing ink? Itmight be an urban legend, but it might actuallybe a plausible attack vector. This is thelevel of paranoia we need to work at here.And don't think you can get away with allthis by using a pile of paper ballots andjust counting them electronically, either:an electronic counting machine is still ablack box that a pile of ballots goes intoand a mysterious number comes out of. They'vegot exactly the same problems.Problem 2: Votes In TransitThere are three ways of moving the magic electronicballot numbers from the voting machines tothe final count.You could treat the machine like a regularballot box, you seal it in a plastic bag,move the physical machine with two peoplein the vehicle to the count, and then unsealit there. No-one does this.You could copy the result onto a handy USBstick and move that instead. Do I need torun through how easily... no. Okay.Or, and this is what usually happens, youcould tell the voting machine to upload theresults over the internet, optionally througha third central server, and potentially notover a secure connection, and probably withoutany checksums or tests. [exasperating]Problem 3: Central Count ProgramAnd right at the end, there's the programthat takes all these numbers, all these votes,and produces a final count. Now you've gotall the same problems you have with the individualvoting machines, except now only a few peoplecan even see that machine, and it's been hiddenaway in a private warehouse somewhere forthe last few years. Good luck verifying that.And all this -- all this -- is before we eventalk about online voting.I could talk about all the ways which youcould hijack ballots, block an email address-- because after Hurricane Sandy, the ballotswere sent by email -- or any of the ways youcould do a man-in-the-middle attack on that.All possible.And those are just if it's a well designedsystem.There are reports of actual live electionswhere there were cross-site scripting attacksin the e-voting page, where they'd misspelledone party's name, and where they'd put thewrong party's logo next to a candidate. Sorry,did I say elections? I meant election. Thatwas all the same election, it was in Hampshirein 2007.But never mind all that.Depending on which security company you believe,somewhere around 5% and 50% of desktop computersare infected with something. And that's justthe scammers trying to set up botnets andminor extortions using private computers.If you want to affect a load of votes, tryinfecting the computers at the public library.But never mind all that.We've seen what big scary countries and bigscary corporations can do when they put theirmind to it. Given that someone designed animmensely complicated worm that spread aroundthe world just to break some Iranian centrifuges,imagine what someone could do if they wantedto throw an online election.Remember, again, when you hear \"just trustus\", or \"just trust me\", or \"it's a computer,it doesn't go wrong\" in an election, somethinghas already gone disastrously wrong.Imagine all this electronic voting, only withoutcomputers. Would you be happy walking up tosomeone anonymous in a ballot box, or worse,calling a number on your phone, just tellingthem your vote -- but they promise to keepit secret -- and at the end of the electionall those people, who have been sitting ontheir own, phone up one other person in privateand tell their results, and then that finalperson -- who promises to count it all upaccurately -- announces who's won? Becausethat's essentially what electronic votingis. It is a terrible idea, and if a governmentever promises to use it, hope they don't manageit before you get a chance to vote them out.",

   "title": "Hacking Websites with SQL Injection - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "09 Oct 2013",
   "transcription": "There's actually been a debateover how I should pronounce this.I call it sequel injection.The acronym is SQL.Whichever way you call it,it's a way to attack websites,that really shouldn't work any more, but still does.Sequel or SQL is a language inwhich you talk to databases,and it's fairly...it's fairly like English actually.You can actually say things like,\"Select from this table.\"It's not a complicated language.There are no great amounts of curly bracketsand semi-colons and things like that.It can be.But equally you can pretty much typecommands in near English into it,and you'll get results back from your database.And this has existed for years and years and years.And that was all fine until the Web came along,and now people are looking at websites and are thinking,\"These, these need to be hooked up to databases.\"Because way back, when Tim Berners-Leeinvented the World Wide Web,it was pretty much \"I'm gonna request a documentand you're gonna send that document back to me.\"Eventually people worked out thatwhat do you really wantedto do was send a documentand have different things comeback depending on what you sent.Maybe you could type in a search request,and that would go to a databaseand pull back something.That's great, that's brilliant, that's a wonderful invention.And unfortunately, some programminglanguages dealt with this in a sensible way,and some did not.And one of the most notable onesthat didn't is a language called PHP.I'm a PHP coder. It's a veryeasy language to write in.It's a friendly language. I still haven't met anyother language that lets me develop codeat the speed that I am able to.It's very fault-tolerant,within reason.It doesn't always give you the bestresults when it does, but, you know,it's friendly, it's easy to pick up and cruciallyyou can just write it into a text file, uploadit to a web server (in most of the world),and it will just work.You can type in PHP code and have it just run.So the barrier to entry is really, really low.Which in one way is brilliant. It makes webprogramming much more accessible.Facebook was originally written in PHP.Innumerable things have originally beenwritten in PHP and loads of things still are.WordPress still is.The trouble is, that if you're not careful,there's a lot of ways to go wrong.And this isn't just PHP,but I'll use it as a example.You talk to a database byissuing a command like this.SELECT * FROM usersWHERE username equals\"tom\"Great!And the database will send back all thedetails it knows about the user called \"tom\".Brilliant!But the catch is those quotation marks.Because if I'm not careful about what I send,then we can cause some problems.Let's say, for example, that I have a webform that lets me login and I type in tom,and it sends that and brings back \"tom\".OK?Now lets say I type in tom with a quote mark in it,and if you are not careful, what will happenis the language will send something like this.SELECT * FROM users WHERE usernameequals\"tom\" and then I put a quote markin, and then it puts a quote mark in.It fails because the quote marks don't match up.And the whole thing crashesand it just sends back an error.That's mildly annoying,and a big problem, of course, is puttingin any text that has quote marks.The catch is you can doa lot of damage that way.Because that languagedoesn't just have SELECT.It has INSERT to add new stuff.It has UPDATE to change stuff.And it has DELETE to remove stuff.So if I was to send, say,a username that was 'tom\";',and then put anothercommand in there, like,'delete everything'.Its not a literal command,but something like that.It would work.So we have a look how that works.We've got the normal command,\"SELECT * FROM usersWHERE username [mumbles] 'tom'\"\"Long command there.But when you put in 'tom',I'm gonna send that,and then I'm gonna send this:DROP ALL DATABASES;Hit enter, it will get convertedinto a plain English command,in SQL language,it will get sent,and database will go\"Well that's exactly what I should do.\"It's gonna understand that there's a new command atthe semi-colon and that it should delete everything.The main way around it is escaping.When there is dangerouscharacter, like a quote mark,you put a slash before it.And by 'you' I mean you, theprogrammer writing this.You go through, and youuse a function that says,\"Everywhere there is a quotemark, put this slash before it.And before you send it tothe database, you do that.\"Input comes in from the user,add some slashes to it to make it safe,send it out to the database.And the database looks atthose slashes and goes,\"Right, every time there's one ofthose, this thing that's coming next?Just treat it as a regular quote mark.Don't treat it anything special, it'sin the text, just treat it as that.\"And if you wanna send an actualslash, you send two slashes:the first one to say \"Treat the nextone as a real character\", and then...It works, but it's clunky.And for a while, this kind of \"Sendthe command in plain English\"was the only way to make thingswork in a couple of languages,including PHP, the most commonly usedweb programming language in the world.To make this worse, the command to addthose slashes was the wonderfully unwieldy:mySQL (it's the name of the database.)_real_escape_string. And then youput whatever text you want there.\"escape_string\" being what you want it to do,\"mySQL\" being the name of the database,and \"real\", because the first one didn't workand they couldn't change itbecause of backwards compatibility.So, anyone who'd used the original string,which is, like, more than 10 years ago now,but anyone who'd usedthe original form of this:completely insecure.Rather than patch that, theyjust added the word \"real\".Anyone who forgot to add that, or hadn'tread through all the documentation?Yep. Anyone can come along andeffectively delete your database.Or do more subtle things, like update other people'saccounts or read other people's passwords.Because once you've got access to thedatabase, if you work out how it works,there's really not much you can't do.And the thing is, it is soeasy to get this wrong.If you get this wrong justonce, anywhere in your code,and there are lots of really subtle ways thatI'm not gonna get into to get this wrong,it's not just a case offorgetting to escape quotes.There are lots of reallysubtle ways to get it wrong.If you do that, then your web app is vunerable.And if someone figuresout that there's a way in there,because they try and create ausername with a quote mark in it,then good luck! Say goodbyeto everyone's passwords.The way it should be done issomething called prepared statements,and if you are programminganything to do with a database,you should be using preparedstatements right now.The way they work is...It's a hack.It's a hack on top of a hack, because, let's be honest,sending that kind of plain English SQLcommand from a programming language,that's a hack, and then we've had to put more on top ofthat, and more on top of that, and more on top of that.But prepared statementsat least keeps it safe.With prepared statements,you send the query.You send \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username =\"and then you just say '?'.And that question mark, you then latersay \"Right, this is the data I'm putting in.This is not a command.Don't do anything to this,no matter what it looks like.This is unsafe.Just take it, treat it very gingerly, store it in thedatabase and don't look at it beyond that.\"It's a little more complicated than that, I am simplifyingmassively for, you know, talking to a camera.And if you are web programming,you should look up the recent securityguidelines of what you should do, etc, etc, etc.But,this is what you should be using.Because right now,if you're not using prepared statements, it takesone mistake, anywhere in your application,one thing where you'veforgotten to put a quote mark in,or messed it up in some subtle waythat it uses Unicode characters,or something wonderfully complicated,particularly if you're using a Microsoft database.That's from someone that uses Windows.If you're not using preparedstatements, you are vulnerable,and you need to fix that.But in the mean time, as hacksgo, there are worse ones.",

   "title": "Floating Point Numbers - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "22 Jan 2014",
   "transcription": "People expect computers to be entirely accurate and precise with numbers.You know, you grow up with calculators.You expect that if you type in:\"0.1 + 0.2\", you expect it to come out to \"0.3\".And sooner or later every programmer, as they're learning,tries something like that. And they type it into a programming language.Something like \"0.1 + 0.2\",and they will hit Enter,and what the computer will give themis something like \"0.300000000...1\".And at that point, they will have started to learn about floating point numbers,and they will be starting to tear their hair out.Floating point numbers are essentially scientific notation.For the uninitiated, let's sayyou're an astrophysicist,and you have the speed of light,which is this enormous number with eight 0s after it.And you want to multiply it by a tiny distance.It doesn't really matter what we're measuring here, it's just a big number and a small number.Let's say, 0.00000015.Let's say you want to multiply these two together.(I may have made this a bit deliberately easy.)You could try and do some really complicated maths and work it all out,but you don't need to.Because in scientific notation,this is 3 times 10 to the 8,and this one is 1.5 times 10 to the -7.So you don't need to do anything particularly complicated to multiply these two together.All you have to do is multiply these,which is 4.5,and then add these exponents together here.So, 8 add -7, eight minus seven means that's 1.So we'll have 4.5 times 10 to the 1, or 4.5 times 10, or 45.Brilliant. That's much easier than trying to actually handle large numbers.And it also brings us to the concept of significant figures.Because the speed of light isn'texactly 3 times 10 to the 8.It's 2.997[something], and there's a lot of digits on the end of therewhich don't really matter for everyday calculations.We round it up. We say it's 3 times 10 to the 8.Or maybe, for being precise, we say it's 2.997 times 10 to the 8,but we don't really worry about the numbers beyond that.Hold that thought. So, we'll come back to significant digits later.The two main advantages to floating point are speed and efficiency.Speed, because floating point has been built over many, many years.It is now lightning fast for computers to deal with.And efficiency, because it can deal with really big numbers --massive numbers, \"size of the universe\" numbers --and really small numbers -- \"size of an atom\" numbers --without needing enormous amounts of space.If you had a format that needed to include the size of the universeand the size of an atom, you'd need so many zeroes stored on both endsor you'd need something particularly complicated for a computer to work outthat it would either be really inefficient, storing one number as a megabyte,or you would need something that would bereally fiddly for a computerto work out as it tries to place all the zeroes and the numbers everywhere.Let's talk about base 10. Let's talk about us - people.(Let's talk about the lights being on all of a sudden. That's weird.)In base 10, in our normal human numbers,so you know ten digits - base 10,we have hundreds, tens, and units.You learn that in primary school.And over here, you have tenths, hundredths, and thousandths.So if you want to say \"one tenth\" in decimal,you say \"0.1\",and that's normal, and that's natural.Base 2, on the other hand, binary..., computers..., they don't do that.Because what they see are fours, twos, and ones.And then over here: halves, quarters, eighths and sixteenths.There's no 0.1 in there.In fact, 0.1 in binary is \"0.00011\", and that \"0011\" is recurring.It's actually 0.00011001100110011... all the way to infinity.Which is interesting, because 32-bit computers,the ones we generally use,(we've moved a bit on now)32-bit computers only store 23 significant digits.They also store where the decimal point is.They basically do scientific notation in base 2.That's what floating point is.So they say, \"All right, so we've got this long binary number,times 2 to the something.\"And that's a problem. Because what it loses is precision.It doesn't understand recursion.I have an analogy for that in base 10:if you try to write \"a third\" as a decimal, we go:hundreds, tens, units, tenths, hundredths, thousandths,and then, we try and do this and we end up with0.333333333... recurring.Now imagine you don't understand recurring numbers, like a computer,like scientific notation if you take away that recursion,like floating point arithmetic doesn't.So this is where we bring everything together.If you're in base 10, if you're in decimal,let's say you have 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3.As humans we go, \"Well that's 0.3 recurring,plus 0.3 recurring,plus 0.3 recurring, which is 1.\"But say you're a computer and you don't understand recursion,because floating point math is essentially significant figures.So a computer would look at that and go,\"0.333333333...plus 333..., plus 333...\", and it will say,\"Well, a third plus a third plus a third.Total it to 0.99999999...\"But after a while, you'll stop. Because you've run out of digits.What you've just got there is a floating point rounding error.Let's take it down again to base 2. Let's do 1/10 + 2/10.Which is 0.00011001100110011...Oh! We've run out of digits!Because floating point arithmetic on 32-bit computers only stores 23 digits.And then you try and add 2/10, which is0.001100110011...I'm not going to try and do that maths,because it's going to take agesbut what happens is exactly the sameas back here.After 23 digits in 32-bit arithmetic(I think we've got 56 on 64-bit computers)it cuts. It doesn't understand recurring,which means that floating point looks at 1/10 + 2/10, what you just typed in,\"0.1 + 0.2\" in decimal, and it says that 1/10 + 2/10does NOT quite equal 3/10.Because, to its mind, it doesn't.For nearly all cases, it IS close enough.In most cases, you don't need more than 23 binary digits of precision.If you do, you go to 64-bit.If you are doing a 3D game and you need to know where to point something on the screen,it doesn't matter if it's 1/100000 of a pixel outbecause it will be in the right place.And if you're doing big calculations, it doesn't matter if a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction --something smaller than a molecule -- is out,because it will look more or less right:right beyond any precision or tolerance that the real world could possibly manage.But it means that if you're dealing with currency, and you say thatyou are adding 10p (or \u00a30.1) to 20p, every programmer hits this sooner or later,we just go like that. That's easy.A computer will come back and say, \"That's actually... that many pence.\"And in these particular human things, we will notice the errorbecause suddenly to usit's very, very obvious.That's the problem with floating point. To fix that, by the way, if you're doing currency,you either use a decimal type in more advanced programming languagesor you just store everything as an integer in terms of pence, cents, or whateverand then divide by 100 at the end.Floating point is something that really, really confuses a lot of people.It's tough to get your head arounduntil you realize that it is just scientific notation.It's the same thing that we learned in maths class at school, only in base 2.It's halves and quarters and eighths,and once you crack that, once you realize that it's storing a set length of numberand then working out where the decimal point could beand it's just significant figures,it starts to become a lot easier.And you start to realize,\"Oh, that's why if i type 0.1 + 0.2, what I get isn't 0.3.\"",

   "title": "Why C is so Influential - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "25 Aug 2017",
   "transcription": "There are very good reasons for Coccupying a special place in thefirmament of languages, although I thinkone thing to say at the outset is [that] reallyit finds its maximum power - it's maximumraison d'etre for even existing at all - if youthink of it as being the classicalsystem implementation language. Again, foryounger viewers, it's going to be hard tounderstand and comprehend this. But ifyou go back to the early mainframe erayou're getting really, really, powerfulcomputers - well by those days' standards -coming along, from the early 60sonwards. They were so expensive they hadto be time-shared between lots of usersand that in turn means you've got tohave system software that can multitaskbetween different people, differentpeople's programs loaded in themachine at the same time, all being time-sliced with a little bit of time. But atthe same time, increasingly, computersystems had to evolve into not justbeing able to print out your output andyour answers but to store it in afile; they had to run file systems. Andby the early 1970s you are in thisincredible situation that one of thebiggest challenges in programming - areal-time challenge where you had tokeep people happy - was nothing more orless than the operating system in yourcomputer. One of the hardest challengesgoing. And, yet, the wisdom was: \"You willonly ever be able to do this inassembler\". Some of the low-level tricksyou need to do in operating systems - youknow the `real man' attitude: \"Real Men useAssembler!\" And I think a lot of peoplesaid: \"No, there's some truth in that buton the other hand just a little bit ofhigher-level operations - if only it couldbe done without slowing the languagedown too much would help us stay sane. I think a lot ofpeople, gradually, were, if you like,embellishing assemblers to become macro-assemblers to try and give the kind ofhigher-level approach to things that yougot in high level languages. But on theother side the opposing armies were alwayssaying: \"High-level languages -  they're soinefficient! You need assembler foreverything, ideally\". Moore's Law put paid tothat, y'know. Yes, we can afford to usehigh-level languages for a lot morethings. In the early 70s, then, therewere a lot of experiments in trying, usually, to adapt existing languages forsystem implementation use. Andparticularly ones that had started tobuild in some low-level operations forbit twiddling. It was getting importantto be able to dig down to the byte level andget out characters. Looming up, just onthe horizon, shock! horror! as if 16 bitswasn't a toy computer - 8 bits [was] coming.So you needed a language to evolve thatcould cope with different widths ofobjects. Of course as it becomes ... you gothrough a sort of - like a minimum - in thecurve. You know - we have to chop thingsdown in size because otherwise we can'tmake it at a price that people will buy.But then, as hardware becomes cheaper,generally you then turn the corner. Andyou could see it even in DEC andtheir [16-bit] PDP-11 minicomputers. Soon enoughthey come along with a 32-bit computer[the VAX] which they can afford to make at longlast. And, of course, that was the era whendiscrete transistors and components, onprinted circuit boards, gave way to chiptechnology. So you had, like, LSI-11s.It's large-scale integration, it's notseparate components any more. Andgradually the curve turns the other way>> Sean: How did this change in architecturefeed back into the language choices then?>> DFB: Well, I think that it's two things. Firstof all, can you get a system implementationlanguage that helps you do low-levelthings at a higher level? And I stillthink that, probably, you could saythat the most successful of all time - onthat front - was C. It's not that there weren'tothers. There were things like Bliss, therewere things like, even, Algol 68. And otherhigh-level languages, BCPL, were tried out.But C had the great advantage that youcould see how you might port it. Ah! yeah!Dennis, Ken all that. They're doing it onthe PDP-11; they'll be doing it on theVAX but up come the SUNs, all of asudden. The SUN servers. Hey! can we portUNIX to this? We're porting UNIX - we got toget the C compiler working! Can you getthe C compiler working - yes ofcourse you can. And it really stood thetest of time. I mean when you look now, inthe `gcc' compiler, at the architecturesthat are supported, it just writes itsown brochure saying: \"Just look at this, wecan cope with anything!\" However, the otherside of that, was then thedifferentiation to, if you like,higher-level languages - even imperativeones - just became more marked. And I thinkit was very interesting that - I think itwas in the mid to late 80s - James Goslingof Sun effectively ... it's people whorun programmers and see how manymistakes they make when they're usingpointers. And, as far as I recall it, oneof the design requirements of Java was:\"We're gonna ban pointers at user level\".When we start looking at whyprograms go wrong it's people who'vemade mistakes with pointers. So thereforewe're gonna ban them. I'm actually notagainst that. If you really don't need todo low-level manipulations of pointersthen let the language do it for you.Or if it's like C++ where you could dothem and you say I don't want to do allmy clever stuff under the hood - I'm notwriting an operating system. Yeah! gethold of a library full of functions andtrust them because they'll have beentested. They'll be efficient and all this kindof thing.  So, yes, things like functionallanguages [e.g. Haskell], which of course always used to -still do! -  get flak for being so slow,They became more and more possible to doI suppose Brian [Kernighan] might say they got`less and less inefficient' y'know. Butno, it was a liberation to have that muchcompute power around that you didn'thave to think too much. I'm glad thatmany sensible souls on the commentstreams of recent videos have said this.It's no good getting theological about:\"You're not a real programmer if you don'tprogram in C\" or anything silly likethat. You've got to have an attitude of`horses for courses': the right programminglanguage for the right task. If it'syelling out to use Python, use Python. Ifit's yelling out to use AWK - as I'vebeen known to do ... Yeah! I tried out, as youknow, my Reed-Muller `messages from Mars'I got it ... hacked it together in AWK.Well, why not? You can always take theview that if it's not efficientenough we can drive down to a lowerlevel, more efficient, language. But theability to try things out, without themtaking hours and hours - because of reallyfast hardware - is probably about thebiggest liberation I can think of interms of my professional career as acomputer scientist. >> Sean: You know I'm not a programmer. I mean, one day it might make avideo - my bad exploration of BASIC in myyouth. But, as a non programmer I supposeI come at this and think, well, why can'tthere be one thing that fits all and mykind of taking examples fromother parts of life. Presumably certainthings are good for certain things like you say>>> DFB:  I think that's right. I think thatyou see it in all sorts of other realmsin life. It's that you know the trueprofessional tool for doing something - itwas probably very different from a user-leveltool.  Y' know, I mean, if you go to ahardware store and buy yourself a drillwith a hammer action, you know that's avery different object from what theywould use industrially to hack intobuildings. It's in principle the same butthe whole spec. and construction of itis very different. And that's what wenow have the ability to do, is to fit the language to the task.Of course, it still leaves a big problemthat lots and lots of software ideallyshould have been rewritten years ago.Because the moment you get somethingthat's good for its time, and works, thetemptation is just to leave it in placebecause it works and we daren't change it because so many things are dependent on it.So, this is why there are still 8-bit Z80programs doing heaven knows what in theArmed Forces. There are probably still companies outthere, in the wild, still using COBOL onmainframes. You know [the] cost of a mainframesimulation these days? Peanuts! Thatprogram [will] cost us a fortune to rewrite it.And it's bound to go wrong, And it's knownand reliable so that thing about havinglegacy software and hardware and it's sodifficult to trust to replacing it. It'sstill is going to be a problem eternally I think, that. >> Sean: well there is awell-known phrase: \"If it ain't broken, don't fix it!\" >> DFB: What's helped the `ain't broken'bit, you see, that's the thing, is that ifthere's something rather exotic on thehardware front, from the 1960s, you nolonger have to literally build one ofthose. You can simulate its action. So aslong as you put a lot of effort intogetting a good simulator going, then youcan carry on with the code you've hadfor 30-40 years in some cases.",

   "title": "Buffer Overflow Attack - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "02 Mar 2016",
   "transcription": "So, we'll talk about something very different today; very different to my normal image filtering videos -- and that is \"buffer overflow exploits\" and what they are and how you do them.Which is kinda funI'm obviously somewhat of a geek, I quite like these sort of things - low level memory exploits.A buffer overflow exploit is a situation where -- we're using some, probably low-level C function or something to write a string -- or some other variable - into a piece of memory that is only a certain length.But we're trying to write something in that's longer than that -- and it then overwrites the later memory addresses, and that can cause all kinds of problems.The first thing we should talk about, probably, is roughly what happens in memory with a program when it's run.Now, we're talking about C programmes in Linux today, just because I happen to have a Linux VM running here and it's easier.But this will apply to many different languages and many different operating systems.So, when a programme is run by the operating system... so we're in some shell and we type in a command to run a programmeThe operating system will effectively call, as a function, the main method of your code.But your actual process, your executable, will be held in memory in a very specific way.And it's consistent between different processes.So, we have a big block of RAM. We don't know how big our RAM is because it can be varied, but -- we use something called Virtual Memory Address Translation to say that -- everything in here, this is 0. 0x000...This is the bottom of the memory, as it wereAnd up here is 0xFFF. So, this is the equivalent of \"11111111\" memory address -- all the way up to 32 or 64 bits, and this is 0.Now, when you use this, there are certain areas of this memory that are always allocated to certain things.So, up here we have kernel things. So, this will be command line parameters that we can pass to our programme -- and environment variables and so on.Down here we have something called the text. That's the actual code of our programme.The machine instructions that we've compiled get loaded in there.Now that's read-only, because we don't want to be messing about down there.In here we have data. So, uninitialised and initialised variables get held here.And then we have the heap. Now, the heap may have been mentioned from time to time.It's where you allocate large things in your memory.Big area of memory that you can allocate huge chunks on to do various things.What you do with that is, of course, up to your programme.And then up here, perhaps the most important bit, in some ways anyway, is the stack.Now the stack holds the local variables for each of your functions -- and when you call a new function like, let's say you say \"printf\" and then some parameters -- that gets put on the end of the stack.So, the heap grows in this direction as you add memory, and the stack grows in this direction.Now that I've laid that out, we won't talk about it any more; we'll just focus on the stack, because that's where a lot of these buffer overflows happen.You can have overflows in other areas, but we're not going to be dealing with them today.I'm going to turn this sideways, because I think it's a little bit easier to understand. At least that's how I tend to look at it.This is our memory again, nice and big. This is now our stack area (excuse my programmer's writing).Up here we have the high memory addresses (0xff...) So, something up here is high...... and this is 0x000. Now, of course, the stack won't be taking up this whole region but it doesn't matter.So, there are high memory addresses and low memory addresses.And the stack grows downwards, so when we add something onto the end of the stack it gets put on this side and moves in this direction.Of course, I'm talking about a stack without telling you what a stack is.Professor Brailsford has already talked about this and has probably done a much better job of explaining it than I would!Brailsford: There's a lot of computer science that depends on stacks. I sometimes think stacks and trees are just about all computer science is about.So we'll just say that you know how a stack works and then we'll move on!We have some programme that's calling a function. A function is some area of code that does something and then returns back to where it was before.So, this is our calling function here..When the calling function wants to make use of something, it adds its parameters that it's passing onto the stack.This will be parameter A and this will be parameter B, and they will be added into the stack in reverse order.And then the Assembler code for this function will make something called a \"call\" -- and that will jump to somewhere else in memory and work with these two things.And it's the nature of this stack that causes us to have problems.Let's look at some code and then we'll see how it works.I've got myself here a program that isn't very good. I wrote it.So, it's a piece of C code, so if we look at it...It's a very simple C code that allocates some memory on the stack and then copies a string into it from the command line.So up here we've got the main function for C that takes the number of parameters given and a pointer to those variables that you've got.And they'll be held in kernel area of our memory.We've allocated a buffer that's 500 characters long and then we call a function called \"string copy\" (strcopy) -- which will copy our command line parameter from argv into our buffer.Our function puts on a return address which is replacing the code we need to go back to once we've done strcopy.So that's how main knows where to go after it's finished.And then we put on a reference to the base pointer in our previous function. We won't worry about that too much because it's not relevant particularly to this video.This is just going to be our EBP base pointer.This is our allocated space for our buffer, and it's 500 long.If we write into it something that's longer than 500, we're going to go straight past the buffer, over this, and crucially over our return variable.And that's where we point back to something we shouldn't be doing.What I'm going to do is walk through it in the code and then let's see if it works.So this is my Kali Linux distribution, which has all kinds of slightly dubious password cracking tools and other penetration testing tools.It's meant for ethical hacking, let's just make that clear!I've written here a small function that does our copy from the command line.Now I've compiled it and I can run it. So I can run my vulnerable code with \"Hello\".And that will copy \"Hello\" into this buffer and then simply return, so nothing happens.It's the most boring programme ever![Sean Riley offscreen] Another program might do something like copy \"Hello\" in there and now it's in the buffer they can go off and process it?Yeah, I mean maybe you've got a function that makes things all uppercase.So you copy \"Hello\" off and then you change this new copy to be all uppercase, and then you output it to the screen.And this doesn't have to be \"main()\", this could be any function.We're going to run something called GDB, which is the Linux command line debugger.Erm...I wouldn't advice using GDB unless you really like seeing lots of Assembly and doing really low-level Linux things.[Sean Riley offscreen] There's a lot of text on the screen now so we don't have to worry about - [cut off]No, this text here is just warranty information.So now I'm going to type in \"list\" -- and it shows use the code for our function. So we can see it's just a compiled function.It knows this because the compiler included this information along with the executable.We can also show the machine code for this so we can say \"disas main\" and we can see the code for \"main()\".[Sean Riley offscreen] So they're the instructions that would actually go to the CPU?These are the actual CPU instructions that will be run.Now we won't dwell on much of this, because Assembly is perhaps a whole series of talks by someone other than me!Steve Bagley knows a lot about Assembler.However, a couple of really important things are:This line here, sub of 0x1f4 from %esp, that's allocating the 500 for the buffer.That is we're here and we go 500 in this direction and that's where our buffer goes.So buffer's sitting to the left in this image but is lower in memory than the rest of our variables.Now...We can run this programme from GDB- and if it crashes, we can look at the registers and find out what's happenedSo we can say \"run Hello\" and it will start the programme and say \"Hello\".And it's exited normally.Now, we can pass something in a little bit longer than \"Hello\".If we pass something that's over 500, then this buffer will go over this base pointer and this return value, and break the code.[Sean Riley offscreen] So that will just crash your-It should just crash it. Python, for example, can produce strings based on simple scripts on the command lineSo what we do is we say \"run\" and then we pass it a Python script of print... 41 (that's the \"a\" character\"), let's say 506 times.Just a little bit more than 500 so it's going to cause somewhat of a problem but not a catastrophe. [Chuckling] Okay?And then we run that.And it's received a segmentation fault. Now a segmentation fault is what a CPU will send back to you when you're trying to access something in memory you shouldn't be doing.Now that's not actually happened because we overwrote somewhere we shouldn't; what's happened is the return address was half overwritten with these 41s.[Sean Riley offscreen] So it doesn't know what it is?Yeah, there is nothing in memory at 0xb7004141, and if there is, it doesn't belong to this process. It's not allowed, so it gets a segmentation fault.So if we change this to 508, we're going two bytes further along, which means we're now overwriting the entirety of our return address.We're overwriting this \"ret\" here with 41s. Now if there were some virus code at 414141, that's a big problem. So that's where we're going with this.So we run this, and you can see the return address is now 0x414141.I can actually show you the registers and you can see that the construction pointer is now trying to point to 0x414141.So that means that it's read this return value and tried to return to that place in the code and run it, and of course it can't.Now we can have a little bit more fun. We've broken our code, what can we do now?Well, what we need to do is change this return value to somewhere where we've got some payload we're trying to give- we're trying to produce. Okay?So luckily, if I quit this debugger, I have some pre-prepared payload just for this occassion!Now in fact this payload is just a simple, very short programme in Assembler, that puts some variables on the stack and then executes a system call to tell it to run a shell -- to run a new command line.If I show this code, our shell code, this code will depend on the Linux operating system and whether you're using an Intel CPU or something else.This is just a string of different commands. Crucially, this xcd / x80 is throwing a system interrupt, which means that it's going to run the system call.That's all we're going to do about this. What this will actually do is run something called ZSH, which is an old shell that doesn't have a lot of protections involved.Let's go back to our debugger.And... we're going to run again but this time we're going to run a slightly more malicious piece of code.We're going to put in our \\x41s timesed by 508 - and then we're going to put in our shell code. There we go, okay?So now we're doing all 41s and then a bunch of malicious code. Now that's actually too long; we've gone too far. But we'll fix that in a minute, okay?And finally, the last thing we want to add in is our return address, which we'll customise in a moment.To craft an exploit from this, what we need to do is remember the fact that strcopy is going to copy into our buffer.So we're going to start here. We want to overwrite the memory of this return address with somewhere pointing to our malicious code.Now, we can't necessarily know for sure where our malicious code might be stored elsewhere on the disc, so we don't worry about that or memory.We want to put it in this buffer. So we're going to put some malicious code in here and then we're going to have a return address that points back into it.Okay... now...Memory moves around slightly. When you run these programmes, things change slightly, environment variables are added and removed, things move around.So, we want to try and hedge our bets and get the rough area that this will go in.In here, we put in something called a No-Op sled. Or, y'know, there's various other words for it.So this is simply \\x90. That is a machine instruction for \"just move to the next one\". So that's good.Anywhere we land in that No-Op is going to tick along to our malicious code.So we have a load of \\x90s here... then we have our shell code, right?That's our malicious payload that runs our shell.And then we have the return address, right in the right place, that points back right smack in the middle of these \\x90s.And what that means is, even if these move a bit, it'll still work.[Sean Riley offscreen] So it's like having a slope almost, is it?It's exactly like that, yes. Anywhere where we land in here is going to cause a real problem for the computer-[Sean Riley offscreen] So we've got our bomb, or our... I dunno... pit of lava [laughs]Yep, it's a Sarlacc pit isn't it and your No-Op sled takes you in and you get digested over 10,000 years or whatever it is.So we've got three things we need to do. We need to put in some \\x90s, we need to put in our shell code, which I've already got, and we need to put in our return address.Worry about the return address last, okay? So...If we go back to my code: we change the first \\x41s that we were putting in, and we change to 90. We're putting in a load of No-Op operations.Then we've got our shell code and then we've got what will eventually be our return address.And we'll put in 10 of those because it's just to have a little bit of padding between our shell code and our stack that's moving about.This 508 here, people will have noticed, now this is too big, because we're putting in extra information.So, if we write 508 bytes, it goes exactly where we want: over our return address.But we've now got 43 bytes of shell code and we've got 40 bytes of return address.So... -40... -43... is 425. We'll change this 508 to 425, and so now this exploit here that we're looking at is exactly what I hoped it would be here.Some \\x90 no operation sleds, the shell code and then we've got our return address, which is 10 times four bytes.We run this and we've got a segmentation fault, which is exactly what we hoped we'd get because our return address hasn't been changed yet.So now let's look at our memory and work out where our return address should go.So in GDB, it's paused the programme after the segmentation fault, so we can say \"list the registers\", let's say about 200 of them, at the stack point of -550.So that's going to be right at the beginning of our buffer. And what we're seeing here is a load of 90s in a row.So we just need to pick a memory address right in the middle of them, so let's pick this one, let's say 0xbffffaba -- and write that down so I don't forget it.Now, there's a nice quirk in this, which is that Intel CPUs are little ednian, which means I have to put it in backwards.It's yet more things we have to learn, but it's fine!b-f... f-f... f-a... Oops, put my caps-lock on... Can't type with people watching! Errrrm... and er, b-a.Theoretically when I run this, what will happen is string copy will do its thing: it'll copy a string in.And then, when it tries to return, it will load this return value and execute that instruction, which will be somewhere in this buffer.Then it will read off and run our shell code, so we should get a shell.Okay?[tappity tappity]And we did!So that's a good start, right? We know our program works. Albeit in a debugger with very little side effect.The question now is: can I take this and use it on a command line to gain access to this machine?Now...Linux has quite restrictive policies on what can and can't be done from certain programmes, but some programmes, such as changing your password, are run using something called SUID.So what that means is that, for the sake of running that programme, you have complete root access to that machine.Because otherwise, how could you change the password file? You're not normally allowed to even read it.The shadow file. So...If you find a vulnerability in that kind of programme, and there's more than I think there should be, then that's when there's a real problem.Now obviously these vulnerabilities are getting rarer, but it's catastrophic if you get one.So, let's leave this debugger and back to our nice clear command line environment.If I list the files we've got, this vulnerable programme here is shown in red, that shows that it's SUID root.Which means that when we run it, it will be running as root, which is not great for security.That and my shoddy programming, which means it's vulnerable to a buffer overflow.So, if I copy my exploit... here we go, this is a big moment of truth, where this whole video is going to work.I've put my code in just like it was in the debugger. I've tried to make it exactly the same so that the memory doesn't move around.Let's just say \"whoami\" on Linux, so we can see I am myself. I don't have root access.So can I, for example, look at the password file? So I can say \"cat /etc/shadow\".\"Permission denied\". No dice, okay. Fair enough. I'm not supposed to be looking at that.Now I'm on my exploit, so \"./envexec\", then my vulnerability, with the right address... now we've got a shell.\"whoami\"?Root.So now can I look at my shadow file? [Sean Riley offscreen] So root is like God for this system?In Linux, there is nothing you can't do with root.So I've got my root shell and I'm root, so I can \"cat /etc/shadow\", and I can see what's in the shadow file.But the point is that there's nothing I can't do now, I can wipe the machine, or do anything like that myself.And then I can quit this and then my programme just gracefully exits. Because it now returns to normal code.And, hopefully, no-one is any the wiser that anything's gone on.Now there are things that the operating system does to try and stop this from happening: randomising your memory layout and no executing of stacks and stuff.There are ways around this; they're obviously for a different video.But... at least things are getting definitely better.",

   "transcription": "There's a book just over your shoulder that's carefully been placed there, can you pick the book up and tell me about it? Right! Great book, you shouldbuy the newer version of this.Brief commercial announcement yeah sure I think I mentioned at some point in ourconversation the fact that the peopleworking on MULTICS, well MULTICS was sort of thesecond version of timesharing that wasdone at MIT with collaboration of BellLabs and General Electric very bigsystem for providing in effect a computingutility for programmers.Multex was actually being written in high-level languages ah they started with PL1which was not a good choice and thenthey moved to BCPLlanguage which developed in fact byMartin Richards of Cambridge.The people doing that who are at Bell Labs inparticular Ken Thompson and DennisRitchie had gotten used to the idea thatyou could write really interestingoperating system kind of software andtools that supported it in high-levellanguages so you weren't writingassembly language and so when theystarted working on UNIX this very smallstripped-down version that was done atBell Labs they were at the same timeexploring the use of high-levellanguages and there were a variety ofthese there was a language called Bwhich was the first attempt it was doneby Ken Thompson a very simple languageand I suppose you could say it was sortof like a stripped down version of BCPLA weak naming convention there andso you could do interesting things withB but it wasn't quite powerful enoughand in particular it was an interpreternot a compiler and that meant it didn'tgenerate machine code for the particularmachine was running on it was just aprogram thatinterpreted what it was trying to sayso it meant it ran relatively slowly.The other thing is that the language did not support the architecture of newermachines that were showing up inparticular that PDP 11 newer machinesinstead of having everything in themachine be a single size of in effect integerlet's say 16 bits or something like that they had different sizes that were, themachine would efficiently and naturallymanipulate 8bit, 16bit maybe thirtytwo-bit & the language B didn't reflectthat and so Dennis Ritchie undertookto design what amounted to a version ofB that was richer and had mechanismsin the language to say this is an 8-bitquantity this is a 16 bit quantitybasically the char and int types that you see in the early versions of C and so hewrotea compiler for that and then with thecompiler in hand they started to rewritethe operating system itself in Cand this took a while but something in theorder of six months to get that workingand at that point then you've got theoperating system of course all kinds ofother critical core software written ina high-level language rather than inassembly language and that's importantfor all kinds of reasons one is meansthat it's just a lot easier for lots ofpeople to see what the code does youneed so much expertise because it's ahigh-level language and the other thingis that it's portable in the sense thatif somebody makes a C compiler for adifferent kind of machine differentarchitecture then you can recompilewhatever your program is for that newarchitecture inthat way you can move your program to adifferent machine of this always beenthe advantage of high-level languagesbut now you could do it for the operatingsystem and that meant that UNIX, theoperating system no longer was only PDP11 but could run on a variety of othermachines as wellI think the concept of having a high-level language Iget right, you compile it down to hexes, machine code that tells the processors to do stuff. and if you have a different compiler for a different machineit just changes what those Hexes are -right that's exactly rightso so it should be really simple to understand how you write an OS in a high level language, but is it a bit like, making a sharp tool and using that sharp tool to make a sharper tool?Yeah, right, I think in fact, the complication is in building in writingof operating system and high-levellanguage in translating it into let'ssay multiple different architectures isthere's a lot of detail to get rightthere in there are some things which thehigh-level language just doesn't supportSo you need a little tiny bit of assemblylanguage assist for any given operatingsystem the one that's more like that theconceptual problem that you wereexplaining well is how does the compileritself get started because of course theC compiler is written in C so there is thehow do you get it started and your ideaof the sharper tool making yet a sharpertool and so onis metaphorically the right idea becausewhat you do is you say I wrote some codein C on paper let me mechanicallytranslate that into something that willprocess a bit more of C code andbootstrap myself up from that so it's abootstrapping process and I've neverdone it so take me with a grain of salton that but that's the basic idea so. - OK, so tell me about this book, how did this come about?that's the first edition (is it autographed?) this one isn't actually no dear oh dear this however isthe 24th printing so. (I'll just point out that Prof Brailsford brought in a pen for the autograph there.) OK I will autograph it...somewhere early on in this process ofpeople building interesting languages Igot intrigued by the idea of how do youexplain those languages to other peopleand so I wrote tutorial documents I wrote a tutorial document on B so thatpeople could learn B because Ken Thompsonand to a lesser degree Dennis didn'twrite tremendous amount of documentationlet's say it was a spare and there wasnot much tutorial stuff so I wrote atutorial document on B that was usefulwhen C came along then I wrote atutorial document on C and at some pointI had already written I guess couplebooks at that point and it seemed likethe market, the market!? That there mightbe a market for a C book and so Itwisted Dennis Ritchies arm intowriting the book with me and that is thesmartest thing I ever did in my wholelife no ambiguity so we took my tutorialdocument as kind of a piece of it, wetook his reference manual which is aexcellent reference manual as a bigpiece of it took that verbatim and thenwe filled in material in the middle to explain the various parts of the language at length, and wepublished that, we wrote it in 1977published at the beginning of 78 and ofcourse it was done with all of thedocument preparation tools that we hadbeen working on over the years and so ithadmathematical expressions in it using EQNit had tables of things likeoperators using Mike Lesk's TBL programitthe first edition predates pic thepicture drawing language the secondedition has pic pictures so on so isthis incestuous or is this building onwhat people have done I don't know butthat's how it came about and I remembertalking to the editor this is publishedby Prentice Hall with Karl Karlstrom theeditor there and I remember discussionwith him about how many copies do youthink this will sell no idea well maybefive thousanddone better than that which is just as wellthere never an A because B was based on?

   "title": "Characters, Symbols and the Unicode Miracle - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "20 Sep 2013",
   "transcription": "UTF-8 is perhaps the best hack,the best single thing that's usedthat can be written down on the back of a napkin,and that's how was it was put together.The first draft of UTF-8 was written on the back of a napkin in a dinerand it's just such an elegant hackthat solved so many problems and Iabsolutely love it.Back in the 1960s,we had teleprinters, we had simpledevices where you type a keyand it sends some numbers and the same letter comes out on the other side,but there needs to be a standard so inthe mid-1960sAmerica, at least, settled on ASCII, which is the American Standard Code for Information Interchange,and it's a 7-bit binary system,so each letter you type ingets converted into 7 binary numbers and sent over the wire.Now that means you can have numbers from 0 to 127.They sort of moved the first 32 for control codes and less important stuff for writing,things like like \"go down a line\" or backspace.And then they made the rest characters. They added some numbers, some punctuation marks.They did a really clever thing, which is that they made 'A' 65 which, in binary\u2014find 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\u2014in binary, 65 is 1000001,which means that 'B' is 66, which means you've got 2 in binary just here.C, 67, 3 in binary.So you can look at a 7-bit binary character and just knock off the first two digitsand know what its position in the alphabet is.Even cleverer than that, they started lowercase 32 later,which means that lowercase 'a' is 97\u20141100001.Anything that doesn't fit into that is probably a space, which conveniently will be all zeroes,or some kind of punctuation mark.Brilliant, clever, wonderful, great way of doing things,and that became the standard, at least in the English-speaking world.As for the rest of the world, a few of them did versions of that,but you start getting into other alphabets, into languages that don't really use alphabets at all.They all came up with their own encoding, which is fine.And then along come computers, and, over time, things change.We move to 8-bit computers, so we now have a whole extra number at the start just to confuse matters,which means we can go to 256! We can have twice as many characters!And, of course, everyone settled on the same standard for this, because that would make perfect s\u2014No. None of them did.All the Nordic countries start putting Norwegian characters and Finnish characters in there.Japan just doesn't use ASCII at all.Japan goes and creates its own multibyte encoding with more letters and more charactersand more binary numbers going to each individual character.All of these things are massively incompatible.Japan actually has three or four different encodings, all of which are completely incompatible with each other.So you send a document from one old-school Japanese computer to another,it will come out so garbled that there is even a word in Japanese for \"garbled characters,\"which is\u2014I'm probably mispronouncing this\u2014but it's \"mojibake.\"It's a bit of a nightmare, but it's not bad,because how often does someone in London have to send a documentto a completely incompatible and unknown computer at another company in Japan?In those days, it's rare. You printed it off and you faxed it.And then the World Wide Web hit, and we have a problem,because suddenly documents are being sent from all around the world all the time.So a thing is set up called the Unicode Consortium.In what I can only describe as a miracle, over the last couple of decades, they have hammered out a standard.Unicode now have a list of more than a hundred thousand charactersthat covers everything you could possibly want to write in any language\u2014English alphabet, Cyrillic alphabet, Arabic alphabet, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean characters.What you have at the end is the Unicode Consortium assigning 100,000+ characters to 100,000 numbers.They have not chosen binary digits. They have not chosen what they should be represented as.All they have said is that THAT Arabic character there, that is number 5,700-something,and this linguistic symbol here, that's 10,000-something.I have to simplify massively here because there are about,of course, five or six incompatible ways to do this,but what the web has more or less settled on is something called \"UTF-8.\"There are a couple of problems with doing the obvious thing, which is saying,\"OK. We're going to 100,000.That's gonna need, what... to be safe, that's gonna need 32 binary digits to encode it.\"They encoded the English alphabet in exactly the same way as ASCII did. 'A' is still 65.So if you have just a string of English text, and you're encoding it at 32 bits per character,you're gonna have about 20-something... 26? Yeah.26, 27 zeroes and then a few ones for every single character.That is incredibly wasteful.Suddenly every English language text file takes four times the space on disk.So problem 1: you have to get rid of all the zeroes in the English text.Problem 2: there are lots of old computer systems that interpret 8 zeroes in a row,a NULL, as \"this is the end of the string of characters.\"so if you ever send 8 zeroes in a row, they just stop listening.They assume the string has ended there, and it gets cut off,so you can't have 8 zeroes in a row anywhere.'K. Problem number 3: it has to be backwards-compatible.You have to be able to take this Unicode text and chuck it into something that only understands basic ASCII,and have it more or less work for English text.UTF-8 solves all of these problems and it's just a wonderful hack.It starts by just taking ASCII.If you have something under 128, that can just be expressed as 7 digits,you put down a zero, and then you put the same numbers that you would otherwise,so let's have that 'A' again\u2014there we go!That's still 'A.' That's still 65. That's still UTF-8-valid, and that's still ASCII-valid. Brilliant.OK. Now let's say we're going above that.Now you need something that's gonna work more or less for ASCII, or at least not break things,but still be understood.So what you do is you start by writing down \"110.\"This means this is the start of a new character, and this character is going to be 2 bytes long.Two ones, two bytes, a byte being 8 characters.And you say on this one, we're gonna start it with \"10,\" which means this is a continuation,and at all these blank spaces, of which you have 5 here and 6 here,you fill in the other numbers,and then when you calculate it, you just take off those headers,and it understands just  as being whatever number that turns out to be.That's probably somewhere in the hundreds.That'll do you for the first 4,096. What about above that?Well, above that you go \"1110,\" meaning there are three bytes in this\u2014three ones, three bytes\u2014with two continuation bytes.So now you have 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 16 spaces.You want to go above that? You can.This specification goes all the way to \"1111110x\" with this many continuation bytes after it.It's a neat hack that you can explain on the back of a napkin or a bit of paper.It's backwards-compatible. It avoids waste. At no point will it ever, ever, ever send 8 zeroes in a row,and, really, really crucially, the one that made it win over every other systemis that you can move backwards and forwards really easily.You do not have to have an index of where the character starts.If you are halfway through a string and you wanna go back one character,you just look for the previous header.And that's it, and that works,and, as of a few years ago, UTF-8 beat out ASCII and everything else as, for the first time,the dominant character encoding on the web.We don't have that mojibake that Japanese has.We have something that nearly works, and that is why it's the most beautiful hack that I can think ofthat is used around the world every second of every day.(BRADY HARAN)-We'd like to think Audible.com for their support of this Computerphile video,and, if you register with Audible and go to audible.com/computerphile,you can download a free audiobook.They've got a huge range of books at Audible.

I can remember being 14, 15and going on IRC which is like internet relay chatlike an old school chat service and irritating peopleIRC to this day remains a haven forthe kind of script kiddie type,the cracker type; the type thathas downloaded a few slightly dodgy scriptsoff the Internet and think they are now an extremelygood hacker because of itI may have irritated - like - 14 year old me may haveirritated people sometimesand...my home internet connection got denial of service.At that point my internet connection was a 56k modemIt is incredibly easy to Denial of Service Attack thoseParticularly if you happen to irritate someone who is onan enormous university connection, at say, ha, 1 meg.which isn't that much bigger by today's standards butin those days all it meant was they sent a little thing ontheir system, which sends as much traffic as possibleto your system.And if their system is bigger than yours, well...your internet connection gets saturated,you can't send anything in and out...At which point I have to literally hang up the phoneto dial in again and get a new IP addressso they can't find me.And, that was how it worked for awhile.Uh, and then you started to get the criminals involvedwho were writing botnets.Who were writing viruses that instead of destroying data,would go in and take over other people's internet connections.They would find broadband users, generally inThe United States or around there, who would...[exasperated exhale]Who would be running unsecured versions ofWindows XP or 98 or something like that...They would quietly install their software in the background,and then would use those unsuspecting users' internetconnections to launch a big denial of service attack.This was *distributed* denial of service so,Instead of having one big computer,you had lots of little computers,HundredsMaybe even thousandsMaybe tens of thousandsAll sending as much traffic as they couldagainst one company.And it didn't matter how big that company's internet connection was...Ultimately,ten thousand people all reloading their website orturning out as much traffic as possibleas fast as possibleYeah, it's gonna take down their network connection.And what was this used for? Well,Ransom..!What you found in sort of the 2000swas that gambling companies, finance companies,anyone whose job, whose livelihood, depended on beingup and online all the time, was being held for ransom.They would get a call, an email, or a messagethat said \"If you don't pay us -an amount-your website's gonna go down for quite a while.\"There are defense strategies, sort of...You can generally hire a very expensive companyto try and mitigate this, at which pointit does become a bit of a bit of a protection racket.But ultimately Microsoft got their act togetherThe number of zombie computers, as they were called,started falling down.And the internet started gettingmore and more and more and more bandwidth.And you could hire a net connection that couldstand up to reasonable denial of service attacks for not too much.Now the new threat is something called Amplified Denial of Service.And it's not a new threat as such,it's just a new common threat that's beentheorized about for a while.And what it is is a combination of a couple ofvulnerabilities in how some very old parts of the internet work.Hold that thought,because I need to explain something else first.I need to explain the difference between TCP and UDP.TCP is how most of the web works.It's how the webpage that you're viewing-the YouTube page you're viewing this in,gets sent back and forth.And it is a two way protocol,there's a handshake involved.You request something,and then that request is acknowledged,and you get something back and as all the packets goback and forth, there is two way conversation going onmaking sure that everything's arrivedin the right order, intact.Which means you can use it for webpages, and use it forfinancial transactions on your online bank.You can use it for anything where getting everything through*bit perfect* is required.And then on the other hand, you have UDP.UDP is very much opposite of that. UDP is...\"Here is a stream of data...just justdeal with itAs much as itas much of itas you canas fast as you canJustjustdeal with it!\"This is what you use for voice over IPThis is what you use for streaming video- live video.Anything where it doesn't matter if a bit of it gets lostOr a bit of it arrives in the wrong orderUhI say bitA part of itObviouslyBit... is a... thing with....Uh- it doesn't matter if some of it arrivesa little bit malformed, as long as most of it gets through.Now the difference between those is that UDPdoesn't really have a handshake.You just kind of point a fire hose of data of somethingand blast them with it.And because of that, well it meansyou don't really have to acknowledge itYou don't have to say\"Yes! I approve this stream being sent to me.\"It just kind of arrives and there's not much you can do about it...There is a flaw in the UDP protocol,or at least in some implementations of itand a few other subtle things around the internetthat means I can essentially spoof the return address.My computer here can claimthat I am someone else entirely.And that wouldn't normally be a problembecause most well-designed protocols-and pretty much everything in the internet-will only let you send on a small amount of data.I send a small request to themThey send a small request onwardsAnd it's not really a problem.ExceptThere is something called NTP,The Network Time Protocol.And this is the thing that keeps all the clocksin your phone and your laptop in sync toalmost to the milisecond.Wonderful thing, great boon to society, unfortunatelyhas a couple of really badly designed things in it.And one of them is this command: \"MONLIST\".This is the most useless, frustrating, and abusedcommand ever added to anything.Um- it's horrible.What is does is it sends the details of the last 600people who requested the time from that computerback.I have no idea why you'd have that...I have absolutely no idea why that exists.Why you would need the last 600 people-Why 600?!Anyway...What it means is that I can send a tiny request,just this little monlist command here,to the time server and the time servers are all on**Enormous connections**spoof where it came from,and they will send...AN ENORMOUSamount of data. 206 TIMESthe amount of data to that poor computer there.And more than that...You can work out where this is going, you knowThere are many time servers and lets say I haveone of those botnets that I mentioned earlier withzombie computersThose compromised computers all send small amountsof data to lots of time servers and they will all send206 TIMES THE AMOUNT OF DATA [furiously scribbling]to this poor sod.This is NTP amplification, but it's not the only amplification attack.There's been DNS for a while,there are a couple of others that security researchers are hinting at,but don't want to release the details of-Not because that'll stop the bad guys, it won't.You can't do security through obscurity, that's the term...But, you might at least slow them down a bit?..If you're watching this a few months afterit's been uploaded, I wouldn't be surprised if we've seenone, maybe two, terabit per second attacks.That is... a hundred thousand times more than your broadband connection?It's something that is on the scale of disrupting the entire Internet,rather than just disrupting one computer.How can you defend against it?Well... you can't.I mean you can hire a company that claims to be able to block a lot of attacks...And they can, and they can do interesting thingsat the network level to try and filter it all out...But ultimately, against an attack of that sizewhich could actually disrupt the infrastructure of the internet itself,there's not much a victim can do.But what you can do... is, campaign to get the relays,the amplification vectors to shut down.And we've seen this done before.We saw it with open mail replays, years ago.There used to be things called open mail relayswhich would be just simple sites that would take an email and forward it on.And those were incredible vectors for spam...And they were blocked, and they were filteredand they were shut down, campaigned against for a long, long time.And there's now a generally agreed upon list of thesestill open, which just won't be able to send anywhere,because everyone simply ignores their traffic.This is gonna happen, sooner or laterwith relays that still allow spoofing and relaysthat still allow amplification attacks.Sooner or later, they will get shut down...but... until then... well... you just kind of have to hope...that no one targets you.We would like to thank Audible.com for sponsoring this Computerphile video.And if you'd like to check out one of their huge range of books,get over to audible.com/computerphileand there's a chance to download one for free.I'd like to recommend a book today calledMakers, by Chris Anderson, which is all about the ideaof democratizing the world of making things andmanufacturing, so the idea is that the internet has ademocratized publishing and broadcasting with thingslike YouTube and then the same thing's happening tothe world of bits and stuff and it kind of covers a hackermovement so get over there, check that out...

   "title": "Secrets of the Deep Dark Web (Deep Dark Web Pt2) - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "22 Jun 2016",
   "transcription": "[Dr. Wilson] So let's now start talking about what is the deep web.Because your web server can say a few things.As well as saying \"here's your page\"it can also say \"I don't know what that page is.\"So if I say...Can we go to \"nottingham.ac.uk/freeStuffForMax\"?It goes: I'm sorry I don't know what that is.Page not found. We don't have \"free stuff for max\".It can also say you're not allowed togo there.So it can say if I want to go to\"nottingham.ac.uk/hr/increaseMySalary.html\"It will say \"sorry you can't go there\" that's a bit of the web you're not allowed to see andthat's really what the Deep Web is isbits of the web that google is not tosee or can't find or hasn't found and sothe easiest way of looking at the DeepWeb is it's just a huge portion of theweb which google doesn't have thepassword to go and see your hasn't comeacross yet or is sitting unconnected tothe rest of web somewherethere's four bitsof what makes the deep web or four niceexamples, let's say, of what makes theDeep Web different from the webone is that stuff behind passwords soany place that you go we have to type inthe password is a place that Google cancoax it doesn't have your password so itit can't look at your bank information, it can't look at your profile page on amazon.co.ukand in fact if you make your profile onfacebook not publicyou essentially pulled your profile onfacebook down into the deep web ratherthan having it on the surface bit of theweb and but all the normal pages likethe main page of facebook.com is onthe normal web the surface web that googlecan see it just simply can't get X itdoesn't have to probe the password thatyou havethere's also lots of dynamic content sothis is the second part content whichgets generated based on what you do orwhere you are is thatand so if you go on to amazon.co.ukand search for something Google hasn'tseen that search results because ithasn't typed in every single possibleword you could ever type into amazon searchso you see the products. It's found mostof the products, so it's indexed all thosepages because it has links to on thefront page of amazon but it hasn't seenall the dynamic things that you createbecause you typed in a word that it hadthought typing in and so this is dynamiccontent that it can't access and so yourfacebook feed is another type of dynamiccontent which is always changing and soit's A) it can't get there because it doesn't have thepassword and B) the last time i lookedit was different to the time you justlooked so hasn't seen itthere's also something called the robotexclusion standard which is a nice thingthat's most websites have a little filewhich is robots.txt on the server andthat says to google or other things arebrowsing automatically you can look atthose pages but please don't look atthose pages and Google simply justdoesn't look at them because it was asked not to.So there's large portions that thewebsite designers say please don't indexthis but you can look at that[Brady] Does that just rely on trust though[Dr Wilson] Yes. Yeah, so you could write a spider thatworks like Google spider which justignores robots.txt but you'd be somewhatbreaking the rules by doing that. Um...[Brady] Is that a legal thing, or just...?[Dr Wilson] I don't know is the fair answerIt could be... itcould just be a politeness thing just likemost standards on the internet.And so then the four type of stuffthat's in the Deep Web is just stuffthat nobody's ever linked to it, so it's neverbeen found as this google spiders havenever followed a link to find it andtherefore it's just it's there butGoogle hasn't seen it so it's not thatit's hard to access is just so deep thatnobody's found itso my laptop has a web server on it HTTPserver and so i can host web files on mylaptop and when I connected it to theInternetit got a unique address and so peoplecan type in that address and then see theweb pages that are on my laptop and sotechnically kind of anybody could dothat and then you just tell your friendsthe unique kind of code for how to getthere.Not the web link because you didn't createweb link maybe and your friends type inthe 1.128.193.274, go lookat your laptop and then never tellanybody else about it because yourlittle secret web page for you and yourfriends and so that's just a part of theweb that Google never came across and itwon't come across it until either youtell Google about it or someone links toit from another web page that Google's seen.And so all this is deep web stuff andwhich is perfectly normal stuff that Google just doesn't have access to orhasn't found and so that's the best wayto look at the Deep Web is just all theparts of the web that Google can't justwalk up and see, or hasn't come andvisited yet. So how big is the DeepWeb is an interesting questionGoogle's index for the normal web or surface web went past1 trillion pages not too long agothat was a kind of milestone it wentpastso Google knows about one trillion pagesbut latest estimates of the Deep Webthat it's ninety-five percent whereasthe five percent that google has seen isthere's one trillion pages so it's much muchbigger 500 times bigger and thatsort of makes sense because ninety fivepercent of facebook is stuff you look atafter you've logged in with yourpassword so and there's only a smallportion that Google can see which isbefore you log in and and there's wholewebsites which you just need a passwordto access forums or academic literatureor just huge resources of content thatgoogle doesn't go and seeand so it's very very big it's just notvery scary and not very unusualit's just behind passwords. So this takesus then towards the dark webbecause we now know what the internet isand the physical connections we got theweb is which is just software fortransferring information and we know theDeep Web is which is just the bits asthe web we have seen so what is the darkwebso the best way to look at the dark webis that it's just the web but builtdifferently so it's not surprisingreally and then the web was just somesoftware that someone built in thisdescribes how people share informationand so you could rebuild that and put itso saying get that page you could havebuilt it to say send me that pageyou know it's just asked a differentquestion use a different code speakingit's like a different language and sothere are several dark webs on theinternet they sit on the internet andoverlay the same internet like theweb doesthey just talk different languages theyhave secret handshakes and and theyencrypt things in different ways andthey store websites in different placesand you have to look at you have to gosomewhere else to find out where it isand so a good example of a dark web istour which is the onion where they callit then you go to . onion pages ratherthan . com pagesyou know it's just different languagedifferent codes and they the way youasked for a page is differently so everwhere you might have in to Chrome andsay I'd like to see that page abouthorses which is on the dark web and thedark web goes or would you can get pageabout horsesthat's not how we do things here so youkind of have to say the panda has orangeshoes and then suddenly gives you thatpage about horses that you wanted theinterest is just talking a differentlanguage is essentially transferringpages of information like the web doesyou just have to ask it the right way sodoes not mean that all the people who'vegot websites out there would have torebuild their website as an onion typewe're only if you want to be only on theonion whip and so you can be browsingthe interweb using Tor which is theonion browser and that we can lookperfectly well a normal web pages youcan go to Google on it but it also knowshow to or where to find out where theonion physical computers are and then itknows how to ask for it and and it's theother thing it does there was somethingis it sends you on a secret strange andunusual route through the internet toget thereso if you look at google.com on Tor butwhen i did this morning it was in Germanbecause the last place that I came outon the strange the route was in thecomputer somewhere in Germany and thisis sort of why they call it the onionweb because it has many layers that yougo throughso when it asks to view a web page itwraps up that request into severallayers of encryption and then send it tothe first computer which unlocks thefirst layer and says okay thanks now iknow where to go for the second one goesto a computer in Australia and saysunwrap the next layer and then it goesto a computer German accent and that oneasks my google have come to see it andthen it kind of gets wrapped back upagain comes all the way back to you andwhich is why they call it the onion andweb for the onion browserit sounds like a kind of huge game ofpass the parcel mixed in with one ofthose old nineteen eighties films wheresomebody's trying to trace thatcomplicated really clear phone call orsomethingI'm gonna bounce just call through ninedifferent relay stations throughout theworld and our two satellites thisdesigned to be more anonymous and moreprivate and what you're doing so it'salso a bit like a secret spy who's kindof got into a building suddenly andtaking off his coat and hat he's wearingan apron and then walks into the kitchenand seems perfectly normal in there andthen as you get out the back of thekitchen he takes off the apron is inoveralls and then suddenly drops downinto the sewer and he kind of goes alonga bit in there is a overall is lookinglike a sewer here and then pops up thetop takes off his overalls in a perfectsuit ready to go for a meeting somewhereto get a package and then has to do thereverse to get back inso it protects you and anonymity byencrypting everything and lots of layerssending in an unusual routes that youwould normally expect and then avoidsbeing sort of seen on themore servers and then on the way and bydoing thatso yeah so basically that's why I intoyour analogy that come interact withjust the normal world or you can talk tothe spies is that a good way of thinkingof ityeah it's it can do either the secretstuff that's on Tor. I can do the normalstuff that's on the normal web and sopeople have to say all the dark webthat's the place where bad things happenand that's not what it's designed forthe fact that it's anonymous means thatbad things can happen on it more easilybut you can do good things on it whenyou have more anonymity so it's slightlysafer perhaps to go and do your onlinebanking in a public cafeif you encrypted first and there is aHTTPS which is secure HTTP and that'sone way of making more secure but thenyou can also wrap it and onion layersand send often so suddenly you're sortof more safe in a public place and doingsomething that you want to do moreprivatelyso is it dangerous is a question of whatuse your anonymity for rather than thatit's specifically designed for dangerousthings because people anonymous they cando things which are less legal perhaps. Idon't know there's some known flaw ofthe onion web and there's ways oftracking what happens if you carefullysynchronize events that happened thedifferent stages and you can also if youview things like Flash over the Torbrowser that breaks all the ideas of itbecause it's this built-in different wayso when you login to tourists and to saydon't use Flash because that will giveaway your location but if you do thisnormal stuff that will be fine, and butthere are people who use it to put onpages so those things like the silkroadwhich is people knew about which is aplace where people could sell and buydrugs because and you were moreanonymous so that people could host thewebsite more honest me and all thepeople could go and visit in onanonymously. So it's illegal activitythat's been facilitated by anonymitythere's lots of positive things thatcould be facilitated by anonymity sopeople who are in an oppressive areascan browse the web or anonymouslythey can communicate with people morehonestly and so onso let's bring it all back together andtalk about the difference in the DeepWeb the dark web the web and so on soand the Deep Web was just an area whichis fairly normal of the web or justbehind passwords or does not found andthe dark web is a part of the deep workfor us it's a different copy of the webreally which specifically tries to hideitself was talking secret code iswearing camouflage and its hiding asmuch as it can be different and to be out ofthe way away from google and so thenjust makes it privateso the physical internet of computers iskind of physical connections orcomputers together that have IPaddresses each one of those physicalcomputers can have a web server on it sothat it can talk in software and shareinformation and pages and so this is thewebthe Deep Web is just part of it whichpeople can't get too easily and then thedark web is like a copy of the web thattalks in just the different waysdifferent languagesstart with the basics of the weaponinternet and because most people confusethose as well as confusing the Deep Webin the dark where and how the differentand we're just going to try and figureall that out today",

   "publishedAt": "15 May 2017",
   "transcription": "[Sean]: What steps have you taken to find out about this?[Mike]: I, I ran it. On my machine.Actually that's not quite true.I ran it on a virtual machine.So I installed a virtual XP machine, unpatched, from this current patchit wasn't connected to the internet, I downloadedthe WannaCry.exeand ran itand my files are encryptedand it popped up the warning message.[Sean]: This isn't something the peeps should try at home right?[Mike]: No I, I would advise against it right.So there isn't anything inherently scary about the softwarein the sense that if it's not connected to the net, it won't propagate.And if you don't have anything valuable on your machineyou aren't gonna lose any files.But on the other hand,I'm not running it hereon the university networkbecause I don't want to be the first person to introduce it to Nottingham (laughs)So, you know, just on the off chance, right?Let's not, let's not open that door.So where do we start on this mess?(laughs)[Sean]: What, what is it?Okay first of all, what's it called?[Mike]: So I called it WannaDecryptoror Wanna Cryptor[Sean]: So WannaCry WannaCryptor...?[Mike]: WannaCry WannaCryptor WannaDecryptor WannaDecryptor TwoAs far as I can tell, the source code has Wanna Decryptor in itA lot of people shortened this to WannaCryAnd there's a sort of WNCRY extension that it uses for its encrypted files...which are, which kinda spell WannaCry so yeah okayI'm calling it WannaCryptorbut I may not mention it by name againcause we all know what we're talking about.It's ransomware right?So ransomware is any trojan or worm or virusthat, in essence, encrypts your files and then try to charge you money to reverse that process.Without giving it too much credit, for obvious reasons,it's a fairly smart way of performing crime.because, if an antivirus is not immediately on the ball,then, the damage is already done.And a lot of the time, you won't get the key back unless you pay.And so you have to then either restore from backup,which a lot of people don't have,and... or you have to accept that your files are goneor you have to pay.And so, it's no surprise that the biggest stuff in the news recentlyin terms of attackshave been ransomware,because of the immediate impact it has on standard users.There are lots and lots of other kinds of malwaresyou know: banking fraud malware and key loggers and thingsand, bot net code, which is also a really big problembut perhaps it sees less newsbecause it doesn't attack the NHS.For those of you that don't live in England [UK really]you might, you know, not know a huge amount about the NHS.The National Health Services is our taxpayer funded health serviceright so we pay taxes, then those taxes contributed to health servicesand we all get healthcare.Perhaps we all need to calm the rhetoric down slightlyyou know, the NHS itself is not under attack,the nice thing for the media is ifis if you can have your headline say\"Attack on health service\"then you're gonna get a lot of hits.So that's the first thing thats happened.In fact, actually only a small subset of healthcare machines have been taken down by this ransomware,and a lot of it has been precautionary.So bring down the server, just on the off chance [the ransomware] gets it,until we can be sure, that nothing the same network has the trojan or the worm on it.So yeah, it's a big deal.And it's infected a lot of machines.But there are a lot of big ransomware out there, right?like Cryptowall had made millions of dollars for its developers, for exampleso, this isn't the only one, it's not the first, and regrettably, probably won't be the last.Let's talk a bit about what happened, alright?So on Friday,various machines started being infected by this.Now, the exact nature of the initial infection, I don't think is known right nowIt might be by the time this video goes out, right, somaybe I'll be out of date already, butprobably, emails, right?Which makes it essentially a trojan.Because an email goes out with a spear phising attack, or a phishing attackthat sort of says \"You should click this\" for whatever reasonsand tricks a user into doing it.Now you don't have to trick many users to get returns on your investment, in some sense,because once it got infected, that's a lot of money.This um, trojan, or this worm is a little bit unusual, in that it actually carries a self-replicating payload.Most ransomware doesn't do this.Most ransomware, the idea is to email as many people as possible,some of them, some small subset of them will be tricked into clicking it,they will be the ones you hope will pay the ransom.That's the logic of it.This one, uses an exploit that was first found by the NSA, an exploit of Windows.So this vulnerability has existed in Windows for quite a while,it existed in Windows XP, that was around in 2001 and so on.And it seems to have disappeared sometime around Windows 10, so it was patched in March,So, we don't know if...I think the vulnerability doesn't exist in Windows 10.[Sean]: So it's patched in March in Windows 7?[Mike]: Yes. So for any operating system that Microsoft is currently rolling out patches forwhich is to say Windows 7, I don't think Windows Vista anymore.There are plenty of copies of Windows rightly or wrongly that still have this vulnerability.Now this is a vulnerability in the SMB protocolwhich is mainly used for filesharing across networks.Very common, because you imagine large organisations like to share filesfrom a central server to all their smaller machinesrather than having everyone store all the files all the time.So, what happens when this worm lands?So this worm would start, with an email probably,or someone would deliver it by a USB, that seems less likely,but, probably an email.You only need one person on a network to click on it,and they get the ransomware, and then it starts to sniff out on port 445, for other unpatched installations.So this is a directed exploit, which would be able to run this same code, on the targeted machines,and then they spread and so on.And that's why it spread so quicklyThis vulnerability, which was discovered by the NSA, quite a while ago.5 or 6 years ago, we think. We don't know exactly because they don't tell us.And rather to tell Microsoft about this exploit, they decided to sit on it,with the idea, uh, with the idea that they can then use it in their own exploits.So their exploit kit became EternalBlue.That's the codename for this particular exploit.In some sense, no more was heard about it, right?For a while.It probably got used,by government agencies to perform their counter terrorism tasks and so on,until they were themselves, hacked, by another group,called the Shadow Brokerswho decided to try and sell some of these tools, and then just released it on the Internet.So Microsoft patched this vulnerability in March,and then in April, the Shadow Brokers released EternalBlue, the code of it, onto the net.It's only a matter of time before someone put this onto a self-replicating piece of ransomware.Because the quicker you do it, the more people who are still unpatched that you get and then damage ensues.The key difference, really, with this, from this ransomware, to the previous ransomware we've seenis the fact that it can self-propagateright?Sometimes these things get built into, uh, self-replicating programsbut, in this one, um, this EternalBlue exploit, essentially means that your machine, if it's not patched,you don't have to click yes, alright?Another machine will upload the payload to it, and it will run it, no questions asked.And it might, if you're running a server, which has shadow volume copies and things, and backups and restoresit might ask you for a yes-or-no response later in the processbut, a bit late, you know, after a lot of things have already been encrypted.So, most trojans, if you're very very vigilant about running email attachments, you'll never get thembecause you'd just see \"Oh it's a trojan\" or \"I don't wanna go to that website, it looks malicious\"And so you don't get them even if you don't have an antivirus.But if you haven't got this update, you can still get [the ransomware], despite the fact that you haven't done anything.Apart for perhaps being a bit lazy about your updates...Some time over the weekend, obviously lots of researchers are looking into this,not... um so I was looking into it and running it purely for interest, right, so I don't, umI'm not writing any tools to get rid of it or anything clever.But there are a lot of researchers, and what they'll do isthey will run this in a virtual machine or a special sort of sandbox where it is isolated, find out what it does,and try and work out how they can stop it,try and work out how they can take the role of the command and control server, for example,and tell it just to stop, or something like this.Now, a researcher, MalwareTech,whose blog is really interesting and we'll link to it in the bottom,they basically stumbled upon a killswitch for thisbecause they were looking at what it didand it polled this, it checked for the existence of this unregistered internet address.So it basically says, it did a DNS lookup and says \"Who is this? Who has got this internet address?\" and no one had it.So their first response was \"So if we registered that internet address,we'd then get communications from all the installations of this,and we could sort of track how many people have got this.It's interesting from a researcher's point of view, we can see how it's spread.\"But in fact, what actually happened within the code wasif this web address existed, [the ransomware] just stops running.The hypothesis is thatit's doing a kind of Volkswagen emissions situation,where it realises it's running in some kind of lab environment and shuts down.But, basically, as soon as they registered this web address,all future installations of WannaCryptor, WannaDecryptorshut down immediately upon starting up.Which obviously was quite a good news.So inadvertently they saved a lot of peoplea lot of time and effort, and maybe money.[Sean]: That isn't the end of this story, presumably...people have seen that that...[Mike]: Yeah...So there have been multiple versions of this with tweaked settingswhere they ba... probably remov...I think they've essentially tried to hex edit out the killswitch, and run it again.And yes, that's not unexpected, MalwareTech said this was gonna come,it's very uh... it's to be expected, becausethe code is not difficult to change to avoid the whole killswitch right?Obviously their attempt at circumventing some of these researchers' abilities has failedand it has inadvertently reduced the impact of the virus, or the worm.So, they'll just release it again.And they'll send out another huge bunch of emails.Now hopefully people are now aware that this exists and people are aggressively updating their systems,and it will have its impact.But some people are bound to get it again, I think China is being hit pretty hard todayit's going through China at the moment.So it tends to hit networks and spread about,until people realise what's going on and put a stop to it.Not everyone's got this, alright?I haven't got it.You haven't got it,no one in [University of] Nottingham, as far as we know, have got it.And that's because these SMB ports are blocked internally by our firewall.As they're coming in, they're blocked.So, you...an infected NHS machinecan't target a University of Nottingham computer,because the ports are blocked.Many of the networks that have been compromisedare networks where a machine inside the network has been compromisedand it's spread around the internals of the network.And the majority of ransomware is a trojanin the sense that it masquerades as something else,and appears on your computer usually through an email attachment.This one is both a trojan in that sense because that's probably what happened here,but it's also a worm, in the sense that it can propagate itself out using that exploit.So this EternalBlue exploit,already exists, and was known by the NSA for some time,it's already been patched, but a lot of people aren't,installing updates as vigorously as they should be,and also, Microsoft aren't routinely putting out updates for Windows XPso, anyone running Windows XP and/or now also Windows Vista and so onwon't have that updatebecause that's not what happens.Now in an unusual move, Microsoft has pushed an update for Windows XPbecause of the severity of this.But that's unusual.If you're running XP, the first thing you should do is turn off your machinebecause you've got no business running XP.But, you aren't gonna get many updatesbecause that's not what Microsoft are doing.[Sean]: This is like a car that nobody makes parts for anymore...[Mike]: It's exactly like that.In fact, a good analogy I think is...So people have been blaming Microsoft for this,there's a lot of blame to go around,Microsoft shares some of the blame,but, in some ways, what's happening is we're all driving around in 1940s Fords,and then when we have an accident we're complaining that the airbag didn't go offwell, there isn't an airbag IN those 1940s Fords, that's why, right?So unless you take it to the garage and have one installed, you know?It's that kind of principle, so.Yes, Microsoft wrote an operating system with a bug in, right?All operating systems have bugs in, all softwares have bugs in.They patched it quickly,they found it, they patched it in March, it's notin Windows 10 anyway,and they've aggressively put out patches for legacy operating systems to try and combat it.So they've at least taken all the steps they can,to solve this.The problem is that,big organisations like the NHS,have legacy softwares, let's say like drivers for scanners,and you know, MRI machines and so on,that maybe they bought 10, 20 years ago,that are still running XP because the software isn't compatible with the modern versions of Windows.That's a whole political issue that I don't, you know, that I don't have all the answers for.So the CIA leaks, a few months ago,showed that the CIA also has, this sort of, shall we saya back catalogue of exploits that they keep a hold of.So the NSA and the CIA will disclose some problems they find,but if they find a bug,a normal security researcher will privately disclose it to the companyfor them to release a patch,and then will publicise it later.Partly for the media purposes, and partly because then it encourages people to install the update.The NSA and other government agencies don't operate this policy all the time,because they view some of these exploits as useful for combating terrorism and other criminal activities.Now that may or may not be the case.But what's happening in this case,is, they've allowed themselves to be hacked,by another group,who has had no ethical concerns in just releasing all of it.So, this actually goes back to our end-to-end encryption talk,because what I said about introducing a backdoor,is introducing a very big point of failure,well that's exactly what happened here, alright?The NSA didn't tell anyone about this because they  felt they could privately use it for the good of their country,and that may have been the case.But it's not the case anymore, because someone hacked them and released it.So that's a huge problem when that sort of thing happens.So, there're already people, I mean Microsoft themselves in their blog,have mentioned this already,And Ross Anderson mentioned it in his blog,and we'll link both of those in the bottom,that,you know, you can't, they can't wipe their hands of this entirelythey can, you know, they can say \"Well we're doing this to counter terrorism.\"but in some ways, this is also their fault, because it was their exploit being used.The headline today all said it's a wakeup call.Really, people like Ross Anderson and other security experts have been saying this for years.This isn't the first time we've noticed that old machines are vulnerable to attacks.So yeah, maybe it's a wakeup call, but people need to be aggressively installing the latest operating systemsand updating.As far as I know, you can't turn off updates on Windows 10.And, that strikes me as quite a good idea,because people WILL turn them off.\"Ah I don't want it to update right now, I'll turn it off and I'll resume it later.\"And that's when they get hit by a piece of ransomware.So in the future,the robot chauffeur which will actually drive you to work while you're sitting there, hacking some code.And so, you've then got the technical problems and the business problems of how do you produce software upgrades...",

   "title": "Cracking Websites with Cross Site Scripting - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "23 Oct 2013",
   "transcription": "Cross site scripting is the number one vulnerability on the web today.If you are writing any kind of web software, and you don't know about this,you should know this!And if you are the kind of person who likes to play about with websites, and break them,in a definitely legal manner, you should know this.To explain it, we have to go back to the early days of the internet.We have to go back to Tim Berners-Lee sitting at CERN, making up how the web will work.The web is based on something called HTML, HyperText Markup Language.Most people who are watching this, I think, will know how this works,but just very quickly, it means that you have tags.An HTML document starts with angle brackets like this,and closes with angle brackets like this.Anything between angle brackets is read as an instruction.So if I wanna put some text in bold,I put a <b> tag and a close </b> tag, and I put some text in the middle, and that becomes bold.This is why, and I know you've been getting comments about this,the ending graphic on Computerphile should have a little slash like this one here,to make it over. Otherwise you're kind of saying that you're starting a new one.And, no doubt, all sorts of pedantic people have been emailing you about that.Those angle brackets, wherever they are in the document, mean \"an instruction is coming here.\"So, what do you do if you want to put an angle bracket, which is basically a less-than sign,into your document? Well, you do something called escaping.Instead of sending the angle bracket, you send an ampersand, and then \"lt\" for less than,and then a semicolon. And that means, when the user actually reads it, it will become an angle bracket.Great. Wonderful. And that works fine.It means in the old days of the world wide web, you could send a request,and the document would come back, and the angle brackets would not mess everything up.Then we move on a bit, and we start coming back with more interactive things.Someone comes along and invents JavaScript.And JavaScript is a programming language that sits in the middle of web pages.You start with a tag in the middle of your document. So you've already got your HTML here and here.You start with a <script> tag. And then everything stops.You've got a closing </script> tag down here. Nothing in this section will actually appear on the user's screen.What you have here is a completely separate programming language.You can declare variables. You can do calculations. That's vaguely sensible.You can create an entire language there, and that language can affect the document.So you can take the output from that, and you can put it into the rest of the text.So if you have, for example, an email client. Gmail uses this. Gmail uses incredible amounts of this.Because when you type in things, it sends it to the server.You don't have to send \"save\" like in the early days of the web.And then it would take a second to go there and a second to come back.It just quietly does it all in the background. It's really really powerful.It's the way that everything big, everything interactive, works on the web now.You can design entire games in JavaScript. And all it's doing is creating a web page,and then just moving bits about. The trouble is that JavaScript is dangerous.It can do anything to the web page. And rightly so - that's how Gmail works.But imagine if you could get whatever JavaScript you wanted to do anything with, say,the login page of an online bank. You could tell it that, instead of just taking the username and passwordand sending them to the bank's servers, first, it should send them to someone else.And when they've got them, and the user won't know that's happened, then it should log people into the bank.Or you could, say, instead of sending the words people are actually typing to the web,ignore them. Just send Rick Astley instead. This is how MySpace worms spread,because you would type in the code, and it would appear,because MySpace hadn't quite filtered JavaScript properly,and that's the cross site scripting bug I'll get to in a minute.You could write anything you wanted in there, and every time someone looked at that MySpace page,the code would run! And it would say, hey, go do stuff with their profile instead.And it would. JavaScript is dangerous because it lets you do anything on a web page.So, how do you get it in there?Let's go to, say, Google. Here's Google, here's a search bar.Whatever I type in that search bar, \"test\", will probably appear on the next page here: \"test\".And it'll also appear here a couple of times, and here.Whatever I type in here, appears on this web page. That's fine.What happens if, instead, I type in an italic tag?Well, what won't happen is that Google will send the whole page in italics.Because what they have done is they have converted it into this less-than. Which is great.Let's imagine that instead of typing \"test\", or instead of typing that,instead I type in <script> and then some code. And as long as I write valid code there,and as long as the box is big enough, and there's a few other hacks you can do to make that work,if, as a web developer, you forget to do that little trickthat changes them from less-than signs to that code that means \"put a less-than sign in there,\"your web server puts the page out, and the web browser looks at that and goes,\"That is JavaScript code! I'm gonna run that!\" And it does.And you can use that for entertainment. I have previously used that at least one place I shouldn't.And of course it doesn't do any lasting damage.All it does is, in that case, change a load of the words in the web site.It's only visible to the one person I've sent it to.Which is, you know, not technically entirely legal under the Computer Misuse Act, but no one pressed charges.All I'm doing there is playing about. But the more sinister stuff you can do with JavaScript,quietly stealing passwords and user information and letting you log in as other people,all of these things are entirely possible by just letting unescaped JavaScript get into your web page.And here's the thing. Here's the really important thing.All you need to do is mess up once, anywhere on your site,with any user input. Something that you think is completely innocuousbecause someone is just typing in their age.If you forget to escape that, and someone types in a little bit of code there instead,well, congratulations, your web site is now completely vulnerable.And this has happened regularly, in Google, in Facebook, in every single big site,because it's so easy to forget. Even when every single framework out there,every single tool to help web developers, has something that goes, \"Guys! You've missed this!\"\"You've missed this! Do you really mean to do that? Are you sure you really mean to do that?\"You can still mess it up. Even the big guys mess this up. And they have what are known as \"bug bounties.\"They will pay you money if you find something like this and then responsibly tell them.You don't go and tell the world. If you can do that, I think someone earned something like $12,000for finding a bug in Facebook that let people do this. So, rather than try and break things,try and mend them. Try and find something like this.If this is your thing, if this is your, something that you look at and go,\"Oh, I can try and break things with this!\", do it.And then look at the big guys, and try and earn some money with it instead.Cause they will thank you, they will put your name in lights on your site,on their site,and they will pay you money. Because the alternative is the bad guys getting this,and the next time you log in to Google, your password not going where it's supposed to.We'd like to thank audible.com for their support of this video.And if you'd like to download one of their vast range of audio books,you can go to audible.com/computerphile and get one for free.We always like to recommend a book that you could use for your freebie,and I asked Sean who makes our videos what he'd like to recommend,and today he's gone for \"Flat Earth News\" by Nick Davies, which is an excellent book, well worth a listen.So, audible.com/computerphile, check it out, get your free book, and thank you so much to themfor their support of our films.",

   "title": "The Most Difficult Program to Compute? - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "01 Jul 2014",
   "transcription": "So far we've looked at primitive recursion- things where you can use recursion ifyou want to, but you don't have tobecause it can be de-recursed and turned intoan iterative \"for\" loop.We did factorial and we did fibonacciboth of which are primitive recursive inthis sense.And there'll be a great danger in thinkingwell, surely,you can do anything then in \"for\" loops, whybother with recursion at all?Well, there are some things which are sofundamentally recursivethat you just have to do them recursively.It became clear to mathematicians reallyat the turn of the last centuryabout the nature of functions in general thatthere were some things that were so - ifyou like -  huge, so enormous, so badly behavedthat they just had to be recursively defined.And I think one the earliest people torealize this wasa research student of David Hilbert's -- nowwho is David Hilbert? We're back on Numberphileterritory again !Probably, perhaps, the greatestmathematician of the late 19th and early20th century.He was a phenomenal mathematicalgenius, capabilities, and so onHe was at Goettingen, in Germany, and I thinkI'm right in saying thatAckermann was one of his research studentsand it's WilhelmAckermann's function that we're going tolook at today.The test was, can you come up withsomething that just has to be donetotally recursively - you can't do it, as it were, in a \"for\" loopeven though those hadn't been properlyinvented at that stage.What became clear as a result ofwork started by Ackermann, and by others,is that we've got a hierarchy ofprogram types:Right down at the bottom - the simple ones we've seen --  the ones that can be de-recursed,these are Primitive Recursive. There's a wholelayer on top of thatwhere they're functions where you just haveto define themrecursively. Just above this set are theRecursively Enumerable functionsLet's be clear here, by saying PrimitiveRecursive at the bottomI'm including every other program thatisn't recursiveI'm regarding a thing that just goesthrough a sequence as being a verysimple example ofa primitive recursive program with noreal recursion in itand anything that's got \"for\" loopsor nested \"for\" loops,  well actuallyyou could have done that recursively, andprobably languages like Haskell dofor all I know.But they still count as the simplest form of program- primitive recursion if it's gotrecursion in there at allyou could always de-recurse it - make it into \"for\" loops, This next thingRecursive, on top of that, there's an evenmore problematical set of programs,above that, which says they're recursive,but for some values of the arguments youput into the functionthey will stop and give an answer and for othersthey will go on for ever and they willnever ever stop.[How do you define 'for ever' then, go on]Forever and ever and ever - they will gointo just repeating the same old stackframes and you may not be aware of itand just go round and round. And then you'll say: \"But how can I decide ahead of timefor given arguments, whether it will stopor won't ?\"And the answer is - Hello Alan Turing -in general that may well be Undecidable.So above here, out in hyperspace, is the Great Undecidable Universe.There are some problems you can set in computingthat just are not decidableat all - not by any algorithm and one of thegreat names in this was Kurt Godel -in the early nineteen thirties - and thesecond great name for computerscientists that linkedGodel's work with how computer programsworkedand with his Turing Machines, was AlanTuring. He wrotea famous paper in 1936 about his Turing Machines- referred back to Kurt Godel's work andbasically said\"There are some things in computingthat are undecidable\"  But for the moment were coming in here, at the next levelabove Primitive RecursiveWe're going and take a look at a Recursive function whereI can reason through with you that it will givean answer. It's not in the nasty set above it,the Recursively Enumerables, where sometimesit would go wrongand just end up spinning and not doinganything useful.This thing - and this is a goodintroduction as well to the way thattheoretical computer scientists- of which I'm not one - but I'll try and give you the flavour about how you can reason about programs,and how they behave, even withoutactually executing them.The version of Ackermann's function that tends to beused nowadays - the one modified by Peter and byRobinson:  here is where all the hard work occursThis is the recursive function itselfWe declare 'ack',for short, a function with two incominginteger arguments.And here, look, it delivers back an integerresultIt delivers back the integer result in itslocal variablewhich it declares for itself for holdingthe answer and eventually of course,look, it's going to returnthe answer. But how does it do itsrecursive horrors?If the incoming argument 'm' is 0then deliver back the integer answer 'm + 1'So if I came in with ackermann(0,2)because the 'm' is zero, it would deliver backtwo plus one : three. Easy. Otherwise if thatisn't true - if 'm' isn't zero, if it's any otherinteger, else if 'n' is 0then the answer is what you get bycalling up ackermann, recursively again,but this time by reducing the firstargument by one. Call upackermann with 'm - 1', not 'm', and withthe first argument 1. Otherwise - now that'sbad enough but here comes the realkiller - if 'm' isn't 0 and if'n' isn't 0, what's the general case? Thegeneral case isthat the answer is ackerman of 'm - 1'notice you're reducing 'm' again, look, andthis is where a headache starts toset in, this blows your brain and makes yourealize why you can'tde-recurse this into iteration - thesecond argument for that generalized callof ackermann, is itself a call ofackermann!  So you have to go through endlessthousands of stack frames to calculatejust what the second argument must beto another call of ackermann that's gonna gothrough the same agonyall over again. Now I think you canmentally visualize just what a hugeamount of computationmight be involved here and how bigthe numbers might get to be.  But what Iwould like to justdraw your attention to, because this isimportant,is that every time 'm' and 'n'are altered, in going round recursively, theyreduce. We found out that on the secondline it says if 'n' was zerothen it called up a thing with ackermann( n-1, ...)in ityeah, so you're reducing 'm' in that placeand even in the horrible worst case, thethird line,you reduce the first argument to 'm - 1'and within that vile second argumentit's ackerman(m, n-1)so as you go around this if 'm' and 'n'change at allthey are reduced. Thereforeif your first two traps,which we've got here, are for when 'm' gets down to zeroand when 'n' gets down to zero thenin the end it will terminate, so long asyou feed in positive integers for 'm' and'n'. Now, as ever, I have done noerror checking whatever - that's down to you.I want you to concentrate on this. Yeah, ifyou put negative numbers in there, boyare you in for a rough old ride !Yeah, it's got to bepositive integers, zeros are fine, but must be zero or positive integers.Although this is a huge recursive mess,with millions of stack frames, nonethelessby reasoning and saying that when thesevalues are altered theyalways alter downwards, you canconvince yourself that this willeventually deliver an answer.Now, the only trouble is that, in deliveringan answer, there may be a huge amount ofcomputation involvedparticularly when we get into this thirdline and you have to run Ackermann's functionin order to work out what an argumentto Ackermann's function is going to be.And just to show you how bad this getsI've set up two nested \"for\" loops on 'i' and 'j'taking 'i'from 0 through to 5 actually, because it's 'i' less than 6'j' from 0 through to 5,  and I call upthe Ackermann function as the argumentto be printedin the standard piece of text here.So you get things like ackermann(0,0)is whatever, and you call up ackermannrecursively, to work it out.[\"So, how's that going for you?\"]How is that going for me?!  Well, whatSteve and I(Dr Heartbleed as we now call him ....)We set this going four weeks agonearly, now.The first few have vanished off the top,You'll be delighted to know thatackermann(0,3) has a valueof 4, that ackermann(2,2) is 7ackermann(3,2) is 29 - doesn't look too bad.Now it did have a bit of a gasp for airbetween 4,0 which is13 and it finally decided that ackermann(4,1)was 65,533.It still took it, recursively,on this machine, 3 minutes to work outthat ackermann(4,1) was 65,533so this is progress, because this ofcourse is afairly modern quad-core Pentium, or whatever it is [Note: actually a Pentium 4] running Linux.The previous machine I had, when I firsttried this, seven or eight years ago,was a venerable Sun SparcBlade and theSparcBlade -miracle of its age - took 20 minutes to workthat out. So twenty minutes, threeminutes, we're progressing.And then, do you know, I was looking at thiswith Stevewe've set the thing going - it's still running. And I said: \"Oh!, y'know, it probablywon't be that bad, it'll be ...if it took three minutes to work outsomething whose answer was 65,533it'll take about, maybe, sixty fivethousandtimes three minutes to work the next one out and did a few calculations - yeah, aboutfour months on this machine.something like that\". Er, no!I've just looked into it more deeply andreminded myself of the appalling propertiesof the Ackermann function when it starts to build.No, it will take two to the powerof 65,533 -times three - three minutes per go.It will take threetimes two to the 65,533minutes, to work out that value.That is unimaginably huge!  It's nogood saying it's 'astronomical'- it's way beyond astronomical. The numberof particles I think including all darkmatter isn't more than about2 to the 300 - something like that - the number of seconds since the Big Bang is probably abouttwo to the 500 or 600 at most[Note: actually it's about 2 to the 59]not 2 to the power of 65,533.But what's gonna happen eventually - 2 to the power of 65,533is such a big number, so we're going to start getting wrong answers. We'll either getoverflow happening or perhaps if integeroverflow isn't signalled to us - you knowinteger numbers sometimes tend to rollover the top and gonegative. So who knows what will happen.I'll probably stop this off nowwhen we've made this video because franklyI have not - I don't think I'm going to survive for two to the power of 65,533 minutes- multiplied by three - for this tocome to an end.I think the astronomers would probablysay the Big Crunch, when the universe allgets down to a dot again, even that is probablygoing to happen in about another 2 to thepower few hundred ....This sort of  behaviour is often called'super exponential'.One of the ways of indicating that afunction probably has to be donerecursively and can't be done in \"for\" loopsis when it starts behaving super exponentiallyNot just like 'n' to the power 'n',which would be exponentialbut 'n' to the power of 'n' to the power of 'n'to the powerof 'n' to the power of 'n' - done 'n' timesAnd your brain just collapses and refuses to even contemplate what that means.In fact I've noticed one commenter - thankyou whoever it was -when somebody said: \"Surely you can doanything in \"for\" loops? What do you haveto dototally recursively?\"  Somebody has picked up oneof those numbers I don't know much aboutreally big ones called googles and googleplexes - they've day been covered in Numberphile -and saidHow about ackermann of g64, I think it's called [Note: g64 is actually Graham's Number]How about ackermann(g64,g64) ? The arguments before you ever start inflating themare still absolutely astronomical butthe really interesting thing is thatalthough we can never know what theanswer isand the answer two to the 65 thousand whateverdivided by three, that is going toinvolve 20,000decimal digits when it finally comes outway beyond the Big Crunch, butby reasoning with the program in the waywe did we knowit is not uncomputable. Think back tothe original hierarchy;because we can never know the answer tosome of these valuesdoes it mean it's uncomputable? No- 'uncomputable' means thereis no algorithm for doing it. Ackermann isa perfectly good algorithm!You can prove it terminates - it's just thatnone of us are going to be around long enoughto find out what some of those values are.",

I think James Grime talkedabout this a long long time ago on Numberphile. The last digit in a bar code or on acredit card is determined by all theother digits on it and if you change oneof those digitsthe last one changes as well so as youtyped into a computer- you can know instantly if you'vemissed a key somewhereso a hash algorithm is kind of like that- but for an entire file that might bemegabytes or gigabytes in sizewhat it gives you is a code 16 or 32 or64 characters generally hexadecimalbasically just one long number expressedin that way that is a \"sum up\" ofeverything that's in that fileIf you crushed it down if you do allthese manipulations to it and crush it downcrush it down and crush it down and what itcomes out with this thing that says this isa summary of that file you can nevermake it work backwards you can't pullthat data back out but it's like asignatureit's like a confirmation that this fileis really who it says it is the simplesthash algorithm I can think ofI would just be something like that'sfiveadd up all the digits in the filewhich is 4, 9, 14, 23 that's not a good hashalgorithm for a few reasonshash algorithms have three mainrequirements the first one is speedit's got to be reasonably fast it shouldbe able to churn through a big file in in asecond or two at mostbut it also shouldn't be too quick ifit's too quick it's easy to break andI'll explain that laterthe second requirement is that if youchange one byte one bit anywhere in thefile of the start of the middle at theend then the whole hash should becompletely different this is somethingcalled the avalanche effect. Ifyou're interested in how this isachieved do look up the actual algorithmsthemselves. It would take me anhour to explain vaguely how they workin a in a friendly way but if it's yourkind of thing do look it up but sufficeit to say one bit gets flipped anywherein the message then the whole hash iscompletely and utterly different thethird requirement is that you've got tobe able to avoid what are called hashcollisionsthis is where you have two documentswhich have the same hashobviously there is a mathematicalprinciple called the pigeonholeprinciple you have it if you have 50pigeons and 25 pigeonholes did you haveto stuff two pigeons into one of thepigeonholes that's a terrible analogywhen you say it like this but if I couldexplain itthere are incredible numbers ofdocuments out that possible with thehash meanwhile it's just one fairly longnumber that will be files out therewhich naturally have the same hash andthat's okay because the odds against itare so unlikely that we can deal withthat it's never going to happennaturallybut if you can artificially create ahash collisionif you can say create a file and changeyour namethen we have a problem and that's that'swhere security comes into these becauseif i can make a file that sums to acertain hashthen i can fake documents i can senddifferent things and have this signaturematchso let's say I have an importantdocument something that's i don't know, that'sthe \"permission to to go to the moon\" I don't know why I said that erm...oh yeah \"permission to go to the moon\"let's say that - and it's got someone's nameon itand that file is sent and along with itthrough other channels comes this hashto verify that this is actually thedocumentnow let's say I can intercept that fileand I can change it but because the hashalgorithm is broken i can change it andchange the name and change the data andchange whatever i can send someone elseto the moon because I can make thishash the same through carefully tweaking thebytesnow it's incredibly difficult to do thatin practice you'd want a massive file and alot of computer code but there are oldhash algorithms like md5 which was usedfor many many years which now have thesecollisions out in the wild andare considered broken because you can get afile not document with text in but acomputer code anything like that whereit's possible to send somethingmalicious and have it come out with thesame hashso this is important this is where speedcomes it if the hash is too slowno one will want to use it but if thehash is too fast if you can create newones in a few processor cycles then youcan fairly easily create documents thatmatch a particular hash. it is in a veryreal sense an arms race as I said formany years md5 was the acceptedalgorithm and it's still used for a fewthings but md5 is now thoroughlybroken because computers are fast enoughand there are a few -sort-of- interestingtricks you can use to try and createhash collisions deliberately. The otherproblem with md5 is because it was usedso much and it was used everywhere onthe webgoogle has become an exceptionally goodresource for breaking themYou wouldn't want to store apassword this way i'll talk about thatin a later videodon't use something like this forstoring passwords but people did manyfor many years people did & in a lot of casesa word will be stored next to its md5hash for some reason if you type an md5hash into google frequently the word itwas hashing comes out which means thatfor pretty much every word in theEnglish language and a lot of otherpasswords besides the md5 can be solvedby typing it into googleso md5 is is comprehensively,constantly broken so everyone move tosomething called sha-1 and now there arerumors that that might start to bebroken soon if it hasn't already becausecomputers keep getting faster hashcollisions are easier to generate soeveryone is moving to sha-2 which forthe time being is secure. sha-3 is going throughthe process of being ratified by allthe agencies now and in a few yearsthat'll be the standard - I meanultimately I should reallyemphasize this **Don't use this forstoring passwords** I'll talk about that ina later videothese are used for verifying files forverifying transmission and that's allthey should be usefulthere is one last thing which is thatoccasionally you will seedownload sites offering software who saythathere's the file we're going to send youand click here to download it and if youwant to be safehere's the hash of the file so you canbe sure it's the right one- that's a terrible idea I mean it willverify you've gotta download intact butthey're selling this as we guaranteethat this software is safe and you cancheck it against that hash - which isa bad idea because if someone has beenable to get into their website andchange the software they're sending itspretty trivial to change that hash as well sothey got that is hash algorithms that istaking a big chunk of data and turn itinto a small amount to verify it & in alater video i will talk about how that'sused and how that shouldn't be used foractually keeping things securethis episode of computer file wasbrought to you by audible.com and youcan go to audible.com / computerphileand download a free bookthey've got a huge range that you can listento on all kinds of devices your phone orin the car things like thatI was thinking about a book to recommendand it made me think about the firstaudio book I ever listened to and that wasTreasure Island and I listened to it on acassette next to my bed as i was goingto sleep each night I checked theaudible website they do have treasureislandso that's my recommendation today whydon't you check it outaudible.com/computerphile free book andthanks to them for supporting our videos",

   "title": "AI \"Stop Button\" Problem - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "03 Mar 2017",
   "transcription": "In almost any situation being given a new utility function,Is gonna rate very low on your current utility function.So that's a problem.if you want to build something that you can teach, that means you want to be able to change its utility function.And you don't want it to fight you.So this has been formalized, as this property that we want early AGI to have called 'corrigibility'That is to say it is open to be corrected.It understands that it's not complete, that the utility function that it's running is not the be all and end all.So let's say for example you've got your AGI. It's not a super intelligence, it's just you know, perhaps around human level intelligence.And it's in a robot in your lap.And you're testing it.But you... saw a Youtube video once that said maybe this is dangerous.So you thought, okay well we'll put a big red stop button next to it.This is the standard approach to safety with machines. Most robots in industry and elsewhere will havea big red stop button on them.Oh yeahHey.I happen to have a button, of appropriate type.soand we havewe have that.So right... there you go.Alright, so, soif only HAL would've been fitted with said stop button.Can't do that Dave, uh yes I can.except yeah, probably not.I know that you and Frank were planning to disconnect me.And I'm afraid that's something I cannot allow to happen.That was an incorrigible design.Is this the point we're making? Kind of.You've got your big stop button,because you want to be safe. You understand it's dangerous.And the idea is if the AI starts to do anythingthat maybe you don't want it to do,you'll smack the button, and if the button's like, mounted on its chest, something like that, ya know.So you create the thing, you set it up with a goal, and it's the same basic type of machine as the stamp collector, but less powerful.In the sense it has a goal, a thing that it's trying to maximize,and in this case, you know, it's in a little robot bodyso they can tootle around your lab and do things.So you, you want it to get you a cup of tea just as a test, right?So you set it up with this goal you manage to specify inthe bot's like in the AI's ontologywhat a cup of tea is and that youwant one to be in front of you.You switch it on and it looks around, gathersdata and it says oh yeah there's akitchen over there it's got a kettleand it's got teabags and this is likethe easiest way for me to fulfill thisgoal with the body i have now andeverything setup is to go over there andmake a cup of tea. So far we're doingvery well right. So it starts driving overbut then oh no you forgot it's bringyour adorable baby to the lab day orsomething and there's a kidin the way. Your utility function onlycares about tea right. So it's not goingto avoid hitting the baby. So you rushover there to hit the buttonobviously as you built it in and whathappens of course is that the robot willnot allow you to hit that button because itwants to get you a cup of tea and if youhit the button it won't get you any tea sothis is a bad outcome so it's going totry and prevent you in any way possiblefrom shutting it downthat's a problem plausibly it fights youoff crushes the baby and then carries onand makes you a cup of tea and the fact thatthis button is supposed to turn it offis not in your utility function that yougave it so obviously it's going to fightyouok that was a bad design right assumingyou're still working on the projectafter the terrible accident and you haveanother go try to improve things rightand rather than read any AI safetyresearch what you do is just come upwith the first thing that pops into yourhead and you sayok let's add in some reward for thebutton so that because what it's lookingat right now is it says button getshit i get 0 reward. Button doesn't gethit if I manage to stop them then I getthe cup of tea i get like maximum rewardif you give some sort of compensationfor the button being hit maybe it won'tmind you hitting the button. If you give itless reward for the button being hitthan for getting tea, it will still fight youcause it will go well I could get five rewardfor accepting your hitting the buttonbut I could get 10 for getting the teaso I'm still gonna fight you.The button being hit has to be just asgood as getting the tea so you give it thesame value right so so now you've got anew Version 2. You turn it onand what it does immediately is shutitself down because that's so muchquicker and easier than going andgetting the tea and gives exactly thesame rewardWhy would it not just immediately shutitself down? So you've accidentallymade like a dramatically suicidal robot.We're kind of back to the Three Laws ofRobotics again but could you presumablysay well the robot is not allowed to toshut itself down or something like that? Rightyeah so. It's still a reward if it doesso it's not gonna fire you but it's notallowed to do itself i'm guessing that'sa possibility. The robot cares aboutthings in the real world and the buttonwhether it's pushed or not has a bigeffect on the things that the robot caresabout which means that the robot caresabout the button so either it's tryingto stop you from pressing the button orit's trying to press the button. Eitherway that's not what you wantso suppose then you don't mount thebutton on its chest where it can hit itright. You put the button somewhere onlyyou can hit it somehow you managed tocompletely isolate the bot from thebutton. It's a fingerprint scanner or something?It's yeah it's something that it can't doitself right. It still either wants topress the buttonor wants the button not to be pressed but nowthe only path is through youso it's now incentivised to manipulateyou to deceive you to lie to you in someway either to cause you to not press it tocause you to press it if you somehowmanaged to persuade it it's not allowed tointeract with the button itself so inthe case where it wants the button notto be pressed it has a reason to deceiveyou so in this example it would steeraround the baby it would avoid the babyassuming it has basic level ofintelligence to know you don't want itto hit the baby and moreover if yourealize your mistake you will hit thebuttonshut it down and change it which itdoesn't want so it will behave as thoughthis is a there's a term which ilike to use here i'm not sure if Ishould just use it because it's my ownwhich is that it will Volkswagen you.That it will set itself up sothat it it behaves properly in thetesting environment despite the factthat it actually shouldn't pass thetest. You're testing it to see if itavoids running over babies. Soyou're trying to see does it care aboutharming humans but actually all itcares about is you not hitting thebutton and so then you might end up in asituation in which you become convincedthat the thing is perfectly safe becauseit keeps passing all of your moralpuzzles and test that you give it butactually it's just has enough of anunderstanding of your psychology to tellwhat it thinks you've put in and what itwants of what you want rather so it willfor as long as that button is able toshut it down it will continue to attemptto deceive you until it's in asituation in which it believes it can'tbe shut down and then you have a problemon the other side if you accidentallymake something that wants the button tobe hit but is unable to it is going totry and manipulate you into pressing thebutton so if you create your thing yousay okaymake me a cup of tea if the button ishit shut yourself downyou aren't allowed to shut yourself downyou aren't allowed to hit the button but ifthe button is hit the reward you get isjust as good at getting the tea so thatyou don't have a preference this machinereally wants to hit it's own button becausethat's as good as getting the tea sowhat it's likely to do probably is just take aswing at you or something justimmediately because if it can quicklypersuade you to hit the button ifscaring you into hitting the button iseasier than getting the tea it will justdo that instead which is a really kindof unexpected outcome that you've madethis thing with perfectly reasonablesounding rewards and what it doesimmediately is try to terrify youit reminds me of the proverbial carrotsand a stick this this is almost like thisis the stick and actually we need tofind what the carrot is would that be afair thing to sayyeah yeah you want it to actually wantit it's interesting because it hasto not care about whether the button ispressed right because it has to takeno steps to try and cause the button tobe pressed and take no steps to try andprevent the button from being pressedbut nonetheless really care that thebutton exists so one thing that youcan do something slightly more sensibleis you define the utility function suchthat the whole part of of what it'sreally trying to achieve in the worldand the part about paying attention tothe button being pressed and turningitself off and it sets it up so thatthose it adds an adjustment tab so thatthose are always exactly equal howeverhowever much value it would get fromeither it being pressed it not beingpressed it normalizes those so that it'salways completely indifferent to whetherthe button is being pressed. It just doesn'tcareso that way it will never try and hitthe button on its own it will never tryand prevent you from hitting the buttonthat's the idea that's a fairly sensibleapproach it has some of its own problemfeels like a really complicated thing toevaluate to be honestyeah firstly yeah it is kind of trickyand you have to get it right but that'salways the always part of this but onething that's interesting about that isthat it isn't what's called subagentstable so this is something that is adesirable property and it's part ofcorrigibility in fact which is thatthe if there's some property that theagent has you want it to if it makesany new agents that they will have thisproperty as well so you get some of thatfor nothing like in the same way thatyou don't want to take a pill that willmake you want to kill your kidsyou also don't want to make a clone ofyourself that wants to kill your kids right ifyou're making another instance ofyourself or you're creating some agentyou want it to want what you want thisis like the usual classic disney way outof a problem for a baddie character wherethey go I'm not allowed to do this but thatdoesn't mean I can't get this person todo this for meI need a young pair of legs and a strongback to go in after itexactly so in general when an AI designsits successor it will design it with the same utility function as it has forthe same reason but unlike with somesafety measures where the AI will beexplicitly motivated to remove thesafety measures if it can by making newagents which doesn't follow them in thiscase it doesn't care so you might thinkwell you're okay then it doesn't care itwon't remove the safety precautions butit also won't to put in any effort tokeep them so if it's making a newversion and it would take a couple ofextra seconds to put inoh and also respond appropriately to thebutton and it could do anything elsewith that time or those resources itjust won't do it because it looks at theutilities and says if the button is pressedi get x utility if the button isn'tpressed i get exactly the same utilitythis bit of code does nothing there's nopoint in it right this is going to beoptimizing itself or optimizing itssuccessor in a way thatyeah it think is beingstreamlining potentially but actuallyis missing the point of and that'skind of unavoidable if you give if youhave a situation in which it wants topreserve the button so that it can bepressed because it wants that then you'vemade something that wants the button tobe pressed and will try and manipulate you ifyou if you do it the other way you knowwhichever way you do it you haveproblemsanother thing that people have thoughtyou know as a suggestion of somethingyou might try in this situation is tojust have the robot have the AI not knowabout the button. Oh so keep it a secretright you have it hidden somewhere youknow the the machine is being observedfrom somewhere else and they have thebutton and it's outside of their controland they don't even know the button existsso they're not going to be motivated totry and deceive you because they're notaware that you have the capacity toshut them down and change them. There area few different variants of this butat the core of the problem there you'vegot the fact that you're building ageneral-purpose machine to learn andreason about the real world of uncertainabilitiesI suppose I mean even a very simpleoptimization systems consistentlysurprise people and so the idea that youcould reliably keep such a thing asecret indefinitely and it would neverput two and two together in fact whileyou're while you're improving it andtraining it's going to be learning abouthuman psychology because that'simportant for the final goal. It needs tounderstand humans in order to understandwhat humans want in order to do what humanswant so the idea that it's nevergoing to think oh interesting these guysyou know they don't seem to trust me i'maware there is this concept of an offbutton and it's weird that they haven'tgiven me one so maybe they have actuallyand just not told me about it that kindof hypothesis shouldn't take too long tooccur and of course if you've designedthe thing in an incorrigible way itwon't let you know that it's figured outthat you have an off button and will  justdeceive you as it always had so that's thekind of thing which is which could workbut it's not really a reliable solutionthe other thing that people sometimessuggest and this happens this happens inconversation sometimes is that peoplekeep applying patches you have a youhave a bad idea for a way to do this andthen somebody points out the way thatwould go wrong and then rather thanrealise the big core approach is flawedyou apply a patch you say oh well we'llalso add a negative term for doing thatand then also for doing that you knowThe spaghetti code ensues yeah yeah andwhat's more you're then in a situationin which you've got this system that youbelieve you've patched every possiblewayit's it's kind of um you haven't provedit's safe you've just proved that youcan't figure out how it's dangerous butwhat are the chances that you'vegenuinely thought of every possibilityideally we really want to be able toformally prove that the system has theseproperties you don't want a system inwhich you've blocked off loads ofspecific actions that the AI can doand you're just relying on it it'slike running a complicated search tryingto figure out a way to screw you overand you're pretty sure you've blockedoff all the angles. You've kind of failedbefore you've begun there that your codeis running this extensive search thatyou just hope fails and if it finds anyway to do it will jump on thatopportunityit's not it's not a good way of goingabout things the other point about thisis that the button is a toyproblem it's a simplification that'suseful for thought experiments becauseit lets you express your you know it lets youformalize things quite well you onlyhave two possible outcomes you hitthe button or you don't hit the button but infact with corrigibility what we want is amore complex range of behaviors wewant it to actually assist theprogrammers in its own developmentbecause if it has you know it has someunderstanding of its own operation youwant it to be able to actually point outyour mistakes to you or seek out newinformation perhaps if you say somethingambiguous rather than just assuming tosay well do you mean this or do youmean this or if you if you believe thatyou've been programmed poorly toactually draw the programmer's attention towhat may be the mistake rather than likequietly storing that away for any timethat they might try and press this button on youyou knowlikewise wanting to maintain and repairthe safety systems and so on these arethese are more complicated behaviours thanjust not stopping you from pressing thebutton and not trying to manipulate youinto not pressing the button so there aresome things that might work as solutionsfor this specific case but you wouldhope that a really good solution to theoff button problem would if you run it in a morecomplicated scenario also produce thesegood more complicated behaviours inthat situation so that's part of whythere are some things that maybe aresolutions to this problem but they'renot they're not they're only solutionsto this specific instance of the problemrather than the general issue we're tryingto deal with right now we have a fewdifferent proposals for ways to ways tocreate a AGI with these propertiesbut none of them are without problemsnone of them seems to perfectly solveall of these properties in a way that wecan be really confident of. So this isconsidered an open problem so I kind oflike this as a place to go from theprevious thing because it gives I thinkit gives people a feel for where we arethe types of problems that it seems likethe simplest thing in the world rightyou've got a robot with a buttonhow do you make it not stop you fromhitting the button but also not try andpersuade you to hit the buttonthat should be easy and doesn't seem like it isso utility function is what the AIcares about so the the stamp collectingdevice its utility function was just howmany stamps in a yearthis is kind of like its measure is ityeah it's what it it's the thing thatit's trying to optimize",

   "title": "Programming Loops vs Recursion - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "22 Sep 2017",
   "transcription": "[There's] a lot of interesting stuff both from thepoint of view of the content but alsothe historical context between, y' know\"When were `for' loops invented?\". Wellthat's what Algol called them but priorto that FORTRAN called them DO loops.And prior to that they existed in assembler.So, first of all, what's the history andwhat does it get you when you can doloops, but when do you run out of steam,even with loops, and you have to use thisshock! horror! Pure Mathematicians thing -that computer scientists have to learnabout - recursion?! It was a real cultureshock, it really was, in the roughly1940s, 1950s to suddenly findout that what the theoreticians had beendrivelling on about for years - about recursivefunctions in mathematics - actually was ofmassive, massive importance for computerscience. Back in the '40s and early'50s it was all Assembler - or aslightly dressed-up thing called a macroassembler, where you can have littleroutines full of, y' know, packagedassembler instructions which could becalled up, as and when needed. So, thatsort of served people for quite sometime. But probably one of the firsthigh-level languages to introduce loopswas good old FORTRAN [shows textbook]. Even though that was published in '65 Fortran itself goesback, I think, for almost ten years beforethat. It was invented by John Backus anda large team of people at IBM in the1950s. Many of you will know it. It's anexcellent language for engineering andscientific calculations. It is low level.I mean, when you look at the nature of aFORTRAN loop it's almost like doing itin assembler - but not quite. They didn'tcall them for loops - they called them DO loops.What I'm saying here is - you package all thisup - where you're sayingrepeat the following sequence ofinstructions, which I've done with mywavy lines here. Keep doing them untilyou hit the statement with a numericlabel on it of 180. The loop back fromthe statement labelled 180, back up tohere to increment the loop counter, whichyou're all familiar with in languageslike C. It wasn't done, as it wouldbe in C, by saying: \"Here's my block ofstuff to be repeated it's inside thesecurly braces\". Here you can see it's a lotmore like assembler, a lot more low-level.I mean there's nothing magic about \"180\"; it couldbe \"72\"; it depended on your labellingsystem. Implicitly here, in a simplething like this, you'd start off [with the counter] at one and every time I returned back here it wouldreset [the counter] to be 2, 3, 4 and so on up toand including 10. It's comforting forthose who were coming from assemblerinto a higher-level language to seesomething that was only slightly higherlevel, in sophistication, than assembler was.How did loops become more \"powerful\",if you like?Well, again, even in assembler and even inFORTRAN, there's no reason why youcouldn't have a loop within a loop. So Imight have, outside of all this code, yetanother layer of DO. What shall we say:\"DO 200 J = 1, 20\". So, there mightbe some more statements between 180 and200, who knows, but again, you see, anumeric label. And can see what'shappening is that for every setting of J,which will start at 1 and go up to 20,for every single one of those J settingsthe inner loop will be running throughthe complete spectrum of settings of Igoing from 1 to 10. So you will have 200locations [that] are being affected here.Basically going through the rows andcolumns of a matrix. All sorts ofcalculations in physics, chemistry andparticularly engineering just rely ontwo-dimensional arrays full of numbers- either integers or scientific numberswith a decimal point. and so on. Even hard-coreassembly programmers had to admit if you weredoing heavy scientific programming it wasnice to be a little bit more abstractand to have this sort of facilityavailable to you. Now you might say: \"Well,what came along to spoil the party then ?\"or \"How did people realize that this waswonderful but not quite enough?\" The compiler of course has got to betolerant and has got to be capable ofcompiling nested DO loops correctly buthow deep would it let you nest them?Well, I'm guessing, I would suspect thatthe early FORTRAN compilers probablywouldn't allow you to go more than about10 deep, maximum. And I think you and ISean have just been looking up what are thecurrent limits in C?  I seem to rememberthe earliest `gcc' was something like 32But Ithink we looked up this ... some C++nowadays allows you to do nested loops256 deep! And, of course, there aremulti-dimensional problems that mightactually need that, because it it doesn'ttake much knowledge of higher maths torealize if you've got a loop within a loopthe outer loop goes around n times; theinner loop is going around n times, youare then coping with an n-squaredproblem. If you put the third loop insidethe other two you're coping with a cubic,three-dimensional, problem. So what we'resaying is all these multi-dimensionalpolynomial-going-on-exponential problems,that come up quite naturally, you cancope with them in nested for-loops solong as they don't need to be more thanpower-32 or power-256 or whatever it is. And you think, well, that should be enough foranybody! There's these multi-dimensionalproblems you can just do them by nesting`for' loops and surely [a depth of] 256 isenough for anybody? What kind of problemwouldn't it be enough for? Well, a lot oftheoretical computer scientists of myknowledge amused me greatly when - those ofthem that will own up to this - back inthe 60s. People started going to lecturesfrom mathematicians, theoreticians, people concernedwith \"Godel Computability\" and so on. Andof course, those sort of people, were veryfamiliar indeed, at a mathematical level,with Ackermann's function. Now, as you know -you and I - we've done that one: >> Sean: Was that \"The most difficult ... ?\">> DFB:  \"The most difficult number to compute, question mark\"<Ackermann video insert>\"We set this going four weeks agonearly now the first few are vanished ...\"</Ackermann video insert>So what made it so difficult?well you write down Ackermann's function andit very clearly ends up with routinescalling themselves recursively in a veryvery complicated way. Now I think youraverage sort of engineer would be happyto say that there's this thing called `factorial'which is 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1,or whatever. And you could do that in aloop as well as doing this fancyrecursion thing, but a lot oftheoreticians admitted to me they saw aAckermann's function and said: \"I could try thatout in FORTRAN !\". Now what they perhapsdidn't realize - but it became famous by 1960 - is:FORTRAN is wonderful, but originalFORTRAN did not do user-level recursionYou could write a thing called ACK.You could actually get it to call itselfin FORTRAN. But you might have beenexpecting that every time it calleditself it would lay out a data area foreach recursive call they're called \"stackframes\" - we know that now. You get lots ofstack frames, one on top of another andas you come back through the recursionthey're deleted and thrown away and youclimb back into your main program.FORTRAN doesn't do that. It setsaside one stack frame. You keep callingyourself recursively it just tramplesin its muddy gumboots over all yourdata area and you end up with totalgarbage. It no more gives you values of theAckermann function than fly to the moon!And people said: \"I then realized theimportance of having user-levelrecursion, in programming languages, tocope with those really hard problemsthat fell outside nested for-loops\".Algol was famous in that its routinescould call themselves recursively andcould get the right answer and, forlimited low-order values of Ackermann'sfunction - very slow, very slow indeed - butit would come out with the right answer.>> Sean: Is there any need to think of an example of aproblem, or program, because Ackermannfeels to me like it's the test-bed.You know, when you're testing out amotor-car you might take it on the trackand see how fast it can go.But in day-to-day life that car mightonly get half that speed. What's thereal-world kind of equivalent? Is theresuch a thing?>> DFB: Real world equivalent?>> Sean: ... of something that might need to userecursion ... ?>> DFB: ... of that complexity? Not many thingsis the answer to that. I mean, yes, it'strue that Ackermann, as you know, was DavidHilbert's research student. And thechallenge was on to find something thatwas so innately recursive that - rememberit was \"generally recursive\", they called it -as opposed to \"primitive recursive\". Andsimple things like factorial and indeedindeed Fibonacci, are primitive recursive.So I think you're right that you reallyare just making the point thateventually there are things that willkill you. I think the question in themiddle is: \"Is there something out there -pieces of program you need to write -where non-trivial recursion, in a sense,is needed but not quite to thehorrendous degree that Ackermann did. And theanswer is:  \"Yes, compilers is where it hitpeople\".  Because although early FORTRANdid not provide user-level recursion, foryou and me, nevertheless John Backus andhis team implemented it in the middle1950s I think at IBM.And Backus wrote articles afterwardsbasically saying: \"We didn't know enoughabout recursion and even though wedidn't provide it for the users of ourlanguage, boy did we need it in thecompiler! Andwe ended up inventing it in all but name\"The syntactic structures of what islegal, in a language, even at the leveljust of arithmetic statements can bequite recursive. Because you end up withbrackets within brackets within bracketsall with a multiplier outside. And whichorder do you do the brackets in? And, youknow, how how many levels of bracketnesting can you have. And if you don'tget things sorted out correctly thenyou'll get the wrong answer. But once againthe problem could be that your userswould come up to you and present youwith a problem just designed to test outyour compiler, and whether it was robustenough to be able to cope with a highdegree of nesting even just inarithmetic statements. So by 1960 inAlgol, yeah, the there were enough users, atthe user level, who could see that amodicum of recursion, perhaps morecomplicated than factorial but not quiteup to full Ackermann capabilities would bevery nice indeed to have within your language. <trailer for EXTRA BITS video>Again referring back to thatoriginal video, I had a lot of reallyinteresting mail from various people whosaid to me: \"OK, you said that this is aninnately recursive problem and it justhad to have general recursion capabilities? Well I .... \"</end of trailer>",

   "title": "Turing's Enigma Problem (Part 1) - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "28 Nov 2014",
   "transcription": "A movie has just come out called \"The Imitation Game\"starring Benedict Cumberbatch as AlanTuring andKeira Knightley as one of the the team that worked with Turing -  her name was Joan Clarke.[ALAN TURING: ... five minutes and 34 seconds ...][JOAN CLARKE: ... you said to do it in under six ...]And I'm sure many of you knowAlan Turing worked at the Government Codeand Cypher Centre at Bletchley Parkthroughout the war, right from when itbroke out in 1939right through until the end the war in 1945.Alan Turing was at Princeton doingresearch with anothervery famous mathematical logician calledAlonzo Church.He returned from Princeton in 1938 buteven in that year,from '38 to '39, it's very clearthat he was contacted by GC & CSeven though he wasn't employed by them.And became a sort ofconsultant; became acquainted with allthe difficulties that were going tohit the Allies when war broke out- as seemed inevitable - in deciphering Germanciphers that had been done on this Enigmamachine. Now an awful lot of the materialthat I'm going to be using today, really,uses as a reference bookthis one by Andrew Hodges. It's called \"Alan Turing - the enigma\"This has been reprinted, republished - Ithink in a slightly newer edition -because \"The Imitation Game\" is basedon this account of Turing's life.Now, Enigma goes back a long way.Prior to its use by the German armedforces it was just a simple commercialcipher machine and it was a prettyreasonable systembut I suppose you could say the number ofpossibilities - thedegree to which it scrambled up themessage, was considerablebut not ultra, ultra safe,I think it was a machine that - as theysay in the cryptological trade -was designed to discourage casual snoopingrather than to withstand seriousattention from experts in the field.And what I want to do is to go throughwith you, in this video,the components of the system and then inthe later onesummarise and say: \"That's the problemthey were up against -how do you make a machine that couldhelp you decipherthat code if you didn't know the settingsof the machines that created itin the first place?\" I'm going to cross-referyou to some footage on our sister channel,Numberphile. James Grime has done a coupleof videos,on Numberphile, which actually usea real-live Enigma machine thatbelongs to Simon Singh.Lucky James gets to use the real thingand I would strongly recommend,if you're puzzled by all of this, go and watch those two videos.One of them is just a generalized introductionto the Enigma, the other one explains precisely whythe Enigma machine's big flaw was that itcould never enciphera letter as itself. Believe it ornot that is a big, big security flaw,and does provide a way in, for people whowant to crack that particular code.The Enigma itself looks, at first sight, a bitlike an ordinary typewriter. It's got a typewriterboard layout, there's typewriter keys,but you then notice that if you switch it on - andit is battery powered -in the area just above the keys, instead of having26 further keys, you have 26places where a lamp can light up a letter.So you might press a T and it will light up as a G.What else is there, inside this machine. Howdoes the key-pressget through to illuminating a lamp? Wellin the most amazing and convoluted way.There's a set of rotors here. Theserotors have 26 alphabetic lettersengraved around the circumference.Sometimes you don't get letters youget numbers 0, 1, ... through to 26, but it comes down to the same thing in the end.When the lid is closed on top of themthe letter - as it were - pointingupwards on the rotoranywhere between A to Z, shows up inthree identicallooking windows. Perhaps the easiest wayto think of it - evenfor those of you viewing who are relatively young - can you remember back to your family's firstever car?Where it had an old-fashionedodometer, you know, a mileage indicatoron the dashboardwhich wasn't all done in electronics, itwas actually driven off the engineand you actually had little wheelsmoving in front of you?On the right-hand side would be the tenthsof a mile, or tenths of akilometre, and every time that had got up to a 9 it would nudgethe dial to the left of it, to move on oneplace, and so on.The principle is exactly the same on the Enigma.The right-hand rotor moves the fastestand at a certain stage will nudge thenext oneinto moving on a notch. The left handrotor is the slowest moving of alland once the lid is closed on the Enigma, allyou see is theletter on the rotor that's uppermostshowing through the windowsat the top. Now - complication upon complication,Within each rotor there is, if you like,on the two sides, an input stud andan output stud,and they are cross-wired. If you could break openas is shown here, the rotor mechanism,you would see a whole bunch of 26 wires, in there,which are cross-wiring an input studto an output stud. So you might get A, cross wiredto J, B cross-wired to Q,C cross-wired to W - something like that.When Enigma first came out therewere three sorts of rotor wheelnumbered I, II, and III, in Romannumerals, typically,in the German instruction manuals. A rotor of typeII would not be cross-wired in the same wayas a rotor of type I. And similarlya rotor of type III would be a completelydifferent cross-wiring.I think many of you will know the number of waysyou can arrange three things on aspindle like thatis 3 factorial, which is 6.  Six possible orderings of the rotors on the spindle.So you can begin to see the multiplication of the number of combinationsabout how this thing could be setup in the first place.You've got different orderings on the spindle;you've got different cross-wirings on thedifferent sorts of rotors.So for the very basic machine, then, thatwas just about it. You fed thesignals through the right-most rotorthrough the middle rotor with a differentcross-wiring and mapping, through theleft-hand rotorand then there was what the Germans calleda 'reverser',sometimes in English called the 'reflector'.What it would dowas to return the signal back via a differentstud on the left-hand rotor so it would take adifferentjourney back through the machine to theway it came in.Now here is the secret of whyit never mapped a letter to itself. Itcouldn't because,to make that effect happen, you'd have hadin the reflector drum here,to say \"Ah! it's coming out of the A slot;I'm going to return it backthrough the A slot\". It wasn't electricallyset up toenable you to do that. You effectively hadto decideto cross-wire in that reflectorto something different. And I think, here,if you look carefullyA is actually cross-wired to something like W.Now, in the early 3-rotor Enigma, thatreflector had fixed cross-wiringswhich were the same in all Enigma machines.So, your current goes back through a different routeand then, finally, lights up a lampon the lamp arrayjust ahead on the keyboard. over here  So that's the way it was up until about the mid-thirties.But then, as the German armed forces weretaking more and more interestin these things, and saying: \"Oh, if we could beefthem up these could be made intomilitary grade security devices\",they did two things. First thing, they saidwe're not just going to have three rotors insix combinations, we're  going to do thefollowing: were going to invent two more rotorscalled IV and V, amazingly :-) Here's what you now do:We will choose any three out of those five rotors- well the ways of picking three from five isfive times four over one times twoFive factorial over three factorial [times two factorial]The answer's 10.But for each of those 10 ways, you can stilljumble them up in six ways on the spindle.Ten times six is sixty, so classicArmy-Airforce Enigmaused this pretty well throughout the war.You chose three from fiveand the three you chose could be put on the spindlein a certain way. Now comes the real killer.If that wasn't bad enough, the armed forces decidedthat on the input to the machine and on the outputthey would have another cross-wiringboard, called the Plugboard.Now this one's simple to understand. It'sbasically got socketsnumbered from A to Z and you're givenchunks of wire.If the instructions say crosslink Ato J, that's what you did. Crosslink Bto R, you did that as well. In usual operating practice10 out of 13 of those plugswould be cross-wired and wired up. You couldwire up in the pairs but you didn'tabsolutely have to wire up everything. Ifyou left somethingunwired - or 'unsteckered' as they would say in German -then that's fine. I mean a letter Q might haveno plug in it - going absolutely nowhere.Fine. So Q maps to Q - it's not alteredto anything else at all.But, like I said, typically 10 out of 13would be wired up.So this is getting to be a prettycomplex machine nowand you would think: \"By golly! surely thisis enough security for anybody?\"Well, what's good enoughfor the Army and the Air Force in almostany armed forces in the worldis never good enough for the Navy! I thinkit's that case in the UK - it's certainly thatway in the US,and it certainly was that way in Germany.AdmiralKarl Doenitz who was the headof the German Navy, was a very smart guy. Somepeople theorize - and maybe they're right -that he strongly suspectedas the war went on, that maybe Army andAirforce Enigma was beingdecrypted successfully, sometimes, by theAllies, and he was determinedto make the German Navy version of Enigma far harder.So, first thing he did was to say: \"All right,we'll stick with three rotors for the momentbut it isn't choose 3 from 5, it's choose3 from 8\", And and by the time you've worked itout, how many ways to pick 3 from 8,and then multiply by 6 for the numberof ways you can arrange the three you've chosen on the spindle,the answer is 336.And that's daunting! One of the things, I think,does need a bit of careful explanation -it's not very well donein the various books about Bletchley Parkand Enigma, and how it worked -is to explain what these so-called 'ringsettings' were.Now the straightforward, internal, cross-wiring is simple:you just look at the top row and for everyletter you followvertically downwards and you say: \"Okay, ina Type I rotorA on one side gets mapped toE on the opposite side. B gets mapped to K;C gets mapped to M - all the way through to Z gets mapped to J \". But to complicate matters just a little bit furtherevery one of these rotor rings had alittle blob of paint associated withit showingwhich was the proper setting. with A atthe top and A against the dot ofpaint, but it had the ability tobe able to turn the thing in such waythat instead of A being against the canonical blobsomething else was So, so you couldset a little notch that held it in position,but in a place that actually was notthe standard position.If you put your button - your ring-settingbutton - against the letter Bit had the effect of making A map acrossto whatB would normally have turned into. B would normally have turned into K.B goes to M; C goes to F; D goes to L and so on.It's just an offsetting mechanism.It's just moving, as it were, the bunch ofwires insidethe rotor. So, that is what a 'ring setting' is.It's basically an initial offset, thatchanges the mapping ever so subtly -makes things even more complicated. The  finalbit of complication now, just so that we'recompletely mind-blown andthink: \"How on earth could this ever be decryptedby anybody?\"You might think that just as a car's odometerwould go all the way up to 9, on theright-hand side and the moment itturns over at 9 it would nudge thenext one on the left, some bright sparkhad the idea that it might give more securityif you made different wheel types havedifferent turnover points.And Doenitz's extra rotors VI, VII and VIII -even worse - they turn over twice!Once at Z, and once at M - in the middle ofthe alphabet.Actually it's not a good idea if youthink about it.And I'll tell you why. Imagine you know -because you've done a lot of work on this - you're prettysure that at the momentthe machine has got a Type I rotor at the right.And you're also pretty sure from thecryptanalytical workingdone, that it's currently on the letter N.You then type in three more of thereceived ciphertext letters.  And yousuddenly see - you suddenly find things going completely weird.This isn't just the same wheelturning, something's happening,It shouldn't have come out looking like this - this sequence! Argh! it's turned over the middle rotor, so if Ithink it was on N andit's turned over the middle rotor on a Q,then it follows that that right-handrotor must be of Type Iand I wanted to know that all along. Sothese turnover points, because they weren'tall at Z to A, which would havemade it all look uniform,you know, whenever anything turns overthat's the way it does it,had this little signature that if you're verycareful in your cryptanalysis gives the game away.How is this all gathered together? Ifyou were very lucky, in the very early daysof the war,you didn't even have to try and cryptanalysethis incoming ciphertext traffic -either by hand or by machine. If youcould do what Bletchley Park called'a pinch', If you could actually get a secret agentor an army officerto just accidentally be able to get holdof the code tables,issued to the German armed forces, youdidn't have to do any cryptanalysis at alleither by hand or by using this veryexpensive machinery that we'll be talkingabout next time,this electro-mecanical Bombe. You didn't have to use thoseit's all here. But as James makes very clearin his videosIf you did get that bit of luck it neverlasted long;you maybe got a month's worth and then ait ran out, orsomeone back at headquarters said: \"I'm not happy, one of our code books seems to have beenstolen and disappeared.I'll tell you what, even though there's six months to go on it, we're throwning it away andissuing another one -just to be on the safe side\". We've assumed and it's quite rightthat the good thing about Enigmafrom the cryptanalysis point of viewit started off life as a commercially available totally open machine soyou might think: \"Well the wiring inside thoserotors then -three of the rotors at least, I, II and III -would be known?\"Yes, but of course the moment the Luftwaffe and the Army startedintroducing two more rotors you've then gotthe problemof \"Can we steal these things or do wehave to work out from first principles,and with rather a lot of advanced GroupTheory and mathematics, and a lot of knownciphertext and plaintext, and all sorts - can we work out what the wiring isin those rotors without actually havingthem?\" And the answer is,eventually, \"Yes\", but it's very very niceif somebody helps you on this front.What did you needto know in order to decrypt a cipher streamdone within Enigma, that your listeningstations had picked up ?.It was transmitted in Morse as single letterssent to Bletchley Park - what do you need toknow to make any sense of this?Number 1:  which rotor wheels are in use?Number 2: what is the ordering,left to right, of those rotor wheels ?Number 3:for each of those rotor wheels where hasthat studbeen located that does the ringsetting - against which letter ? The fourth thing, which we haven't mentioned very much, but whichin the next video we'll say a lot aboutthe operator himself - usually himselfnot herself - had to also do what was called a 'message setting'.for this particular message. Everyseparate message had to have a differentmessage setting.It wouldn't have been safe just to keepusing the ring settings alonewithout any alteration to those. Sothat had to be worked out as well.And finally - last but not least - the plugboard cross-connections had to be worked out.Now that's a lot of stuff. In the veryearly days of simple Enigma,where therw were only three rotors, notchosen from anything else,just three, we'll find out next time thatthe Polish Cipher Bureau had a lot of successby hand, and with a very simple machine, ingetting things decrypted. But themoment you start adding more rotors,plugboard and all the complications yourapidly findthe you just don't have enough time inthe day to decrypt all that you'd like to do.The sheer weight of cipher traffic takes over.You have to mechanise.",

   "title": "Onion Routing - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "31 May 2017",
   "transcription": "Let's talk a bit about anonymization, more specifically onion routing, so Max has done a very good video on the Dark webAnd the deep web and the service web and the differences between them when people talk about the dark webThey're mostly talking about Tor and specifically Tor hidden services. Now I'm not talking about that certainly todayI might do that in a different videoTor literally stands for the onion router, right, it is an implementation of onion routing right which was developed in the mid 90s byUS Naval research.The idea isIt bounces around connections between different routers so that they're hard to track and it's and it provides anonymitySo this is different from confidentiality which we usually associate with encryption right most of the time, we're encrypting messagesSo that even if people see that we've sent a messageWe, they can't read what it is like, but sometimes we don't even want people to see that we sent a message at allSo what I'd like to do is focus on onion routing specifically bearing in mind, that Tor is a and implementation of itso in some senseI'm also talking about Tor, okayAnd maybe we'll focus a little bit more on what it is that Tor does differently a bit later.So this is me and which is my very well drawn computer as always and I want to talk to a server hereWhich doesn't have a monitor because in my view servers don't have monitors, so normally on this client server setupI want to talk to a server, but in this caseI don't want anyone to know that I'm talking to a server at allI'd like to be remain completely anonymous, right, now if I then go onto the server and log on obviously that's not anonymous anymoreRight so it's limits to thisbut this is the idea, now how this works is I'm going to bounce my connection around andThen it's going to go to the server and if in essence the last node on the hop, the last hop on the network isIs going to be the one actually visits that website on my behalf a bit like a proxy we're going to use multiple levels of encryptionto try andEssentially confuse people who are trying to work out what's going on right now Tor in it inIn its implementation uses three hops three intermediate nodes, so I'm going to limit: oneThat's not a very good computerTwo. Hang on I thought servers didn't have monitors. Oh no, so well. Aw, don't. I meanyeah, so that's a good question right so you can run Tor and you can be an onion router on a client machine on aLaptop you know it doesn't really matter if your net connection is quite goodyou can do it. The software is free and theyVery much want people to sign up and become these intermediate nodes because in some ways that's what the power tor iswe'll get to that a little bit butin essence what happens here is I send a message toTo this guy he forwarded on to this one he falls it on to this one who then forwards onto the server when a serverResponds they simply pass the messages back now this haven't really solved any problems yetBecause anyone sniffing here will know well ok we just need to sniff there and then  sniff there.and they can kind of reassemble the communicationIt makes it a bit of a pain, but it doesn't stop anyone from finding out: What's going on?I, even if these were encrypted so what we need to do is have multiple layers of encryptionWhat's clever about onion routing, Is that no one in this network knows anything about the whole connection.They just know what's before them, and what's after them. Alright?so let me show you how this works so  I'm going to use different colored pen alright, so let's use this red pen.Let's imagine for a minute that I've established some shared symmetric keys with these three nodes here, right?So just like in previous videos where we talked about encryptionWe're talking about let's say an AES keyAnd I have one shared with this guy and one shared with him and one shared with this guy no one else knows what they are.like because I used a key exchange to do this, so I had K1 K2 and K3and this router knows K1 this router knows K2, and this router knows catering now that might seem implausibleBut actually that's quite easy to set up using modern key exchange right Diffie\u2013Hellman for example performance is quite wellIf I encrypt something with K1 only this routerCan see it all right and if I could encrypt some of K3 only this router can see it right there is noEncryption with the server at the Moment. Now onion RoutingEssentially sends messages, encrypted multiple times with different keys in layers, so this message hereis encrypted three times, rightSo this is where we sort of fast forward as I draw a bunch of lines onBut we're going to say this [risk route] message here encrypted once with K3. It's encrypted another time with K2And when it's encrypted a final timeWith K1 now let's think about what that meansit means that onlyThis router hereCould unlock the first layer. That's the first thing it means it also means that when it's done that it'sGot a totally garbled message, but because it's still encrypted twice already right, so it's gibberish it can't possibly know what's going onBut what it can do is forward that message on to k2 so k2 takes a message,Which is encrypted by k3 and then again encrypted by k2 and it can strip off a layer as wellBut again, it then looks at the messageAnd it doesn't make any sense because it's still encrypted by k3 so it forwarded on to this routerEncrypted by K3 finally K3Decrypts this message looks at itAnd it does make sense because it's not encrypted anymore, and it and it says the message says I'd like to go to Facebook please,and it goes I can do that and it connects to Facebook and receives a response now on the way backthe exact reverse process happens.This router will add its encryption of k3 and forward the message onto router 2 - who will add K2Route 1 adds k1 and only we can decrypt the whole message because we have all the keysWhat's really interesting is the property that this gives us, the first thing is that k 2 doesn't need to know anything,except the address of K1 and the address of k3 it doesn't need to know who I am right it receives a message fromK1 and all it knows based on the protocol is this is a message that needs to be forwarded to k3After I've removed my layer of encryptionThat's all it knows when it receives a message from k3 it adds its encryptionAnd then passed it straight out the other door to router 1 so if this was compromised by an attackerThey've learnt nothing right. They've learned that two of these guys and running Tor nodes or onion routing nodesThey haven't learned who I am they haven't learned who the server is because both times it is encrypted with layers of encryption that they can't remove.This is kind of gives you an insight into what it isThat's clever about onion routing they think about some of the other things that it does.K3 knows who the server is because it receives a message. That said I'd like to go to FacebookSo it knows that someone on this network in visiting Facebook, and it knows that the nextHop is this chap this router here it knows nothing else. It doesn't know who this client isIt doesn't know who router one is so there's no way for it to say: Ahh, Mike's visiting Facebook again, right?He's on there too often, because the way that the Tor protocol works. You don't actually know when you decrypt your layerHow many more layers there are there could be 200 nodes and layers they don't tend to be but they could be.so the output node only knows what's going on on the server side andSimilarly the input node my external is called a guard node is only aware that this client is browsing Tor any messagesIt receives are usually encrypted with two other layers of encryption that it can't decrypt so it just says wellI've got this message. I need to forward it on to this router. That's all I know rightI don't know, but they're on Facebook. I don't know that they are on a forum or they're doing amazon shoppingI don't know anything about what they're doing, so this is what Tor does Tor is in essence an implementation of this approach, right?So it has a protocol with you know message lengths and structures that are well defined in itsDocumentation that specify how you establish these keys how you send these messagesHow each one should decrypt them and forward them on to the next one, but in essence what you do isThis client here will create what we call a circuitWhich is this three hops, byfirst establishing a shared key of him then instructing him to do the same and then him to do the same andadding extending the circuit each time they want to with new nodes on the end andEvery time I do that all the previous messages have been encrypted. So nobody knows what's going on, so it's quite interestingIs it slower because of all these hops? It's a lot slower like you've got to consider thatThese nodes first of all they might be they might be serving a lot of clients at once so there might be other ca-uhh, keysshared with other people coming in here and leaving here and this one might be an exit node sometimes and he's talking to servers andbrowsing the web for peopleand so yesYou don't want to be signing up to be an onion router if you haven't got quite a lot of bandwidth also consider that they?May not be located very close together, right?So this could be in Germany this one in the united states this over in Japan not really importantbut a point is that it's making you know large global hops which take in the order ofSub-second but not small amounts of timeso you can expect to wait aLittle bit longer for your messages to get through, all right, but the benefit you get is that no one knows?What what it is you're doing, right?We've got a situation here where no one really knows anything about what's going on at all, right? Which is very very cleverandHas obvious benefits to people who want to remain anonymous.Now there's a few things we've missed outIt's a lot of things I've missed out right because because the Tor protocol is quite complicatedBut this is the general idea the first thing is that if you go, if you if you create this circuit,And then you just go to Facebook and type in your username password and click itYou know that's going to give away what you're up to, all right, Facebook will know who you  are for a startBut if you go to a website, that's not even encrypted at all. This is sent in the clear, right?So someone's sniffing in at this pointLet me use my blue pen for sort of eavesdroppers like if someone's eavesdropping in at this positionThey'll know exactly what you're doing, right?And you type in username and password then they have your username and password. So you still have to use TLS or HTTPS,uhh,connections to the actual servers right, but that's really on you once you've set up this circuitYou said normal HTTP requests and responses to servers as you would normallyIt's just instead of it going through your normal internet connection and your normal ISP router it goes through this circuitand with all the encryption happeningso in actual fact theImplementation the Tor uses. It works essentially like a proxy you talk to your own proxy server which handles all this for you and thenresponses come back so yes your web connection is a little bit slower, but for all you know it'sJust a normal connection to a server. That's basically how it works is really not a lotmore to it than that right and it's quite elegant, and it works very very wellis using tools that like just installing a different kind of browser?YeahYou use a Tor browser or you can use it as a service and then you know pipe other thi- other services through itBut Tor is not illegal and nor should it be it's just encryption. There are a few downsides right the first aside from the speedThe first is thatpeople can sniff on this network and start to get the pieces of the puzzle the more positionsYou are you know the more pieces you get right?But so if I'm sniffing here at position A then what you see is you see that I'm using Tor you can't see anything elseIf I'm sniffing here or here I learn nothing right apart from this encrypted messages going on Tor these onion routers arelisted publicly in the directory so finding their identity is not aGreat concern of mine if I'm sniffing a position B at the exit nodeI find out that someone on Tor is visiting this website if it's encryptedLet's say using TLSThen that's all I find out the next question that people be asking is what happens if I control both A and BAll right, if I'm at the front of the network going in and at the exit nodeCan I start to find out?What's going on? And the answer is yes, right?That's the weakness of Tor and something that basically is unsolvable apart from just to be very very vigilantSo how would this work, well?You've got to remember that this is the big network. There's lots of users on itC is not the only person talking to this router, right?He's going to be the intermediary for conversations the third node the second node the first nodeHe might be an exit node. He might also be talking to serversThere's a lot of traffic going in and out like some of which is Tor some of which is notWhat we're talking about is looking at a lot of traffic coming from my machine to this routerAnd a lot of traffic going from other routers to websites and trying to correlate them and work out what it was that I didRight, which is not an easy job, but you can imagine that if you've got some time signature of messagesBut let's say a sort of message, message, message, message, messageThen talking to this server coming out here is going to be a kind of mess of lots of messagesBut you might be able to find the key points that match upWith what I sent in like that's the idea this traffic. Analysis is the mainApproach to essentially De-Anonymizing people if you found that I sent 15 messages of a certain size anda certain Sort of Tempo should we say andThen you found out that those 50 messages came out somewhere else on the networkAt the same just shortly after let's say a half a second after, at the exact same tempoThat's a little bit interesting.With all these layers of encryption does that change the file size?No, which is a good thing right? This is cleverly designed with that in mindSo Tor messages are called cells and cells are 512 bytes long. They're always512 bytes long the way that a router works out whether it'sReading a message or whether it needs to forward it on it's basically based on a smallhash or digest that's held in the message essentially it looks at the tail end of the message,calculates a hash on it and goes wellthat doesn't match the hash I've got at all it must still be encrypted because it's nonsenseSo then it knows to forward it on, see. And it does this by basicallyavoiding changing the size of the message it will be obvious as you say right if ifthree layers of Encryption added ahead of each timeYou would know how far along the hops were and the whole attack would be a lot easierRight so onion routing is based around the idea that any message between any node in the network looks like any other messageRight it could be the first one could the last one it could be something in the middleRight it could have nefarious information on it. It could have perfectly benign information on it impossible to know all rightWhich is really really clever.There's a lot of research on Tor that goes intoWorking out how to minimize a chance for both A and B are nefariousThat's the idea, so this is why they sometimes call these guard nodes because usually you select some trusted onesAnd you only use those for example.

   "publishedAt": "04 Aug 2015",
   "transcription": "So cryptography is the idea ofencrypting a message so thatalthough everyone knows the message has been sentthey can't actually find out what it means.Whereas in steganography we'retrying to hide the fact that we've sent a message at all.So a classic example would be if i waswriting you a letter and then I wrote ininvisible ink a whole different letterbetween the lines or on the other sideor something like that... And only you knew that that was going to be there.So you get home and everyone else maybe looks at the letterand thinks \"it's not very interesting at all\".And then of course you can uncover the secret message.Today we'll talk a bit about \"digital image steganography\"because obviously there's a huge scope for hiding things in digital images:Images can be megabytes or moreand you can hide files of megabytes or more in them.But of course as the the amount of steganography in images increase,so is the attempts to try and find it.So there's lots of statistical approaches to try to find these things as well.Perhaps the most simple form of steganography an image is\"least significant bit steganography\"So if we've got a bitmap of any kind (a PNG or BMP)then we can change the lowest bits to be our messageand you'll have an almost imperceptible changeon the actual way the image looks.It's a bit like if I change the number 800,351if I changed the 1 or the 51 on thatit's not gonna have a massive effect...- That's exactly right, the number so big thatin the grand scheme of things it makes no difference.So generally speaking we'll change (in an image) in every single bytewe'll change the last bit or maybe the last two bitsif we really try to cram in a lot of data.Every byte is eight bits, we take the last two and change that to our messagein the hope no one's going to notice.So, for every byte (that's every 8-bits) six of them are the regular imageand two of them are our secret message,so a quarter of our message is now secret.So if we have a normal pixel, it's going to be 4 bytes long(so that's one byte) so for each bytewe're talking about the last two bits in that byte.So that could be a 1, we canchange it 1, change it to 0 or leave them both the same.And what we do is we readoff our messageso let's say our message we're trying toencrypt is 10 11 01Okay? We get to the first byte and we say:well this is great,our first two bytes are already 1 and 0 so we don't need to change anything at allso that byte stays as it is.So we go to the next byte, so this will be maybe redand this might be green in our pixel.Okay? The last two bits of this byte are 0 and 1,the two we're trying to put in from our message are 1 and 1,so we change this one to a 1.So by changing that second leastsignificant bit from 0 to 1we've just increased this value by twoand we're talking about one channelin a huge image - changing by two levels is probably not going to be too noticeable.If we start changing the highest significant bits then that might be a problem.All right, so I've written a program to do thisand I've tried to hide a rather large fileinside another rather large imageOK, so this is a nice picture of a treeIt's about 3 (and a bit) megapixels insize.So this is the original image of our treeand that is the steganographic image.First one, into the second one.- It's not changing!- It is changing.When you only change the last two significant bitsof an 8 bits per channel imageyou're not going to see a huge amount of detail.if you actually do a subtraction on the images, you can see a differencebut in general it's going to be pretty imperceptible.The really good thing to do would be to never release the original source image.I can tell that something has changed because I've got the original andthe new steganographic image with me.But if I just sent out an image of my dogand I never sent out the original that the camera tookno one's going to know that it's beenimperceptibly changedbecause they haven't got a reference.If you take a public domain image and change it,it's gonna be easy to look for the original source.- [...]- ExactlyThe other thing is, it'll work better on photographs wherethere's a lot of variation (in the intensity levels anyway).So this steganographic imagehas the entire works of Shakespeare buried in itwhich comes to (when it's zipped up) about...1.5 MB, something like that.This kind of simple steganography can be detected.This image here is an image that I've createdby taking only the last two bits of each channel.I've scrapped all the other information.If a pixel has a value of 0, its black,if it has a value of 3 it's white, and then it ranges in-between.And you can see that it's a tree there, so you can see even in the first two bits that there's a treeand the sky is particularly bland.So if you look instead at the steganographic imageI've done the same filters to thatand you can see but the amount of noise is increased massivelybecause that noise is all hidden in those least 2 significant bitsSo you can see if you compare the bitsfrom one image to the other, you can see a difference and sohiding a messages in the least significant bits is fairly obviousparticularly if you have the original for comparison.So this is the difference between those two imagesand I've massively scaled up the differenceI mean it looks very gray.these white pixels and black pixels arevalues of plus or minus 3 intensity changes.So we're still talking verysmall differences over the imageand it's very evenly distributedit's all sort of spread noisily throughout the image- Yes so you can't actually tell that there's a tree there now.- No, you can't tell there's a treethere. Which could be a clue!Perhaps the more sophisticated method of hiding something in an image would be to hide itinside the Discrete Cosine Transform Coefficients of the jpeg.So we talked a little bit about the DCTand how we convert an image into a series of cosine waves.And we have coefficients sayinghow much of each of those waves we have.If you change those coefficients instead of changing the raw pixel values,you have a much less predictable effect on the image:if you change the value of one of the alternating large current coefficientsfrom 202 to 201you're gonna have a very imperceptible difference and it's going to happen overthat entire 8x8 blockso you're not going to be able to seethe clear sort of steganographic noisethat we just looked at on that tree.A common algorithm that we see in use is called JSteg.So I see what you did there.And what JSteg does is it goes in and if it can it will cramDCT coefficients full of as much data as it can.And what it does is: any coefficients aren't 0 or 1 (because they might change and be a little obvious)so usually be low frequency ones might change up or downand you can see again that the difference is almost imperceptible.So here's a picture of a panda and what I've done here:I couldn't cram in as much information as before so it's just much better than this one.So there is the original and asteganographic image.And I've looked at these and I've [...] a bit of differenceand you can see that againit's very, very, very slight so thesepixels again have only changed byplus or minus 3 maybe one maybe two.- So that's just zoomed in on the...- That's zoomed in on the difference right thereso you can see that, yes, the pictures have changed, but have not changed by a lot.And the other crucial thing about hiding your message in the DCT coefficients:the jpg has already completely messed up the least significant bits of the image.So if you do an image like I did wherewe're looking at just the bits,we will no longer be able to see a tree, w'll just be able to see very general jpg noiseand that will be exactly the same in our steganographic image,so you can't do what they call a visual attackby looking and seeing if there is asteganographic message hidden inside,because there's no real change.So this is the original and i'm onlyshowing here the least two significant bits.And you can see that they form intolittle blocks[...] blocks is the 8x8 DCT blocks.And this is the steganographic data soyou can see that the blocks have changed,but the distribution of noisethroughout the image hasn't changed at all,so it's very difficult to see there's a message buried in thereAnd if the message took up only a certain amount of the imageit's hard to see where in this image themessage is.You could be trying to read off every DCT coefficientwhen in fact only some of them have a message in.- If you were sending this to someone as a message...how would they get it out?- OK, so in general you would also encrypt the messagebecause, you know, you better be safe than sorry, why not use encryption.So we encrypt our message, we put it into DCT coefficientsor in the least significant bits, andthen we send it off to someone.Now, they're going to have to have known the process that we used because if they don't,they're gonna be looking in the wrongplace, so they'll knowthat we used J Stag or F5 or one of the other DCT steganography tools andthey're basically run the programthey'll type in their decryption keywhich will actually remove theencryption and then out comes the message.When JSteg was invented, it was robust a visual attackso you couldn't look at it and go: \"well that clearly has been altered\".So they had to try and come up with -research had tried to come up with- some other way ofdetecting that an image has had a JSteg message buried in itand what in fact happens is thatthe coefficients change ever so slightly.Because we're applying quantization to our DCT coefficients, most of them will be set to zero.OK? And JSteg won't put anything in there, because it's too obvious;it'll only put them in a few at the top corner that are big,and you'll find that there's a subtle imbalance produced in where your coefficients areso you expect most your coefficients to be 0 and then a fair few of them to be -1 or 1and -2 and 2 to be very close tozero.And in fact you start to get a few 3s and 4s that you weren't expectingand the distribution of these numbers goes off a little bit and you can start to predictthat the JSteg file has been buried inside.What's more is that this happens in each 8x8 block, so you can actually do this teston every block and find out which blocks have messages in them, which books don't.And you might find for example that the first 60% of the file has a message inand then abruptly stops and that's a blatant cluethat we've got something that isn't  taking up the whole imageIt's has just been written sequentially into the file.So if we take the frequency of thenumber of occurrences of eachDCT coefficient - so nought (0) isgoing to be the most common,there may be -1 and 1, and we plot those in a graph withfrequency on the Y-axis and the DCT coefficient on the X-axiswe get what's called a histogram and that's simply a plotof the frequency ofoccurrences of various things.So you can do a histogram on an image, but you can also do a histogram on theseDCT coefficients and find out whetherthey've been imperceptibly changed.Once people started routinely detecting JSteg, other people came along anddecided well that's, you know, it's tooobvious, so let's try and make it be more subtle.So what they did was theywrote DCT steganography approacheswhere they pay attention to the statistics of the coefficientsand try to keep them balanced.So if you put in a 1you try to take one out somewhere else so that you keep the histogramand the probabilities of these coefficients occurring at the same.And that makes it much harder to use your standard histogram analysis techniqueto find out whether there's anything in the image.but now what they can do with the power of machine learning is:Take let's say a thousand images, 10 of which may or may not havesomething buried inside and aclassifier will pretty well find out which ones they are.You just have to have a lot of positive and negative samples to throw at it.- It all sounds wonderful but you know, [???]- Well. yeah, so aside from spies I should say i'm not using these techniques.you know everyone's watching....- [???] are going through your Instagram- Exactly, so I think one of the most common uses is digital watermarking.So in normal steganography what we want to do istry and hide a message as well aspossible.And then all that really matters is the person on the other side can get itand no one else really notices.In watermarking what we want to try and do is fingerprint to file so that we knowwhere it came for we know it's ours,maybe for copyright reasons or totrace who's been distributing illegal material.And the key to a watermark is, instead of it being as much payload as possibleso instead of trying to cram the entireworks of Shakespeare into an imagewhat you should be doing is just a small... let's say a small logo or a small piece of textrepeated over and over so that ifthe image gets cropped image gets re-compressed, it's still there.You can imagine that stock photo companies might do thisto try and make sure that peoplearen't distributing their files elsewhere.And you can imagine thatthey would stroll through the weblooking for steganographic imagesembedded in their particular way.Another case you might find if you were distributing pre-release DVDs of a filmand then it gets leaked onto the internet...If there's steganographic data on the source buried in, you'll be able to see who it was that leaked it.- Each file could be tailored...- Each file could be tailored withthe person they originally sent that file toand then when that particular find their way onto the Internet, that person is going to be in trouble.What was vital in recreating this image is now gone and we're not going to get it backand in fact that's exactly what you dosee so if we show the actual output herewe can see [...] is kind of visible butit's been completely dwarfed byall this random noise that's been added...",

   "title": "How to Choose a Password - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "20 Jul 2016",
   "transcription": "Some people watching will have goodpasswords, some people will have thoughtabout this before,some people should have thought aboutthis and haven't, and hopefully willafter we talked about this a little bitmore. Um, in the previous video I showed youcracking a password using pretty basictechniques, right?There are people who knowmore about this than me who run othercustom dictionaries and rule-sets andthings, right?It's not really importantfor getting the message across of justhow quick this is.Picking a good passwordwas actually a lot easier than peoplemake it.XKCD alluded to this and we'll talk about thatin a minute. It didn't necessarily answerevery question but it did get a goodmessage across and then as other aspectsshould you reuse passwords and, and soon.Umm... so let's address these. Passwordcrackers and and people who researchpassword security talk about somethingcalled password entropy, which is theamount of information held in a password,the idea being that if you're notholding much information in a password, it'sgoing to be cracked very quickly becauseit's not a muchsearch space to go through. Now in someways I think that's a bit of anovercomplicationI think practically you need to look attwo things. You say, first of all, can itbe brute-forced, right?In which case if the answer is is yourpassword shorter or equal to 8 characters,the answer is yes,right? If your password's ninecharacters and you're using symbols,you're probably ok, right? Fairlystraightforward, ok?As GPUs get faster,these barriers go down, and then you've got toask, \"Is your password dictionarycrackable?\", right? Those people in the lastvideo didn't think so,and then there I was cracking theirpasswords and they had quite good ones,some of them.So you've got to do twothings: you've got to make sure yourpassword is long enough and usesinteresting characters so it can't be bruteforced, but beyond that you've got to makesure that you can't be dictionary attacked.Let's get this out the way first; if yourpassword is \"password\", you probably wantto close out your browser right now andchange it and, you know, hang your head alittle bit. If there's any variation onthe word \"password\" or has any of thenumbers \"1 2 3 4\" in order in it, you needto delete those passwords,maybe delete your account out of shame, right?Because, oh dear.Ok, so I'm not addressing those, I'mdressing... addressing, I guess, whatwhat a better password will be. Nowpassword systems in general are not a veryuseful way to authenticate, right? A lot ofpeople think this,ok? Because they're hard to remember,unless you pick an easy one to remember,in which case it's easy and not secure,alright? So, in some sense we've tried tofind a way of authenticating ourselveswhich is hard for a human to remember,easy for a computer to guess, and peopledo it badly, right? There's lots ofreasons why passwords are terrible. Googlethinks passwords are going the way of theDodo, because they're bringing in this newauthentication system where, you know, ittracks your movement in your pocket andthings like this.Fine, maybe that will work, but in theback you're always going to have somekind of password, because you don't wantto be pulling your phone out of yourpocket and Google saying, \"you moved yourphone weirdly, so can you type in yourPIN code\", right? You're gonna have to havesomething backing it up at all times.For now, we're going to have passwords for awhile longer.And so we have to think about what theyshould be.So, obvious rules: 8 characters, 7 characters, not long enough,right? If you have an 8 characterpassword and you assume, just for aminute, that the website you're hostingit on is storing them in MD5, thenI'm going to be trying passwords at forty billion hashes per second.How long's it gonna take me to getthrough eight? Not that long, right? If I'msmart about my character sets, less thana day, a few hours probably.So, let's talk about the better approachor the nearly perfect approach of XKCDand how can we improve even on that.So XKCD suggested the situation where youhad a decent password, because it washard to remember, because it was someword that you've got. Is it \"troubadour\"?And you change a few letters around fornumbers, and you capitalize things andyou stick in a symbol somewhere andthings, and his argument is that thisisn't a good password because there'snot much entropy, because you're doingstandard things that people do inpasswords, right? Now that's absolutelytrue in the sense that if you replace an'e' for a '3',everyone does that, that's number... ruleone on the list, ok? Don't think that'sclever because it's not. lf youreplace a 'z' for a '3', actually that'sstill not very good.Let's pick a better one. If you... an 'o', ifyou replace an 'o' for a '3', that's slightlybetter, but someone's still probably goingto have written that rule, because why wouldn'ttheywhen it's so fast to try them out? Ok, soyou've got one option which is up whichis a kind of hard word to rememberwith a bunch of weird to remember symbolexchanges, and then you've got anotherone, which is just four words appendedtogether: correct horse battery staple.Ok I think that's the order, right? Noweveryone knows that password whichkinda means that password is not very good,but the point remains: if you pick, hisargument is that if you pick four words and juststick them together, you have... It'sinherently un-brute-forceable, if that's averb,right? Because it's too long, even withall lowercaseeven without symbols and things, and it'snot really gonna come up in a dictionarymuch because those are weirdcombinations of words that aren't very oftenused, and it's four of them.Ok, so how breakable are these twopasswords? Well, first of all, troubadourwith all those exchanges probablyslightly harder than he suggests, becauseits entropy is not bad.I think it's 11 characters and you knowthere's some exchanges there. Not all of them areimmediately obvious.So it's not absolutely terrible andperhaps slightly better than many things buthe's absolutely right but it's quitehard to remember and a bit of a pain,certainly a pain to type in. \"correcthorse battery staple\", much easier to remember,no funny characters to press, you get totype that quite quickly but the issue isthat we don't brute force passwordsof that length, we dictionary attack them, right?So the question really comes down to, \"is'correct horse battery staple' going to comeup in a dictionary attack?\", and the answeris, \"probably not\", but once we startthinking people are just appending fourwords together,maybe yes, ok? So instead of our passwordcracking being a brute force of thenumber of characters to the power of thelength of our password,it becomes the number of words we mightuse to the power of the number of words weare using, okay?So in this case, let's say the topten thousand words to the power of 4, okay?Which happens to be a very big number,so we're kind of safe.But what if you only pick obvious words?\"Staple\", I've checked, right? I'vechecked a list of about the top20,000 english words; \"staple\" is somewherearound 12,000, right? Which means that wedon't tend to use it very often,that makes sense. \"Horse\" is much further upthe list so were \"correct\" and \"batteries\"further up the list as well.I mean, we all have phones, we talk aboutbattery all the time. So, if youhypothetically picked four words that werein the top five hundred, then suddenlythe search base is 500 to the power 4 whichis much smaller and your bad passwordis crackable.So, my advice to anyoneattempting a password system like thisis to assume that the person attackingyou knows you're doing a password systemlike this and pick hard words, right? Abrand name or a word that isn'tgoing to come up in a list of obviouswords that people use, ok?\"staple\" is not a bad word, the otherthree are not great.So, you know, change it for something else, ok?Off the top of my head, uh... \"lemming\" isprobably not a very common word we use, ok?Don't use it now, because I said it. I've gota Rubik's Cube, here \"rubik\" is probablynot, or \"Rubik's\" is probably not in the topten thousand english words, right? Whichmakes a search space much harder to use, ok?We're changing the problem around to bea question of can they guess the word you'llusednot the structure of your password, ok? Soa really good password will be threeenglish words, i would say, right? With oneword that's a bit out thereOk a bit odd; maybe it's a made-up wordor something, right? Because then youcan't be brute forced because of the length,you can't be brute force because of acombination of easy dictionary words,right? And you don't need to put symbolsin, because it's just too hard anyway.Ok, that would be really strong. If youwant to be even stronger than thatthen just stick an underscore right inthe middle of one of the words, just toreally annoy everyone, right? Because ifyou stick it between words it's going tofit into a standard rule set of the sortof things people do with passwords, butif you put like an ampersand in themiddle of a word that shouldn't have anampersand in it, like \"horse\",\"ho&rse\" in the middle of\"correct ho&rse battery staple\",it's just that much harder to crack. Andthen, for you to be able crack thatpassword, a lot of things have to goright for the attacker.They have to know the four words you'regoing to use, in the right order, and theyhave to have tried that with the exactright rule set that put an ampersand in atthat exact position. And pick a word thatother people don't use very often, likeyour favorite band name or somethinglike that, ok?Because that way... maybe not yourfavorite band name if you blog about thembecause then they can social engineerthe password, that's a different question.This is what you do if you have to picka password, right? But what you shouldreally be doing now is using a passwordmanager.So, in some sense a password managerswaps you remembering a bunch ofpasswords for you hopefully rememberingone really good password, ok?So this is the kind of password policythat you go even further with and makethat your master password.So what a password manager does if it'swell programmed is encrypt a database ofyour passwords for all your different websitesand and and you know accounts and thenyou secure that with a master passwordof some description, right? And yourmaster password has to be good and idon't mean, you know, \"password passwordpassword\" because no one's going to guessit's three times long, right?It needs to be of the level we were justtalking about.And you also need to look into whatencryption the password manager uses,where's the decription done, it's notdone on the server, we need to makeabsolutely sure it's all local and thingslike this. So look into it and see howthey do their security.I've looked into a lot of password managers.They're all pretty good, you know, ofthe major players, right? They all use broadly similar schemes, they use verydifficult to break hashes with lots ofiterations, which means that even if yourpasswords are released on the internetthey're in encrypted form and they can'tbe obtained.So all my passwords are 16 characters oftotally random and I don't know whatthey are, right?So if my... if my databasegets deleted i'm somewhat in a problemright?But, my master password is similar,I won't give away too many too muchinformation on what exactly it is it, right?But my master password is in a similar veinto what we were discussing just now andI believe is essentially uncrackable at,you know, currently. But i can type it inquite fast, because I've done it a lot.It's long enough and i can remember it,which is good, and i only have toremember one which makes it that mucheasier.So now, when you log on to a websiteand it says, \"register for thiswebsite\" again, and I'm only going to use it for five minutes,what am I going to do? I'll justmake it my standard password that Iuse every time. Instead of doing that, youthen go to your password manager andgenerate random 16 characters and it'swin-win because then, if you never usethe website again, it doesn't matter anyway, becauseyou've got... you've got a random password.And if someone, if that website is a bitdubious and they release your passwordlater in a hack, it doesn't matterbecause it's random, right?And that brings us on to last point:never ever reuse passwords, ever.I fallen to this before, someone triedto log into my Facebook once with apassword that got leaked,someone tried to log into my Skype with apassword that got leaked, and that was myfault in a sense, because I used to usethe same password a number of timesbefore I knew what I was doing,right? This is a few years ago. Now, I knowyou have to have different passwords.That way, if a password gets leaked downto the internet and hopefully it's randomanyway, from your password manager thenwe're in business, right? You change thatpassword, and you're secure again. If yourmaster password for your... for yourdatabase is weak, then they are going tohack it, and then if they get in they getall your passwords. So, obviously that has tobe really really strong.Last Password'sbeen hacked a couple of times, butthis encryption is so strong that if yourif your master password is strong it'sfine.Which is a bit Cavalier thing to say, butit's actually true because of how manyiterations they use.",

   "title": "Slow Loris Attack - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "09 Nov 2016",
   "transcription": "This is not really relevant to the video, actually, but this is a slow loris.I just wanted to show it because it was cute,that's all...  Don't keep them as pets though.Now, the slow loris isI guess my favoriteDenial of Service (DoS) attack -- now thatsays a lot about me, doesn't it, that I have a favoritedenial of service attack...Before we demonstrate anything, of course, let's get straight out in the open,you shouldn't be using slow loris on anyone, or any other DoS attack on anyone else, alright, becauseyou'll get in a lot of trouble.Most DoS have this idea that you try and defeat some web server, [or] some computeron the other side of the web, by giving it as much bandwitdh as you can, such that it breaks, right,they have a certain amount of bandwidth [that] they are allowed to use. and if you give them more than that,or try to request too many web pages, their server goes down. That's the general idea of a DoS.Distributed DoS is just the next level, where you have multiple computers all attempting to do the same thing,and then, more modern DoS will use amplification and things like this, to try and improve this even more.But, the whole point is as much bandwidth as you can all at the same time, alright, and if you get enough,you can take them down. If you don't, then they just laugh, right?So, you know, Microsoft and Google, you're going to have difficulty bringing them down.But, smaller websites, it can have a massive impact on the amount of money they are making,if no one can visit their shop, or something like that, so it's a real problem. What I like about the slow loris isit comes at it from a completely different way. It's a protocol attack, so a layer-7 application attack,which doesn't need a lot of bandwidth, so I can do a slow loris on someone and then browse the webas normal, play computer games... So let's think back to how me talking to a web server works.I send off a \"get\" request to a website, and I say \"get me index.html\", then the web serversends back index.html, and that's the end of that conversation, right, then I start upanother conversation that says: \"I've read this index.html, I now need, you know, header.jpeg\",so I send off another get request, and so on, and we have these short conversations back and forth.Now, usually, an HTTP request is just text, right, so it litterally says \"HTTP get 1.1\", or something,index.html, where I'm sending it, a bit about me, so I'm using, you know, Firefox or something,and then some other data, and then it always ends with two caret return line feeds, so two new lines, right,so, normally in text we have a caret return character, and then a line feed character, two of those signals the endof an HTTP request. What the inventor of the slow loris, some hacker named Rsnake, I think, (indeed!)decided was \"what if I never send those caret return line feeds, can I just keep the website waiting for me,can I go so slowly, by asking for website so slowly, that I just break them\", right?And yeah, he can! And -- and so they have things like timeouts and stuff so maybe let's sayI'm in the middle of browsing a website, and then -- on my phone, right -- and just as I'm in the middle ofsending off a request, I lose phone signal, right? That's pretty common, you know, these days,so that would timeout on the server's end as well, and they would let the connection go,and then they conserve someone else's website. The problem comes if I don't send no data, I send some data,but just painfully slowly. What's great about the slow loris is, there's hardly any code, it talks to a web server,and it basically says \"get me index.html\", or something like that, and then sends a space, or a 0,or a random number, or something like that, and then it waits for about, you know, 10, 20, 30 seconds,just when the website is about to assume it's gone, and sends another single byte, and says\"I'm still here! I'm just really slow\", and then it does this again, and it does this again, and keeps thatconnection going as long as it can, and then it does it with 200 other connections,or as many connections as it can. So, my computer sending out this attack, it's sending 200 byte packetsevery minute or so, it's not a lot at all, and it's very difficult for a firewall or something to notice this,because these are valid HTTP requests, they're just super slow, right, andyou know maybe I've just got a really bad internet connection, maybe.Now, this doesn't affect every web server, it mostly affects Apache, because of the way Apache works.Unfortunately, Apache is very prevalent, there's about 40, 50% Apache these days,it's hard to know for sure, but I had a quick check, and that seems to be about the right estimate.Apache when they designed it, they decided it would be a good idea to start up a new threadto serve every concurrent connection, so when a connection comes in with an HTTP request, theyset up a new thread that handles that request, and then the thread goes away when it's finished.Now, that wasn't entirely stupid, you know, if the connections appear, and then they go away,that's not a problem. But if the connection starts to stay longer than we anticipate, then our connection limitgets reached, so Apache will have a connection limit of, let's say, 200 concurrent connections,because beyond that you've just got so many threads [that] the whole thing starts to grind to a halt.So, what slow loris does, is begin to open connections, and as a new one gets freed up,from someone else using the website, they'll open that one, and this one, and that one, until they gotall the connections. So, let's see how it works, right, so I've come up with another of my glorious websites,just for this, \"Mike's website\"! So, that's actually this computer here, which is running Windows and Apache.Now, so this is my website, with my company profile, and lorem ipsum. What this website is, is not very important.Let's have a quick look at the code, this is not the original implementation of slow loris, this is a Pythonimplementation I found, but essentially, it's not very long, right, 67 lines, which another reason in our kit,because it's so elegant. Really, what it does -- it has some code here, to start up a socket, which is a TCPconnection, and make it get requests, here's our get request text, and then, for all existing sockets,down here, can we send a little bit more data every 15 seconds. And if a socket dies, we recreate it, and we justkeep that going, and we'll do this for 200 concurrent sockets, which is more than my Apache installationis configured to handle. So let's run this -- there we are, python, slow loris, to the IP address that we justlooked up. Alright, it's creating all the sockets, and now, it's just going to sit there, every now and then,sending a byte of data to the Apache web server. So, the web server thinks that it's got 200 people lookingat the website, when in fact it's got one person looking at the website really, really slowly 200 times.If I press refresh on this, because it has been cached, we can see we're now waiting.Waiting.(Sean:) So if you clear the cache now, in your browser, would that -- that not be able to get the website?(Mike:) No, it wouldn't be able to see the website, so let's go to website now, that we're under slow loris. So...Alright, we're waiting for it. I mean, we might get lucky, maybe one of these sockets drops out and then theserver can respond, alright, but we might not. But...(Sean:) You've clicked to go back to that same website, and of course it can't load it and so we're just sitting...(Mike:) Yeah and [at] some point we might see a timeout on this client-side, saying \"no, we didn't get any responsefrom the server\". This server is basically -- won't serve this website to me, because it's too busy serving200 other websites, or more specifically, busy waiting for us to finish the request 200 times so it can actuallyfinally get home with something.(Sean:) And how long would that carry on sending those requests? (Mike:) As long as I want.And, as soon as a socket dies, another one comes up, and it just keeps going.And, I mean, 67 lines of code, right, and here's the nice bit, \"fun things to do\", I can just use the net as normal --my net is fine, right, I'm not using all my bandwidth to do this, I'm using barely any of my bandwidth,which is what I really like about it. This kind of attack is called a low and slow attack.So there's a couple of others, \"RUded\", [meaning] \"are you dead yet?\", is another one that does similar things.And, what's clever about them is [that] they're quite hard to detect, because what it's doing is totally normalHTTP, it's just doing it incredibly slowly, and when they designed this, and when they designed Apache,they never thought you would do something like that, and that is exactly the problem with these sorts ofprotocol attacks: the assumption that they will always do what you expect them to do, and they won'tdo these random, strange things. So, yeah, my favorite DoS.",

   "transcription": "try a little bit different today afterwe did the video on Dykstra I thoughtwell you know sometimes I like to gohome and sometimes do a bit ofprogramming in front of the TV you knowthe person I am and one of the coolthings that you about being otherprogram is if you think all i wonder ifi could write something that would solvemazes you can immediately go andactually do that that thing so that'swhat we're doing today I've come over abit of a part of a small program notvery complicated that fold mazes thatyou give it an image for you get amazedit worked his way through it and thenoutput say the same picture made fromred line on it is very exciting and butI've also actually implemented lot ofdifferent search approaches so I didn'tgo into depth and breadth first searchand a star and Dykstrawant to see the actual code those thingsthen we'll make it available so otherpeople can follow along tweak it maybeimprove on what I've done it comes backdown to date well for the implementationvideo doesn't it because there are somany ways you can program something thatsolves an image-based maze and how I'vedone it is okay it probably isn't theoptimal I I had in mind i wanted to doreally big mazes in fifteen thousandpixels by 15,000 pixel maybe biggerabout around now so I can't go anybigger than that but so i'd love you tobe most semi efficient at the very leastyou know not completely impractical andso I thought to started by coming upwith some rules that my maid have tofollow because yeah okay so I could Icould give it any maze any picture madea photograph of amazed but then most ofthe time i'm going to be doing is nowjust trying to turn that into astructure in memory and that's what ajob right you want to be there I meanyeah yeah and i'm just doing it in frontof the TV you know I get carried away sowhat I said was I have a black and whitepixel image that hopefully doesn't havejpeg compression on it because activexeverything is a blackboard all the wayaround the outside that the wall andthen any black pixels wall anyway pixelspath and their intention to the top andan expert at the bottom that that was myboat my rulesI almost the other boot made it don'tfollow the rules are going to work inmyself where you can follow me to extendmyself with how they're closed amazed ifyou want I've got a very small imagehere called tiny dot PNG which you can'tsee because windows does not like toexpand these qualifies of images whatyou don't do is give it the 50,00050,000 image first go because if youhave any kind of problem you've no ideawhat we want my baby started a smallimage you can actually sort of debugwhat's going on in the code you couldsay well I was expecting this to happenand it didn't which means i made amistake or something like this to startwith a small cases and then work yourway up to the bigger think hopefullyonce you've got to add overbust albumthat work for small limited on the mazesjust get a big amazing should figurecross work first time we should think soi've taught amazed right that took agesto draw in video it butyou know just giving all this in alittle bit wayward here but you knoweach of these square in a square and Ihad enough nothing like that about itthan thatso my walls are that the outside isblackapart from the top has one picture oflight which is the entrance and thebottom have one picture of which is theexit those are my rules that have comeup with now I said there are loads ofways we could solve that mazeprogrammatically perhaps the first one Idid and it's so in the most obvious oneis just to put it into memory and thenkind of freak pixel look at theneighbors and see if we can go there andthen move there and if maybe we can go abit further and so on so that with mycredit first trial implementation what Idid was like I copied it into memory orstorage array and then I say that's mystart position at not 123 naught but andI said we'll look where can I go fromfree not well well the left pixel toknow is is black the color there and thenext pixel across for North is blacklonger there but this one isn't this 31is white so i'll go there and I'llcontinue my search from there and Ithink the same for the blue car lookedat look left look like process and everypixel like this is basically a flatfield but it's nothing smart about thisand it does work in the sense that itwill get into the end is loaded veryquickly you have to have a small butsays which nodes have been visited ifyou otherwise you're just going to go upand down up and down up and down up anddown it and get yourself into a loop orhere we got an actual loop we want to goaround and mailed if we don't have anyidea about where we've been so i createdanother a variety of the exact same sizeas this which was a true-or-false of afoodie the right and just if you've beenvisited you get that true and will evergo back there but because by definitionwe don't want to go backwards glue comefromright but what if you get go to adentist partially so the data structurethat i'm using to do this breadth firstsearch is it's one that keep a bit aboutour box to approach in our previousvideo keeps retractable windows thatcurrently under consideration buthaven't been invented yetso you know if it's been looking downhere have this one and maybe this onemaybe this one and when it gets to theend herewe'll just go out and work out a littlefall back to this one so it highlyinherently allows itself to backtrackand if I love doing it as you said thatas you sort of suggested which was Ijust kind of followed blindly then i'mgoing to be doing a lot of backtrackingnow I had actually implemented versionof that was much aware that of life leftturn version as well good luck Hardawayand implement a few different approachesthe problem with what i did here bywhich is why i'm not showing the code ofthis particular version is that it's abeneficent like it's it's not massivelyinefficient in memory because the rightdon't take up a huge amount we even fora really big image you know you know welove these kind of images when we takehigh-resolution photographs and thingsso it's not inconceivable that you havethat amount of memory the issue more isthat over made of that kind of Sighs theamount of nose under consideration startto grow really quite rapidly that putthe memory and computational overheadthat we don't want and also if I'mwalking down this path here let's sayand I'm here like I can't let the righthere called left or right hereI called left to right here and I'mspending a lot of time going to this oneadding it to the queue to this one andthen and going down here i'm taking onetwo three four steps when we really wantthat with a surprise now spit at peopleinterview at some point I'm going tohave to travel down there but I don'twant to store that information in memoryjust seems a bit inefficientso what i did was i wrote a a one-passwhich means one look over the image outwith them to turn this maze into a graphlike that one too dr. video i have noidea is the optimal album for thisprobably not but it was not going towork and it extends quite reasonably twolarge mazes as well let's have a quicklook at how that works let's go with ourgreen pen if we do one part of them whatwe have to do is make all the decisionswe want to make by just cutting processthroughout medical office was and thenacross thrown across the rope and youcould do it column wise but for the sakeof argument I've got that the mostobvious thing is once we get to thestart we can slide that the start andthat's good right so the first low wesimply move along until we get to startand we create a nodein that position that my note littlehave a little object in memory stored itand it will store any of theseconnections 20 neighbors but it can sothat's RS in the dark shades RS yes butin in my implementation decision tosomewhere in the array this is an actualtangible object in memory that has anorth east and west connection thatcould have something connected to it inthis case is not gonna have a lot ofconnection because you know not going togo anywhere so for the next row i cameup with a number of rules that dependingon whether you're looking at war on theflat part you do different things rightso the first one for example is ifyou're on a walldon't do anything but you can't rightnow there you can't connect and he knowsto that point it doesn't make any senseright so if you're on a wall but you donothing right and it's reflected in thecode if you're on a path and you were ona wall that means you want to startsomething new so we should create a nodebut it start to get a little bitconfusing but I can basically I can'twith different rules so in this one wetalked their dad we can't go up we werealready on the path that we do nothingthis one we've got something about thatwe can connect toso we create a node here and we jointhem up and we've just created a note sowe join them up like we know which isliterally created on the left so we'retracking the ones above the ones to theleft and we're going this way downalways so microsoft way can I take abreak in motion TV and then I come backthe next day and and i'm going to ok sonow but this node this goes intoanything this doesn't do anythingbecause awful down to glow decision tobe made at this node is no point we makeanything in memory for here here this isan obvious junction we can go down tothis point so we created those and weconnected back to the one we last saw onthe left and then again we get to thisone we're just in front of a wall at theend of the corridor that's so excitingwe create a node and rejoined out bythis now there's a few statementsinvolved in that what you saw in yourline think about the steps you have totake that each given position and what'sgoing on at that position doesn't takevery long to come up the steps you knowif there is a war on the left is all thelike is there a passel of those are thethings we basically have to check andthey will involve referencing the imageand saying is it was all that pixeland the next one below by this onedoesn't left her life so it's a pathgoing downwards and don't do anything onthis onealright this one the same this on theside on the next row this one is ajunction so we created knows weconnected to the last one is all aboutit which I stored in the listincidentally for those of you followingalong with my coach so we get to beforemrs. that this is the end of thecorridor we connect that in here westart one here because that's thebeginning of a corridor end of thecorridor connect them up this one takeno action and you get the ideaover time we start to fill in whereverthere's an interesting junction anythingto be doneyou see that this and we propagate thisthrough until eventually we finish offour graph this unit I will actuallyfinish it off because i went to all thetrouble of doing out there we arebut now it's my algorithm is correct allof these notes should exactly reflectare made and what we've got itinsulated increase memory because theseloads a slightly bigger objects in theunderlying away which is just smallnumbers but we have to take many fewersteps to go across this late you knowthe step counts from here to here is oneinstead of 3 and so on and depending onthe length of your corridors in yourmaze you can imagine that drasticallydecrease the number of nodes you have tobe expanding into and so they want todid was I said well okay so i put thisin the maze class so i go to class andobject in memory that stores this mazehave a startit happened and then I started writingother classes that their only task is togo to later be so i did that firstsearch which expands all of them oneafter anotherremember next and the next and the floodfill that first search with his fans asfar as to count one direction and thenthe next election and so on and thenleft her lonely which is where you withher less and you get stopped all thetime and it with her left but it's aclosed famous made solving album becauseif you're human and you can't see thewhole mazeit was quite well and then I alsoimplemented Dykstra in a style as wellso we'll see if it worksso that's one of the command prompt soapin an ideal world I would have a name ofthe file read in from a command lineparameters like I do actually have to dothat apartment was a bit lazy and Ihard-coded it so at the moment it wastiny dot PNG could have told me to andthat's the only made it done so Pythonso dot piethere we are and so it creates the imagedidn't take long with this is not a bigmaze in fact it took no second to solvemade it only got 23 knowslet's see if that's true 123456789 10 1214 efficient any more than 20 22 23 1quite pleased actually because I couldhave been really embarrassing but it'sthat pile of debugging that I was doingearly on and getting funny amount ofnose and you think we're done wrong okayi must have not connected these popularsomething I've got a very technicalquestion for you what was entirely whileall this was going to wasn't le oh yeahgood point arm something like that tocultural too hard it's got detailed plotis difficult for me to also do thiscommunity one thing that oneit took six 10,000 for a second i thinkthat is some fraction of a second to toactually find the path explored lightingknow that means it looked at mindimpossible cabin nodes and eventuallyfound a path that would have length 94here and if we look at the image whichagain it difficult to do on this screenso using the magic of editing this willnow appear very large and extremelypositive rather than that which has alsobeen linearly interpolated which isexactly what I didn't want to happen onthis pc my previous video on linearinterpolation so I thought a pass infrom glutamate which represents thestart to the endlet's see if we can do something alittle bit more challenging like so herei have a 2000 by 2000 image which whenyou load up on my screen looks like a mypatent now i use the program withDaedalus to generate this and you cangenerate very large mazes I'm taking itin some way on faith that there is abachelor star island could you know itdoesn't make a slightly different lifeprogram so i had to go in and start theend by partnumber why did on this oneand so on so let's see if it workso this is called 2000rpm gee that's ahard-coded change right on that and itwill take a little bit longer tocreative ways maybeget coffee there we go light so it tooka second to create the maid and it had760,000 node now when you consider thatamazing with two thousand pixels by 2000pixels which is four million pixels andlet's say half of them white on averagethen you would expect about 2,000 loadsif you were doing it the bad wayhow about I try to save some money thisway it's essentially what i'm doing itand then the actual the actual worm wasit that further breadth-first searcheveryone i was breadth-first apparentlypunch my code it takes 15 seconds not nolonger to get through that made andagain using wizardry I will resume in onthis and you can see it has found a paththrough so it looks like a generalarcing path but if we zoom in you cansee it's actually finding its way fromquite complicated maze the last in classis that the two major i just put inthat's open perfect mazes that meansthere's only one possible solutioneverything else is by definition a deadend now somebody's are like that like ifyou were to think of the ManhattanBridge systems amazed then in some waysthere's a lot of different parties couldtake and really what you want to do isfind the shortest one tomato got herehas multiple solutions to it and so forexample if I want a depth-first searchon it it will be going down the firstpart fine as far as possible and it maywell not take the shortest path becauseit would just go down as part of our twocans and that part might lead to theexit it just might be very long so if ichange my algorithm to this image andthen get first right and we run itokay he didn't take long 6300 knows ahundredth of a second to actuallycalculate it but it found all kinds ofsuper group through my mace and so calmdown here and then up here again andback down here now the chances iprobably just jumped across here orsomething sillyit just didn't occur to in some sensebecause it was falling apart was on Imean they're searching better associatedis two different problems like dependingon the northern knows you want to expandbut in this case suboptimal it would bethe site is not not the optimalalgorithm to use so I've alsoimplemented better search and a star andIsis dices shortest path and so on if Iturn turn it into Dykstra has a bit ofoverhead because you've got to set upyour quality q which i'm using Fibonacciheatdo that because if not he also in thecode that reprogram yourself so if werun this so the path length that debtfirst found with a fountain world andthe parkland dr establish will be theshortest path is 897 long they've beentaking a bit longer to do it just couldhave many overhead mostly there we goabout the actual shortest path throughthat maze which is significantly betterthan the last oneyeah get download the code have a playaround see if you couldn't work out whatI've done and what I shouldn't have donethat maybe you can fix it and then comeup with a live album if you want to tryto work your way through to make anddepend on how much rather you have youcan see what kind of that size have madeit will handle and we look forward toseeing some more picturesyes but partner isn't as fast as doingthis in depth they see something likethat but it's not too bad and absolutespeed is not important for this becausei was just looking for fun and deceivesee you know with work right so you knowif you want to be implemented in a parklanguage is not the point arithmetic andso on been you know go for it but",

   "publishedAt": "04 Aug 2014",
   "transcription": "There are several hard problems when designing software.I'm not talking about computer science hard problems like NP-complete things.I mean hard problems of design, and internationalisation is one of the worst.Let's imagine you started a social network. Let's imagine that you made it for English-speaking users.First problem is when someone called Chlo\u00eb joins,'cause Chlo\u00eb has an umlaut above her 'e' and is angry that she can't put her name in properly.So, okay, you say \"I'll open up and add a few more accent characters.\"Well, then someone Icelandic calls in, and he's got an eth in his name. Looks like that.Looks like that. Sounds like 'th.'\"Fine,\" you say. \"So let's use all of Unicode.\"And then someone probably breaks your site because there's control characters in Unicode that break everything.OK, fine, so you work out which characters are allowed to be used in names and you just stick to those.I mean, that's like 30,000 characters when you include all of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean text,but never mind! You put it in.And then you start getting some users in other countries.First problem you get is France.Your French translator calls and says,\"Look, you've got a \"Like\" button here, and what I want to put in is \"J'aime\" -- \"I like\" --but it's not quite big enough? I need you to make the button bigger?\"And there's problems like this all over the place where sentences that take five syllables in Englishactually take a whole two-paragraph description in some other language.So you tweak the design. You make it so that the lengths of texts can change.And then you start working out that what you really want to do is have some kind of drop-in system.So, in English, you can just put in \"%NAME likes this.\"And then you can send that over to the translators and --see, this is where I should really speak more than one language --but they can send back -- um, I'm gonna make up a language here --ah, they can say something like \"Mana %NAME adilo,\"which, in their language, means \"so-and-so likes this.\"Great! That system's gonna work! You can just send a load of text blocks to them and they can send it b--\"Hello? Ah, Italy. Yes. What's with -- right, you need to know the gender of everyone using this network.Why do you need to know that?\"Italian language relies on gender.The words in the sentence change depending on whether you're talking about a man or a woman.Well, that's, that's irritating 'cause you haven't asked users for gender.Facebook have this exact problem.But, OK, you start asking and the translators start sending back strings,and now, of course, anyone who doesn't fit immediately into male or female,and, if that surprises you, you need to get out more,but anyone who doesn't fit into those categories, well, now they're angry that they have to go into one or the other.You have to ask them, \"Well, languages don't support that. Which one are we going with?\"And, in fact, there's a lot of translators calling back and saying they can't support that.OK. You move past that. You dam down the storm and it moves on,and then you get a call from France again.They say, \"By the way, you've got a singular and a plural here, but you can't use the plural for 0.We don't say that something has 'no likes, we say that it has 'no like,'and 'one like,' and then 'two likes.'\"So, okay, I can put a special case in for that. And a few others call in and say,\"Um, yeah, we don't just have singular and plural. We have singular and dual and plural.Our words change depending on whether there's one of something, two of something, or many of something.\"OK. Great. Right. Special case in for that.And then, then, your Polish translator calls and they say,\"Right. We've got a paucal.\"Paucal is where you have a singular and then you have a different pluraldepending on whether the number of things ends with 2, 3, and 4, or some other digit!OK. Great. Fine. Put a special case in for that.And then your Romanian translator calls\"Yeah, we need a different plural for any group of objects greater than 20.\"OK. And then you finally get every different plural rule for every language in there,and now the translators are vaguely happy.Then your Icelandic translator calls, and they say,\"Right. You've got this '%NAME' thing that I'm just meant to replace.\"Icelandic changes how the names appear depending on what else is in the sentence.You might have \"Tom.\" Then it might become \"Toma\" or \"Tomi,\"and there are whole names that this doesn't work with because they don't fit the Icelandic pattern.You put all that in somehow, and then, then your German translator calls and is like,\"Look, you've got this uppercase and lowercase in.You wanna put stuff in big, bold uppercase letters sometimes, and I get that,but we have this double 's' character. When you turn it to uppercase, it becomes two S's,except sometimes when it doesn't, like in geographic names. Can you deal with that?\"OK. Right. Yes. I'll make sure we deal with that,but that's not even the start of it, because then your Arabic translator calls, and they say,\"Right. You're doing this thing where you take an excerpt from a post.You're taking the first 50 characters and then you're just putting a '...' on the end,and that works for some languages, but not in Arabic. You can't just chop a word in half,because the letters in one bit of the word change depending on the letters elsewhere.They all merge together into one nice, flowing thing,and computers can deal with that, but you can't just crop it halfway through!\"OK. Fine. Go with that. Then the Arabic translator goes on to say,\"By the way, you're dealing with right-to-left text, right?\"Of course you're not. You haven't thought of that because, because surely all languages go left-to-right.No, Arabic, Hebrew, they go right-to-left.And you say, \"OK. I can kind of flip the whole design around so it still works that way?\"And they say, \"Yeah, that would work, but then you're gonna have left-to-right names in the middle of right-to-left text,because you're gonna talk about someone who has a name in a different character set.Just make sure it can deal with that.\"Oh... Then, if you're British, your American translator calls, or vice versa, and they say,\"You need to make sure the date format is right.\"Because Americans, for some bizarre reason, do month-day-year. Brits, day-month-year.And, by the way, in America, the week starts on a Sunday, and in Britain, the week starts on a Monday,so you've gotta change all your calendars around,and, by the way, Europe wants 24-hour clocks and America wants 12-hour clocks, and -- numbers!Oh, God, we haven't started on numbers yet!Because Europe wants \"256.341,2.\" The comma and the full stop, or the period.If you're American, they're around the other way!Yeah, OK, you can deal with that and then, then the icing on the cake is your Indian translator callsand says they have the Indian numbering system.You don't say \"100,000.\" They have the crore and the lakh, so they would group it like that.And it all becomes incredibly, overly complicated and the last time I did a rant like this,I said that what you do is you get someone else's timezone code and you treat it as a black box.That, that doesn't work here because languages are infinitely more complex and subtle,and there are so many changes that will be unique to whatever it is you're designing.The black box that Facebook uses for translation won't work for whatever you're doing.It won't work if you're designing software for Windows or Mac or Linux or iPhone.You can use certain references, certain functions, certain little things to make it easier,but ultimately you are going to have to go out and translate it and deal with all of this wonderful mess,or you do what programmers have done for many years, and say,\"Yeah.

   "title": "TOR Hidden Services - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "09 Jun 2017",
   "transcription": "We've talked about Onion Routing and TOR, andnow i'd like to address the prickly subject ofhidden services, right? AKA the \"dark web\".So Max has done a good video on the Dark Web,and so you should definitely watch that one first,so you know what it is. But it's quite a controversial topic,because a lot of what happens on the Dark Webis illegal, right? There's no two ways about it, that is true.Some of it isn't, right, and a lot of what happens on TORin general--in fact the majority of what happens on TORin general, you know high Into the 90%and that, and above--is perfectly fine, right?it's just anonymous users browsing the web,doing regular things but the TOR Hidden Servicesare ones that the debate is about becausethey're the ones where you sort of say'well, look, is it worth this bit of encryption?Is it worth, you know, all the criminality that's on there and so on?'So here's my Cloud--my TOR Cloudand in essence, we've got lots of people going intothe network. lots of encrypted layers and thingshappening, bouncing around, and then peoplecoming out of the network to servers, right?Now the issue, from a security standpointIs what happens if There's someone Sniffing?Here andsomeone's Sniffing hereand They Can Correlate Traffic between the in and The outand Work out what it is that I am DoingSpecifically Right then the whole Report the whole Point of Tor Which is Anonymization?Has been defeated, Right? We already have encryption, so that isn't the point of talk,that's just how, They do the anonymous communicationso the Dark web. or a hidden service to use the Proper Term, isin Essence Where This server Moves inside this Cloud right so now We have a hidden service Running Inside this Cloud andThere is no B that's the Idea right so it Makes it very very difficult to find so there is Now a circuit that goesSomewhere Between AAround the PlaceTo this Hidden Serviceand at no point has that left the network so there's no traffic correlation that can be done, Right?All of these are just TOR  sale messages that all look exacly the same.Now, the way that TOR does this Is very very clever.Euh, and I Look I will look into a little bit of detail on the protocol that it usesBut It's managed to form aprotocol where neither I nor the serverknow who each other are, but we can still have a conversation which Is kind of nifty?OkaySo then, let's start again with Onion routingSo, Onion routing is a protocol that could theoretically be implemented elsewhere.There are other Mixing networks and things and other anonymization networksBut Hidden Services Is put predominately in the domain of TOR.And TOR got the most users and the most nodes and it's the biggest and is in the News the most.Let's Draw a little bit of a Network again, soI shouldn't Have Drawn These Boxes Like This Because Now it takes me agesSo here's my serverHere's my Client and theseI'm Just going to Drawn with Boxes Because otherwise it's going to take far too longThese are Onion routers, so remember in normal Onion routingThe Client will Produce some[Circuits] [or] some Hops and then they will Just Talk to the server but A server will be out on the normal Web Doing normalServer Thingsand won't be Anonymous what Hidden Services do IsAnonymize This Server so they Allow Both the Server and The Client to talk to each other Despite the fact thatNo One Knows who each other is Which Is quite Impressive[Now] of Course if You then use [that] service Connection to Log in You're going to know you are but You get the ideaThe Server Has To lay some Groundwork Down before A client Connects use a hidden Service Right so there's protocols in the TorSpecification for doing This but [what] the server will do when they come online Is they will pick Three Onion Routers at Random andName Them as Introduction Points so let's Pick Them at Random now These are just normal Onion Routers They're very Likely to be Just doingRegularNormal Routing Tasks Like Circuits Through other Clients Into Servers and Things Some of These might be Exit NodesEntry Nodes and so on but As far as I know all Onion Routers Can, also act asIntroduction Points it's not A big Job [I] didn't Require A Huge Amount of Bandwidth the server will Make ConnectionsCircuitsto These introduction Points They've Either Full on tour Circuits with Three hops in Between Them the idea being That These introduction Points Know They'reGoing to be introducing People to this serverBut they don't know who it IsWhy it's Already the server is Hiding behind A layer of Anonymity here it will send Them a message to say I'd like you toAct As an Introduction Point and ThenIt will Create something Called A server Hidden Service Descriptor which I was [write] Down here that will Include the service Public key forOccasion Purposes But I won't dwell on that Particularly butAlso Crucially the ip Addresses [of] These introduction Points Here Now These are all public Anyway they will Publicly ListedNow it will Publish This Descriptor to something Called a Distributed hash Table that is to [Say] all [of] the Routers on Torwill Hold Some in Some Part of the Information [on] all of These hidden ServicesAnd the idea Is that if I try and Look up a hidden ServiceThe [Roots] Are Responsible for it will Give Me Back the Descriptor by including the Addresses[Over] The Introduction Points Now the key for this Hash table is the Onion AddressRight so the Onion dress that Everyone Knows aboutIs actually derived from the public key [of] this Server and Is in Essence the key but GetsThese ips Out of the Distributed hash table the whole Point of this Is [that] the Onion Address isn't publicized on the Global Tor NetworkYou Just find it other Ways like on A netOn an Internet or your friend tells you or?in an Email or something like this the [Waiver] [the] Distributed hash Table IsProgrammed The vast Majority of Nodes Won't know what the description Is for A given Key I?Only want more Probably or couple so there's an Inherent Security here it doesn't until Recently it'sAlso Made it Quite difficult to Work at how Many Hidden services There were so this Is all set up now the server sits ThereAnd Waits for [Internet] [Connections] [Or] People to ask for A, web web file Nowand These Onion Routers These ips theIntroduction Points Just sit There Being in Being normal Routed and Waiting here me I want to connect to this Hidden Service and Someone gaveMe the Onion Address so that's Really, what I need so what I do is I?Request The descriptor off the hash Table and it gives it back that has the Three ipAnd i pick one At random right let's Say This TopOne here what I'm going to do in Essence The Short VersionIs i'm going to ask this ip to Introduce me to a server and ThenWe're Going to meet in The Middle at someone [debut] Point that's the idea so let's Work out How it WorksI'Ve Sort of run out of colors so i'm going to go?Over the Orange Pen Here it's A bit bright I choose ARendezvous Point at Random and I create A [tour] Circuit to that Rendezvous Point Remember that Essentially all of These Arrows are the fullConnections This One has Two Hops on it not Three Because the Rendezvous Point is a third HopSo it Goes on like this Now I send a message to the one 7-Point Saying I'd like you to Introduce me [to] the serverBy This Introduction Point and I want you to send it the wordCookie Right now that Could Be Any string [it's] not Important [the] point Is sort of like a One-Time Password Kind of Thing to verifybut noOne Else has got Involved in This Conversation the Rendezvous Point Creates a circuit to this IP and sends it the Word Cookie itAlso sends its Own Address Because of Course this, doesn't know it because the Circuit and We [need] to be at a rendezvous Hereso this ipForwards The Cookie On to the Server and At this Point the Server Can Either Accept it and Decide to try and Make a ConnectionOr do Nothing right so you Can Imagine a situation where Instead of A cookie Some kind of special PasswordBut you need to be able to connect to this Website andThe Server Just Does Nothing that's that's One Thing that Could happen right They Have an Authentication Token I think but atThis Point the Introduction Points Job is done There is no moreThese Would be the serve Their Purpose all they do is Forward the Cookie [Onto] the server rightBear in Mind, We don't know where it Is andEat the server Decides Whether it's going to connectLet's Assume because Otherwise this willBe a much Shorter Video that the server does want to talk said he to the Rendezvous Point so it createsAnother Circuit I don't know How Many 1 2 3 4 5 but at[5] we've got [Six] Circuit right Across the Tor Network to the one David point Which is the cookie of The Wrong very Important Detailsyes That Rendezvous Point Details will beWell [it] be attached to the same message with the Cookie and yes Good Question nowThe Server Sends The One They've Appoint ARendezvous Please Essentially Message [Weave] the Cookie in it and the Mod Labelled Point Looks at These Two cookies and GoesWell I was requested of [One] They [blew] by this guy With this Cookie I've Received a Connection from some serverAlso with the cookie They must be Talking About each other right that's the Idea it Could be doing Lots of on the Moves atThe Same Time With Different Cookies and it will thenAct as Just Another Hop on This Network and Connect These two up so this Comes over here like this andThis Comes Down Here and They Kind of get Bridged by this Rendezvous Point here ConvenedOn the Rendezvous Point [Acts] like A normal [Onion] mu 2 and Just decrypt MessagesPasses Them out the other Side like Alwayssofor Anyone That's Sort of Lost countThere are atLeast six Hops here Right There Two intermediate Node on this Circuit then the Rendezvous Point in Three Intermediate Nodes onThis Circuit Right it's Just Part of the Protocol [that] There's only [Two] this Side that's Obviously going to be quite A lot slower thanNormal Talk These CouldBe all over the World like this it's going to Take quite a long TimeBut There is no real Way of getting in on this ConversationRight if You're Sniffing here or sniffing here all you're Seeing Is encrypted [tor] cells all of 512 bytes Long Jumping Around this PlaceShe's got, no Idea what any of Them are right very very difficult to track that's why, it's so difficult to findHidden Services okay Because They're Hidden yeah kind of the Point they, wouldn't Have Couldn't They?[did] Something Else no they did in TermThey Didn't Name it Incorrectly to SaySometimes Were Vulnerabilities Found in The Protocol right or Compromised knows Which Allow Hidden Services to be Found this happened for example Silk Road -But that's not [That] Common right and There's the bigger the Network Gets The more beautiful no Combinations are The heart of That Process GetsNow as an AsideSome Servers don't need Anonymity and this Many hops is too slow [all] right so they want to protect Their Clients butThey don't Care About but if People know who they are Facebook for example so Facebook WorkFoot-Tall Recently to Introduce Something Called Single Onion in That case the only Difference is the bit ServerDoesn't bother With These Three hops it just goes straight to the Rendezvous PointNow That Obviously [Forgoes]Servers Anonymity Because [The] One Living Point knows what it Is but it Takes a puppyWe know [Whether] servers are I think right so they don't mind about that Their Business Is protecting Their CustomersThey don't Care but We know Where Their servers are so that's an Alternative and you it's quite A lot faster because you've Removed ThreePossibly Global Hops from There What Benefit Is [that] Facebook - you know some of Just using A normal torConnection Facebook There's a small Chance if You're using a normal tor Connection that some will be Sniffing Here and Sniffing Here and do TrafficCorrelation and Work out what's going on?Right [There's] no chance About happening when it's a hidden server it Never leaves the Tor Network that's the thing if you Imagine that CloudYou're Talking to Facebook Entirely Inside That Cloud very Hard to get in but on the other HandFacebook Server Location is Actually Known because if youWere Operating the Rendezvous Point and Facebook said we'd like to connect back to the Client you'd immediately know that Because it's [Facebook's] Server soit's like a Halfway CompromiseAnd i think a fairly reasonable Compromise so it's Facebook Putting one Foot, Inside the Cloud yeah yeah one FootInside did to Talk LoudWith messages Encrypted Once With K3 it's encrypted Another Time with K2 andWhen it's encrypted a final TimeWith K1 Now Let's Think about what that means it Means that only This Routes are Here",

   "title": "SHA: Secure Hashing Algorithm - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "11 Apr 2017",
   "transcription": "SHA stands for the secure hash algorithm. Which is interesting given that it has just kind of been brokenBut I'm not going to talk specifically about the attack on SHA todaythat's for a different video, butWhat I wanted to do was talk in a little bit more detail about hash functions and what they areAnd how SHA in particular works so you can get an idea of a kind of way these things are implementedlet's have a quick look at what a hash function is briefly because Tom's got somebody covered it in this video andHe's gone into a lot of the reasons you might use a hash function. The kind of hash functionsI'm talking about are not the ones that we've been talking about forHashing passwords. Those ones have to be quite slow in some sense because you need them to be secureWe're going to talk mostly about the hash functions that are used routinely in cryptography for things like message authenticationDigital signatures, and so on. So they need to be fairly quick, both to verify and compute. A hash functionTake some string, right, let's say \"abc\" and it turns it into some fixed length string(that's not usually three long) of randomSo we know a bit string right, but so so you, 011001011...Go forward this way for however many bits that hash function is. Now, there's a few important properties of Hash functionsThat we care about for cryptography, but the most important one perhaps. Is that it's essentially pseudo-randomSo that means that we put in \"abc\"And we get out something that is in no way like \"abc\" and appears completely random to us and if we change this even slightlyBecause it's appearing random this has completely changedSo let's have a quick look at SHA-1 as an example just so we can see this in actionI'm on some page that has a script that calculates hashes on the fly so I can put in \"abc\" andYou can see that the hash is a9993e and so on all the way up to d, right?This is the SHA1 hash. A SHA1 hash is 160 bits long. If I change thisC to a D the hash is completely changed. So there's the appearance of randomness - the idea thatThis hash is actually not related to this at allEven though it is and we know it is because if I put C back againWe're back to a9993So we can use this to verify messages haven't been changed or verify signatures on certificatesAnd we can do it knowing that we have the appearance of randomness , but actually it's not random at all. TodayWe're going to talk a bit about how you actually write a hash function to do thisHow do we take something that essentially isn't random with a very known structure and turn it into something that looks like nonsenseSuch that we can use it. Now,There'll be people raising a few eyebrows thatI'm using SHA1 as an example to do thisBut actually there's fairly reasonable reason to do so.First of all you know we might also talk about the weaknesses at some pointbut also SHA-1 bears a striking similarity in structure to MD4 and MD5 which is see a lot of use historically andSHA-256 and SHA-512 which is a SHA2Which currently is in some sense a standard that everyone uses right SHA3 is quite differentAnd that's is something else for another daySo SHA1 was developed by the NSAAnd released and published in 1995 now a lot of people don't trust things that the NSA do sort of by defaultWhich might be fair, but in this case actually SHA1 was quite good for a long long timewhen there were some concerns ... recently much more serious concerns, butOriginally the NSA weren't doing it as a back door and stuff the NSA need cryptographyJust like everyone else and this is a good functionMD5 had a lot of problems and so what they basically did was extend it and make it betterSHA1 takes any length of string and outputs a160 bit value. Alright, so that's160 zeros and ones. The question then becomes: I've got a string but could be \"abc\" or it could be an incredibly long file orYou know a whole movie right, and I want to calculate 160-bit signature of thatHow do I even get started doing that well the answer is that I basically have a loop that takes512 bit blocks of data one at a time until the file's expended. Let's look at an example of how SHA1 works on justa single message of exactly the right lengthAnd then we'll just talk briefly about what you do when inevitably isn't the right lengthWhich is almost always, right? So SHA1 takes a message of n blocks of 512 bits in length, andIf it's only one block - if the message is exactly 512 bits in length, then we only run it once, in essenceAnd then we out put the hash at the end so SHA-1Starts with an internal state then we bring in bits of our message one at a timeAnd we change that internal state and after we've done that at the very end when there's no more message leftWe just read what the internal state is and that's our hash alrightso we're going to basically be taking the internal state and updating it with the message untilWe run out of message, and then as soon as that process stops we can read the resultsThat's how the SHA family of hash functions works, so our internal state we call H so I'm going to say H0H1 H2 H3and H4Now the internal state of SHA1 is exactly the same length as the hash that it produces. Which is 160 bits. Which is five32-bit words four bytes each you know for 32-bit machine this would be an intSo this is initialized based on some constants. Which is defined in the standardWe might talk about that in a bitbut it's not very important and what we're going to do is we're update these h's asWe bring in our message and then at the end. We'll see what the Hs are and that's our hash functionSo how do we do this? Well? We have something [called] a compression function?It's going to take in this data and a bit of messageTurn it into another set of h values and that's going to repeat as we have messageBut that's only going to happen once this time because my message is exactly 5 12, which is very handySo this is our compression functionAnd I'm going to rename these slightly just to confuse everyone to ABc dearly so at the beginning of our compression functionWe copy B's the internal state into a b c d and eWe then perform 80 rounds of char compression function, right?Which is like this so x 80 now what that's going to do is take in words from our512 bit block of our message, so if this is our message here that message is512 bits this is going to come in at this point and be mixed in with this ABc and D so well for nowWe won't talk about exactly what's going on in this compression functionBut the idea is that the bits of abcde are being combined together? They're being shuffledThey're being commuted around to make it look more and more random as we go and at the same timeWe're bringing in bits from this message to further increase the appearance of mandamusBut also to make sure that this shower function is calculating a digest on this specific message rather than just a general oneThat's the same every time for this message. We're always going to perform the exact same algorithmSo if we put in this message a second time the shower function will produce exactly the same resultNow once we've done this and we shuffled up abcde will be left with a newAbcde so a b c d and eAnd then we finish this block by bringing our h values down here and adding [them] to these values hereto create a newH naughtH1 H2 H3H4 the State is now been updated by whatever we did in this compression function by just adding to it all right now all additionIn Char is done without any overflow modulo 2 to the 32 well that means is that if you ever go over?The maximum value allowed by a 4-byte integer you lap back around againRight which is one of the reasons why shark arm in reverse because you might lose information that wayThis is not encryption. We don't need to be able to reverse it, so this state isFinished now if our message is exactly 512 bitsWe need these 18 or h1 h2 h3 h4 values out that is our hash, so for short messages. We're doneI could just you know go homein actual fact the the principle of extending this to arbitrary length messages right in increments of512 Bits isWe copy this state back up to the top and we repeat the process and then we copy back up and we repeat the processFor as many blocks as we have of our message 512 bits at a time of our messageWe feed it in we alter the state using this approach here, and then we lead off a state when we're done, right?That's basically how it worksSo be the security of SHA is all in this compression function and what it's doing. If it's shorter than that, whathappens there?  If it's not a multiple of 512 bits. We're going to have to do some padding right?Char only works with 512 bit blocks, so what we do is if we have our message. Which is let's say1 0 1 1 0 1 it's not a very long message. If we want to pad that up to 512 bitsWe start with [a] one. We pad with 11 [alright], so I'm going to sort of mark, de-mark the padding hereso we know we go with0000 and then we finish off the message with the length of the actual message in itSo we know where to sort of remove the padding which in this case is 7 so in Binary 1 1 1 so 1 11?Obviously would a lot more bits for your length than I have done. You get the idea now this padding schemeEnsures that messages of the same length and messages that end in the same way or in very similar ways don't share the same paddingAnd don't end up being the same that's very important, so this approach to SHA [its] repetitiveUpdating of the internal state with a compression function in essence is called a merkel down guard constructionThis was sort of independently proved by murkland damn. [God]But essentially what's good about it is if your compression function is good and has good pSeudo-random properties then so does your shower functionWhich is of course very useful right?The problem is that the compression function of char one is not so good that the attacks areTo the 18 they can be reduced somewhat to about 2 to the 60 something like this which it becomesInto the realm of possibility for people with a lot of money",

   "title": "Man in the Middle Attacks & Superfish - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "23 Oct 2015",
   "transcription": "Did you hear about superfish this year?[Sean] Yes. This is the Lenovo laptop scandal, isn't it?Yeah this is the bit of software that was installed on pretty much every consumer Lenovo laptop.It was so bad that the US department of homeland security issued an advisory saying that this needs to be uninstalled.And to understand why it's so bad we need to understand Man In The Middle attacks.There have been a lot of techniques for intercepting traffic for a long long time.One of the earliest ones I remember was called ARP spoofing or ARP poisoning.You've got your router sitting in the middle.  Cause all routers have a little aerial and some lights on them.And you've got computers connected to this.And what you do is you bring your computer onto an open Wi-Fi network, something like that,connect your computer, and your computer just announces, \"Hello!  I'm now the router.\"I'm simplifying massively here but basically the network is built on trust.And so the computers just kind of believe it.And so the computers and the router and sending all their packets to you first and then you're forwarding them on to the right locations.So everything's going through you.  10 or 15 years ago this was terrible because pretty much everything was sent in plain text.Email passwords, websites, everything was going through plain text.So you could just sit thereand provided your computer was fast enough, your network card was good enough,you could see every bit of traffic on this network and just kind of slurp all the password out.Obviously massively illegal without the consent of everyone on the network so Don't do that!Umm, but the solution to that is SSL.Your computer sitting here, and the server out here.  As all servers look like computers from the 1990s.Your computer sends requests saying \"Hello, I would like to talk securely.\"\"These are the protocols I can support. These are my details.\"And the server comes back, \"Yeah, okay.  Here's my public key.\"I know Computerphile has done, you've done public and private key before.-Yeah, he's sat behind me.So yeah, go watch his video about public and private key cryptography if you want to know the details about that.Basically the server sends back a long series of numbers.  Your computer can sign messages with these and encrypt messages with these.And they can only be unlocked by that server because maths.I'm not going to try to explain more than that.You can lock messages, only they can unlock them.Which is great because your attacker, who is sitting in the middle here, and reading everything will just see noise.Except all we've really done is just moved the problem back a stagebecause that first bit, that \"Hello, I would like to talk securely.\" \"Yeah okay. Here's my private (sic. meant \"public\") key.\"  That has to go in plain text.And someone in the middle can change that.They can take that public key that was sent by the server and just go,\"Um, no.  I'm going to have that! Here's my public key instead.\"  You're actually going here, and then here.Your computer here doesn't know the difference.It then encrypts the message with the attacker's public key. Sends it back here.Attacker opens it. Decrypts it.  Reads it.Goes \"okay.\" and then sends the message that should have been sent from your computer all properly encrypted.Server goes, \"All right, we've got an encrypted connection going on here.\" Sends the encrypted packet.The attacker, who can do this now, unlocks it, goes \"yeah, all right,\"and then re-encrypts it with their key, sends it on to you and now every single communication is going through the attacker.No one knows anything is wrong. That is your classic Man In The Middle attack.The solution to this is something called signed certificates.This is why setting up a secure server on the web costs a little bit of money right now.I mean it may not in the future.The Electronic Frontier Foundation and Mozilla and trying to set up a thing to make this free.Hopefully by the end of the year it will be.But the idea is that there's a third party vouching for the set of the public keys you're exchanging.I've had to do this.I set up a secure server about a year ago now.What I had to do when I was setting it up I had to write \"It's going to run this website, it's going to be on this address, it's going to use these protocols\"and they would generate this set of public and private keys.And then over an existing secure connection, one that I knew to be good, I send that private key off to something that is called a certifi-How do I draw a certificate authority?[Sean] I think it's going to be a faceless office.  Or why don't we do a factory then we know that's kind of indus...Haha, we're going to the Internet factory, there we go.Factory of the Internet, all right, there we go, we got a padlock factory there.No no, it's not a padlock.  I've drawn a padlock here, it's not.It's a set of keys.  It's what we call public and private keys.I generate my keys. I make them. And I send them over a connection I know to be secure to this company.There's like half a dozen big ones in the world. Maybe 50 or 100 or so small regional ones.And what they do is they check, all right these keys we've got.  Are they definitely from this server? Yes.And if you want one of the green padlocks with your company name on it they ask you to,I don't know, fax something on headed paper, something like that. It's probably still a fax machine actually,which is why it's so expensive, know you, to keep the fax machine running.They get this.  They check it's coming from the right server.They check it's the right keys.And then they do maths to them.And now those keys are now signed by that company with their own private key, which no one else has.So now, when I do that initial back and worth, so person comes along, they talk to my server, and they say \"Hello. I would like to talk securely.\"And my server says, \"All right. Here is my public key. It's been signed by those folks over there.\"And the company says, \"Ah! Oh yeah, okay! That's great.\"And if the attacker changes one bit of those keys, - in the computer sense -, one 1 or 0 in there, the maths doesn't add up any more.And more than that, not only does the maths not add up, they can't generate any new keys and sign them because they don't have the private key for any of these big companies.So the attacker's completely out of luck.If they change it, it'd be like when you try logging into a public wi-fi network, it pops up \"Hey! You need to log in.  We need your details.\"Sometimes that's a man in the middle attackand they are taking stuff you are trying to send to the server. And they're getting in the way and sending, \"no we're going to send back our page instead.\"This warning will pop up and say \"we're meant to be on a secure connection to Gmail but we're not! YWAA! <panic sound>. Panic everyone run. Big red screen.\"Which of course now most people have now trained themselves to click through, but you know, you try.Okay, the attacker can't intercept the keys any more. Not without sending up all sorts of red flags, which is fine.But again all we've done is we've moved the problem back a stage because how do you know which certificate authorities to trust?And that's when for end users, for people like you and me web browsing, when you do have to take it on trust.Because when you bought your smart phone- when I bought this I trusted Apple.They installed a list of maybe probably about 100 certificate authorities, those factories on there.They installed their public keys on there.So they don't really go over the air to start with. They're pre-installed with your device.If you install a web browser, that would be over a connection you know to be secure or hopefully. And you install that and say \"Right, I'm trusting these companies because my browser manufacturer trusts them.\"It's okay, we now have keys on this server signed by the factory here.And that factory is trusted by whoever made your browser or your device.So we have this complete network of trust that's set up.That means the attacker can't change the keys. And there are two obvious weak points there.One is the certificate authority.If you can get them to fraudulently sign keys then all the people who trust them are completely out of luck.And that happened, that happened to a Dutch certificate authority that is now bankrupt because no one trusts them.Somehow they got conned, coerced, bribed, no one knows, but they generated a completely valid, signed certificate for Google.They had no right to do that, no permission to do that but they generated a certificate for the whole of Google with their signature on it saying, \"We trust this.\"And that somehow made it to Iran where someone manage a massive man in the middle attack on enormous numbers of Iranian web users.So they were all seeing a big green padlock with \"Google\" written in it.If they looked at the details, which a couple of people - if you're paranoid, you check the details on this.And someone is asking \"Why is this certificate for Google signed by someone in the Netherlands? That doesn't make sense.\" And that was how it was found out.That wasn't a genuine Google certificate.But most people wouldn't know that.They're talking to Gmail. They're seeing a big green Google certificate in there. They think all's well.- So they're basically looking at their Gmail emails, but it's all going through somewhere else.It's all going through an attacker.  The keys that are being replace, they couldn't do it for every website, but they've done it for this one, they've done it for Google.So every bit of Google traffic that went through them, they were swapping out the keys.They were opening everything, looking at it, all this is all happening in milliseconds obviously. Open it.  Store it. Put the new keys on it that you've got. Send it onwards.And it's terrible. It's a devastating attack if you can pull it off.And there is a genuine concern that governments can do this.That governments can go to certificate authorities and say, \"Right. This is the government here. We need you to generate some fake certificates.\"Or they can just steal the private keys.If they can steal the certificate authority's private keys, they can generate their own keys without even the authority knowing.I mean, it's a devastating attack if they can pull it off.Can they?I'd be surprised if the NSA couldn't do that somehow.Whether they actually choose to do it is another matter.Because if they do, and it gets found out, not only have they bankrupted a fairly major company, that no one trusts any more, but they've blown their cover.So I suspect that yeah they can do it, but they use it in very very rare situations where they haven't got another option.Whether they should, I'm not getting into that debate.That's one weak spot.  The other is the list of trusted authorities on your phone or on your computer.Because if an attacker can get an extra entry in there, if they can get themselves in there, then they can just generate new keys on the fly and every single connection would be intercepted.So that's what Superfish did.They wanted to insert advertising.Superfish was a program that took your Google searches and added a little bit more advertising in it for them, which is a terrible idea!But Google switched to secure searching for everyone.So Superfish, which is such a bad idea, they installed themselves as a trusted certificate provider.And it wasn't even sitting out in the networks, it was this little program sitting on your own computer looking at all your traffic and doing a man in the middle attack on it and inserting their own adverts.That authority is sitting on your computer signing keys on the fly.Which means that the private key, the numbers that should never ever be seen,is sitting on your computer and can be extracted.It was the same on every single computer so as soon as one attacker pulled it off one computer, every single installation is vulnerable, because every single computer that has superfish trusts superfish.So if someone in the middle pretends to be superfish, which they can do because they have that private key,then that attacker can man in the middle every single secure website out there.And they know you've got it because they can see Lenovo on the back of your computer in the coffee shop.There's ways, there's uninstallers out there now. Lenovo promised not to do it again. Superfish, as far as I know, does not exist as a bit of software any more.But it's one short-sighted company that used every ignorant shortcut in the book to try to make a few adverts appear.Just because of that, tens of thousands maybe hundreds of thousands of computers, I don't know, perhaps a million, I don't know how many they make in a year.But all those were made vulnerable to a really really terrible attackjust because one company wanted to sell a few ads.And it's very very difficult for people who go into a bad place and use a card because if you complain to your bank then the strip club owner will just say,\"He was with four girls all night, and four thousand pounds is what that costs at our place.\"How long have we not been recording?That's a really good question.This is because I'm an idiot.I love it. We're three quarters of the way through and he says, \"Why are we not recording?\"We did that for the drone footage in Chernobyl. We had a monitor on the drone footage with a remote link.And we're getting our shots.  And I look in and go\"Our GoPro is not rolling. Oh!\"Bring the drone back down. Change the battery in the drone. Oh man!",

   "publishedAt": "17 Jun 2015",
   "transcription": "in a very basic sense if you've got ageneral intelligence which therefore haspreferences over world statesand take actions in the world to changethe worldwe have to make sure that itspreferences are aligned with oursthat it wants what we want.because otherwise it's gonna try and do thingsthat we don't want it to do.that's the basic idea...(sci-fi comes to the fore we're talking things like terminator, matrix,that machines take over the worldI for one salute our new robot overlords)it makes it difficult to think about the problem right?when things happen in fiction it'sgenerally what would make a better storyrather than what would actually happenand I think aa realistic \"AI takes over the world\"-typestorymight not be any fun to read. So on theone sidethis stuff is difficult to think aboutbecause of fiction, because we've all beenexposed to something similar to theseideas beforethe other side that makes this difficultto think about is anthropomorphismbecause we are talking about generalintelligenceso we're going to compare it to theexamples in general intelligence that wehavewhich is human minds and human minds and artificial general intelligencesneed not beanything alikein the same way that a plane is notsimilar to a birda supersonic fighter jet is a threat toyou in a way thatno bird is. It's not a useful comparison tomake in factbut when you say oh it's a thing it haswings and it flies and peoplewho don't know anything about planes immediatelyto go to birds(presumably machine could be much more selfish thanwe can ever imagine)absolutely, the space of minds in general is vastI like this because we've already talkedabout spaces so I can do this. If youtake the space at all possible mindsit's huge and then it somewhere withinthat, you have the space of all mindsthat biological evolution can produceand that's also huge somewhere withinthat you have the space ofactual minds that exist which is muchsmaller but still hugewithin that, you've got human minds rightand they're a tiny, they're aminuscule dot on a minuscule dot on aminuscule dot of theactual possibilities for intelligencethat exist anda general intelligence that we create isfrom a completely different part of thespaceand it's extremely tempting to anthropomorphisemore so even than in another contextbecauseit's a thing that's demonstrablyintelligent that makes plans that takesactions in the real worldbut it need not thinkanything like us and it's a mistake tothink a bitas basically a person because it isn't one.So there's actually really good examplethat we can use. It's sort of a thoughtexperimentThis is not a machine that couldpractically speaking be builtthis is an example of at artificialgeneral intelligencewhich is specified an overviewand it gives you something to thinkabout when you're thinking aboutartificial general intelligences thatmakes it distinct froma sort of anthropomorphized human typeintelligenceSo the story is there's aa stamp collector who is also an AIprogrammer and he decides he would like tocollect a lot more stampsso he's gonna write an AI to do thisfor him. So he builds a machinehe has some startling insight intogeneral intelligence and he builds thismachinewhich is connected to the Internet,right?so the the rules for this system arepretty straightforward. first thing, it'sconnected to the Internet and it willsend and receive datafor one year. So, he's given himself aone-year timewindow within which to collect stampsthe second thing isit has an internal model of reality , ofthe universethis is the thing that's a bit magic wedon't really know how to build anaccuratemodel of reality. The point is thisallows it tomake accurate predictions about whatwill happen if it does different thingsthe third thing is for every possiblesequence of packets it could sendit uses its model to predicthow many stamps it ends up with at theend of that and thenthe fourth thing is it outputs as itsactual data to the Internetwhichever output it has predicted willproduce the most stampsyou can see herethat this has all the properties of ageneral intelligenceit has an internal model of reality. Ithasa utility function or an evaluationfunction, which is the number of stamps,and the optimization isextremely simple and like so much incomputer science therethe simple things to specify are the hardthings to computeit looks at every possible output datain other words everyevery point in that space and it picksoutthe highest one. So this is a kind of magicintelligencethat takes the entire space at oncefinds the highest point and saysthat one. Which means it's anextremely powerful intelligenceright it is you could say it's extremelyintelligentthe question is how does this machinebehave? Well, we can look at certainpossible sequences of outputsand see how they fare in it's evaluationcriteria.first off,  the vast majority of outputsequences are complete junkright it's spewing random data on to thenetwork. nothing happensof any consequence.No stamps get collected. Those are all rated zero.but suppose one of the possiblesequencesa sends a request to a server let's sayeBay, that results in a bid on some stamps,right? When that happens, there's a thing of 20 stampsso that output is rated 20. This is the kind of thing thatthe stamp collector machine's creatorwas expecting to happenSo then that's good, 20 stampssuppose it could do that lots of times.it could send out bids for example to30 different stamp collectors on eBayand buy 30 sets of different stampsand that's even better, right? That would be rated even higher, but the thing is thatparticularly highly rated options inthis search spaceare probably things that thestamp collecting device's creator did notthink ofand did not anticipate. So for examplewhen he made it, he will have presumably givenit his credit card details or something sothey could engage in these bidsbut ultimately it's searching everypossible sequence of outputs. It needn't usehis credit cardit needn't use money at all. There'sa huge variety of things that it could do here.So it might send out an enormous number ofemails to all the stamp collectors in theworldand convince them through persuasiveargument thathe is opening a museum and wants toexhibit their stampsIt may build a fake website for thatwhatever is necessaryit can predict the world, right. It has aninternal model of reality that internalmodel of realityincludes the people right. In the sameway that its modelingpeople to understand that if it bidson thisoffer, then a human being will mail thestamps to them. They understand thisemail might get more people to sendstamps for example that somethingbut then what exactly is a stamp? How is this defined?What counts as a stamp?if it's already written the sequence of outputs that collectsall of the stamps in the world you thinkyou're done, right? You built this machinesuddenly is collected all the stamps inthe world.No, there could be more stamps within a year.We've got time to print more stampsso maybe it hijacks the world's stamp printingfactories and puts them into overdriveproducing stampsas many as you possibly can in that timeor perhapsit writes a virus and it hijacks allthe computers in the world to get all ofthe printers in the world to do nothingbut print stamps.that's even better right?The highest-ratedoutcomes for this machine are not good for peopleThere comes a point when the stampcollecting devices thinkingokay what are stamps made of?they're made of paper. Paper is made of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen.I'm gonna need all of that I can get tomake stampsand its gonna notice that people aremade of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygenright. There comes a point where thestamp collecting device becomesextremely dangerousand that point is as soon as you switchit on.So this is just a thought experiment example where we take a sort of maximally powerful intelligenceand see how it behaves so that we canthink abouthow powerful intelligence has behavedand most importantlyhow they are not like people",

   "title": "A* (A Star) Search Algorithm - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "15 Feb 2017",
   "transcription": "In the last video, if I remembercorrectly 'cause it was a good month ago now.I drew a graph out and weworked through it with Dijkstra, and at the endI pointed out a couple of problems.So let's just remind ourselves aboutthose problems and then when we'll talk about A starwe can see how it addresses it.The problem is with Dijkstra that it will followthe path currently shortest and that -- anddoesn't pay any attention to whatdirection it's going.So if i'm coming down here to my end goal,and I'm starting up here, that's fine ifthe weights are all the same because it willlook at it up here and there, but I'llget there quite quick.The problem is of course if you've gotthe map of the UK and it's searching quicklydown all nice motorways when infact actually we don't need to go downthe motorways because it's a country road driveor something like this. Now, course inpractice, it wouldn't take very longstill because your computer is quite fastbut the whole point of these algorithmsis they're quick and you can imagine if you'rewriting a sat-nav, you don't want it totake a long time churning for the roads unnecessarily.The other problem is,if your graph doesn't look like a map because,you know, in some sense the UK road networkisn't quite sparse but the most of thecountry doesn't have a road on it. It'smostly fields and sheep and stuff. But,you know, all houses. If you have asituation where you've got a quite adense network like this, so I guess youcould say a bit like Manhattan. But also just,you know, another problem where yourgraph structure is different. So ifyou're looking through an image orsomething like this. I'm starting up hereand cross that out. There we are and I'mfinishing down,I don't know... here. Let's remember thatDijkstra follows the shortest path basedon the distance of each of these. Now, ifit is just a uniform grid, let'ssay, we have no interesting informationto provide for these weights and allthese weights say one so it's justgonna to flood fill from here. It's gonnago here, and then here and then tothese three and then to these four, and so on andthat's not very optimal. Especiallyif we just literally want to gostraight down here, like this. So we want tobuild in some kind of idea of, but notnecessarily the direction we're heading but we areat least going towards our goal, so we canaim for it. And that's what A star does.A star is basically a small extension toDijkstra that builds in a heuristic thatsays we're getting a bit closer.This is our nice screwed up graph from last timeand this is our nice new fresh graphthat I've done which is, topologically exactlythe same. I may have traced it. So, wecould do Dijkstra on this.I've got my little cards for my priority queue.I've reminded myself how the end condition isso I can end it properly.That's all fine. What we want to do is extend thisto A star. Now, A star is basically exactly thesame as Dijkstra, except it has anadditional heuristic that is how far dowe have to go. And, in this case,a pretty reasonable heuristic to come up withwill be literal Euclidean distanceof how far we have to go. So, in this caseS to E will be that far, C to E will be that far.And so on. I couldn't think of a good way ofcalculating this without literally justmeasuring it. So I got my, got my...dainty 10 meter tape measure,which is a little bit overkill. But we'll,you know, make it work. So this is all a bit odd.I don't use tape measures as much as you canimagine 'cause I mostly sit at a deskand do typing. This is a tape measure incentimeters and inches. Let's use inches today.Alright.Imperial, woo. So I'm gonna literallymeasure the amount of inches from S to E,and then A to E, and then I'm just gonna putthis on here now. And this is whereyou fast forward. So, I'm gonna use it,the black pen for this. So let's say this is 10.There. This is harder than I thought it would be.I haven't got enough hands.8... 6... I'm rounding up a bitit's not very accurate. 4... So the greenones are our step distances from Dijkstra and theblack ones are measured inches.Also 3, 6, 7. We're getting there. 6 again.Alright. That's me doing my workman's... Now:we've got exactly the same graph as before but now wehave some measure of the distance to our thing.It's not a very good heuristic ina sense that my measuring is not veryaccurate and for A star to work reallywell, you have to have a consistentmetric and you have to, notoverestimate how far you've got to go.Things like this... But, we'll justhope it works, sort of work itself out....You know, it can't be any worse than meyou know, doing it by hand anyway. So, recallwhen we did Dijkstra. What we had was we hadsome queue here like this. These had the currentdistance from the start to these nodes.And if one of the nodes had ashorter path, it would move up the queue andthen when we wanted to expand a node we take itoff the queue. A star works exactly thesame way, except the distance isn't whatwe ordered them by anymore. It's adistance of the path plus how far theyhave to go.so for example. B, the distance isgoing to be 2 plus 7 which is 9. Alright.So B will have a value of 9 on this queue.And the idea is that if something has along way to go,it's going to receive a higher weightand be further down the queue andexpanded later. What it will do isprioritize nodes, that are going roughlyin the right direction, unless... I mean it willstill go down really good paths, reallyshort paths. But not at the expense ofeverything else, it's the idea.OK, so let's run through this just like we didwith Dijkstra and hopefully I won't makeany mistakes. People will very kindlypoint them out if I do. Oh look, look. Checkered flag.This is why I don't draw things, becauseit's not it's never good... Right,okay, we're starting at S. I'm not going todraw the infinity symbols on because weknow that all of these nodes start witha distance of infinity because wedon't know how far the path is. In Dijkstra,we store the distance to each path, andwe also ordered by that distance. We'venow got two separate measures we'remeasuring in A star: one is the distanceto the node, and one is the distance toa node and any remaining distance. So, wekind of need to have two values on eachof these things. So I'm going to try andkeep the colors the same so that wedon't lose track.So anything I draw in green isgoing to be this 'g' cost function whichis the distance to a current node,so for C that would be 3.And then, in black I'm going to have 3plus 8 which is the sort of combinedcost; the thing we're actually ordering by.OK, so the path cost to S is 0 and the sortof distance to go is 10, but it won'tmatter because S is the only thing inour queue. So we'll put S in the queue but everythingelse have a distance to infinity. Solet's start expanding some stuff. So Afirst. A has... I gotta find A mate. Fast forward.Oh here we are.Why aren't these in alphabetical order?I mean, you know... What was I thinking?Right, so A has a distance of 7 and a combineddistance of 9 plus 7 which is 16. Thesame for B. Same B, B, B... Again B.I mean it's actually at the end.Unbelievable. So I'm gonnakeep seeing it at the top now 'cause I knowthat's coming.OK, so B has a weight of 2 and acombined cost of 7 plus 2, which is 9.So, I'm gonna put that in there. Now, B goes inthe queue and goes ahead of A, because9 is smaller than 16, right. We'rekeeping a track of these green distances.We're not actually using them to see which onecomes next. And then C. C has a pathcost of 3 and then a combined weightof 11. 8 plus 3. And then that goes injust above A like this, right. Soactually, so far, pretty similar to Dijkstra,apart all the numbers are changed. So what's next.We start expanding B. I haven't beenkeeping track of the previous node soall of these currently there's the stormin red all are going through Sat the moment.OK, so B next. We can go to A. A has adistance of seven when we decidingwhether the path to A better via Bwe don't care about this heuristic,we only care about the actual cost of it,the path to A, so in this case 2 + 3 isless than 7 just like with Dijkstrawe're going to replace it so A, its new weightis going to be 5, and 16 is going tobe 5 + 9, so 14, right? And this now,this path is going through B, not..Do you think I can turn this into a B?Oh yes, there we go, look at that.So it stays below C, it's not a big deal.OK, D... Let's find in my shuffled list.If you're implement this, don't shuffle it becauseit'll be a lot harder to find in memoryRight, there we are. B has a path length of 2D has a path length of 4, so that's a path length of 6and D has got a distance of 8 to the end soactually you can see here that D istraveling forward in this direction, but is actuallygetting further away than B so thesegoing to be quite heavily penalizedthat's our hope so D is not going to beexpanded for a while we're going to lookthere until it's a last resortSo 8 + 4 is 12, and that path goes through...You know what, I'm just gonna leave the lids off.And that goes through B. So put that in.And that goes above A because A is a terrible one,remember there's a fallen tree on that one,but it still could be back and thenfinally H. Now, H has a path length of 1 which isnice and quick, B has a path length of 2 sothe total path cost is 3 and theactual heuristic cost is 3 plus 6 whichis 9, that's 9 in here, 9 is lookingpretty good right now.Now H goes straight above everythinglike this, right?B is about to pop out so that's good.So B is finished, and we put B on our finished pack.Huh, finished stack... Finished list?Finished data structure over here.Next up is H, right? Now,last time we didn't expand H next,we expanded C next in Dijkstra becausethey had the same rough paths cost whichis 3 and C was already in the list sonow we already started to move a little bitfaster with A star which is good becauseit means my example is working so H comes offand let's see where we can gowe could go to F, so that's easy, I'll find FF has a past of 3 + 3which is 6 and it has a distance to goof 6, so that's a total heuristic cost of 12and it's going through H. Right, this goes inand it will come in behind D here with apath cost also of 12, right, in generalif there's a conflict will just put the first on inyou know, depends on your implementationG has a path cost of 3 from H plus another2 so that's 5 and then plus another 3 is 8.Ok, we're done with HG goes in right to the top which is goodnews for us, for our nice elegant search.So we're going to expand G, so where's E?But I'm not gonna go off half-cocked this timeand finish my algorithm here. G has a pathlength of 5 and so E has a path lengthof 7see now I've drawn this checkered flag andit's in the way of my numbers, thanks forthe suggestion there. Right, E has aheuristic cost of zero because we're atthe goal so actually 7 is the finalvalue that we get given here and thisgoes through G and we're going toput E in, so E goes in hereG is not really on the stack anymore.G can't expand anywhere else, we've alreadybeen to H and so the next iteration of thealgorithm starts, right? We popping off thetopwe're about to expand it and we realizethat's where we're going and we finishedour algorithmok so then just like before we traceback through so E goes to G and then...Where's my G? There it is. And G goes to H,and then H goes to B,and B goes to S, and S is the start, alright?So we've got our path, S-B-H-G-ENow in this case it's exactly the same pathas Dijkstra becauseI picked a fairly reasonable heuristic, right?Plus or minus a bit of my dodgy measuringBut you can see we didn't bother to expandC or L or even consider I and J many fewernodes got put in the stack...In both termsof the amount of computation we did andthe memory footprint was reduced and westill obtained the same result.So there were one or two comments on the lastvideo about not expanding those butyou're saying that on A star youdefinitely don't have to expand those,No. The comments on the video werebecause basically I forgot to waituntil E was expanded to finish, I gotoverexcited and as soon as I saw E,I declared it over when we went and gotcoffee and yeah and that's not rightbecause technically speaking there couldhave been a path from say, F to E, thatwas super-sneaky and really quick, right?I'm sorry, super-sneaky is not a technicalterm you see in the literature, and ifthat had happened we have to wait untilE bubbles to the top of our priorityqueue to be able to know for sure that we've gotthe shortest path. In this case it wasvery straightforward, E went straight tothe top, but you can never guarantee and adifferent graph will have a differentthingso the actual stopping criterion forboth Dijkstra and A star is when your goalnode gets to the top of your priority queue.But yeah that was good that people pointed that outbecause it completed the video with abit of extra comments. To wrap up you canimagine now that we've seen a video onhow that works in terms of GPS positionsand we've seen a couple of videos onpathfinding and there's lots of videos on datastructures in this you can imagine nowthat you might start to think i canactually not see how that might beimplemented I could see you know theparts of the system that have to work togetherwe've got a map that stored in thememorywe've got nodes that we're trying to getto and from, that we've got an algorithmthat will find a way throughNow, you can imagine also that it'sunrealistic to expect a small sat-navto completely compute its way through theUK but if you saw \"I what the best pathfrom Land's End to John O'Groats\" youmight melt your sat-nav unless you dosomething a little bit smarter so youcan imagine they might precompute someof these things but they know theshortest way of getting from Nottinghaminto London is via the M1 orsomething like thisto sort of hard code some of it in some senseto be honestI don't work for a sat-nav company, I don'tknow what their proprietary algorithmsare, but you can see this is the kind ofthing we're doing we're trying to find anice elegant way of getting from A to Band there's lots of pathfinding algorithmsand you could come up with lots ofinteresting heuristics, not just euclidean distanceAlso of course they're going tohave a GPS to measure up in your datingthat I mean yet although i would say VPSoften has an accuracy of possibles fewmeters so it was shoddy measuring tapeis actually pinpoint precision comparedto that still have maps are carefullycrafted would be exact known positionsof all these junctions and they know howlong it takes to travel out theroundabout and they know how long ittakes because of traffic and think aboutthis they're going to be doing a lotsmarter or albums and i'm doing but thisis a start and you can see you couldbuild this up into a really good system",

organic matrix does thematrix of course itself which is areally really intriguing idea reallyintelligent concept let down by some theearth or acting it's a fascinatingconcept for anybody are we living in asimulation and it stretches all the wayback it's a philosophical a thornyphilosophical issue so there's a wholesort of subfield of physics now calleddigital physics where physicists andcomputer scientists are getting togetherand the idea is that the fundamentalbasis of reality the fundamental basisof physics is not energy it's not matterits information and there's a guy calledJohn Wheeler back in the 70s that iswonderful phrase called it from bit themost fundamental aspect of our realityis information this is physics worldback in just last year modeling ouruniverse is a giant computer and theidea here is that instead of havingwhat's called continuous functionsinstead of being able to basically pickany particular point in space no matterhow small the smallest infinitesimalthere's a quantization space is dividedup into chunks or space is divided intoa grid and that's really reminiscent ofthings that were happening again back inthe 70s but have been you know obviouslydevelopments in the decades since thenwhere the something called Conway's Gameof Life which is a really really neatexample of how simple rules very simplerules can give rise to complexity andwhat you do is you set up a grid itcould be in three dimensions butgenerally in Conway's Game of Life weconsider two dimensions and what you dois something really really simple reallysimple rules right what we're going todo is we're going to populate this gridso we have squares which are like littleanimals and one and those really simplerules what you basically see so youstart off your system and what you'regoing to do is each time round we get acomputerbut there's no reason if you weresuitably inclined and had nothing betterto do with your life that you couldn'tdo with just pen and paper you look atthis one you look at each animal or eachcell let's call them cells in the gridand you say look at the many neighborsit's got and then you have very simplerules if it's got zero or one neighborsit dies out of loneliness if it's gotmore than four neighbors it dies out ofoverpopulation overcrowding and if it'sgot two or three then it's happy sothat's those those one set of rules ifit's occupied if it's not occupied if itdoesn't have a cell in it then whathappens is that if it's got threeneighbors so here for example then whatwill happen is this one will become liveif you do this I'll show you the screenthis ISM obviously it's going to take along time if we were to do that with penand paperGiancarlo's game of life by a guy calledwhere is it Martin Edwin Martin so whatyou do is let's take a really simple onelike that and what we're going to do iswe're going to play those rules andwatch what happens you might think ohthis is going to be fairly boring bookso you get something which is called aglider just due to the way those thoserules work okay so in this case once itreaches the edge of the grip the edge ofthe grid things effectively stop solet's do this one and let's see whathappens now Wow remember how basic yoursrules are my daughter\u00eds of seven andnine my sons actually fought I couldexplain those rules to him and see whatyou got there this case it reaches asteady stay at a boring steady state butbefore let's run that again it's allthat complexity just from very basicrules stop it again and then or we cando something completely random let'sclear it Edwin's provided the facilityto do need things like this that's avery wonky face and then we run thissame rules and what you see is thepopulation so this is I hope you can seehow its way it's called game of life nowand in the 70s you know this wasparadise for geeks you know this wassteer to the art computer graphics inthe 70s in fact I my computing startedin the eighties with something calledthe zx81 this isn't colorthis is far beyond what I was capable ofback in 1981 so on this would have beenheaven for me but notice so in this casethis once keeps flicking around and itwill do that for infinity but what'sremarkable here is unbelievably simplerules on a grid on this type of gridgive rise to this type of complexity andwhat's the important thing here wellit's the information it's the the factthat this this animal or this whateveryou want to call it sell at thisposition is affected by its influence byits neighbors and it's the it's thoseinteractions and how that information isexchanged that gives rise to this levelof complexity and physicists in allseriousness not all of not allphysicists are allowed to certainlyadmit that there's a large number whowould seriously doubt this and wouldargue that actually at the mostfundamental level space-time realityamongst us around us is not a grid likethis it is not quantized but computerscientists physicists a large number ofthose are arguing well actually no itmay well be like this and then itbecomes very very interesting indeed asto how these basically these rules playout so what this has got to do with youand me and atoms and galaxies is thatthe important thing here is if thesystem depends just solely on wellweather is this unit is this gridoccupied or not is that a 1 or a 0 isthat a bit or is it not a bit then do wetreat particle interactions like thatdigital physics is reasonably welldeveloped there are it has itsproponents it has its opponents but theidea that spaced I might be quantizedwhat are the zeros and ones what's theequivalent like are you talking aboutlike atoms of the bits or is it morefundament it's not as the fundamentalparticles it's the idea that right atthe very limit of a very smallest thingyou can imagine like the Planck lengthat that level we're talking we're seeingthat that space is quantized you knowthese are ones and zeroes if it'soccupied it's a 1 if it's not occupiedit's a zero and what's the equivalent ofoccupied and unoccupied at the quantumin the presence for example the presenceof a particle the absence of a particlewhat slightly more left to field andslightly more off-the-wall butnonetheless interesting is could we beactually the result of a computersimulation by some super hyperdimensional or whatever set of aliens orindeed future generations could we beliving in future and there's a guycalled Nick Bostrom at Oxford at thefuture of humanity Institute in Oxfordwho's proposed something called asimulation argument who argues thisyou've got three options first of allone is that we'd go extinct we don'treach we saw at some point we blowourselves of global warming comes alongand we wipe ourselves out relativelyboring steady-state second one is thatwhat okay we get lots and lots oftechnology but we just sort of loseinterest in for example trying to runsimulations at larger and larger andlarger simulations but the third one andthe third one is the most interestingone is well we develop better and bettertechnology and what that technologyallows us to do is you run better andbetter simulations up to the point wherewe can simulate an entire universe ifyou can simulate an entire universe andif really what matters right at thebottom end of this is whether you fill agrid with ones and zeros that'scomputing then and if our consciousnessand our sentience stems from that thenwhat you'll do is you create sentientbeings in a supercomputer or so and theargument is that if you do have thattype of technological capability ofBostrom's argument is that it'sexceedingly likely if we do progress tothat point that we are in a simulationthis is not reality this is a simulatedreal life and you can think of layersupon layers upon layers of

   "title": "Why Asimov's Laws of Robotics Don't Work - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "06 Nov 2015",
   "transcription": "So, shall we do a video about the three laws of robotics then?(yeah)Because it keeps coming up in the comments...Okay so the thing is, You won'tYou won't hear serious AI researchers talking about the three laws of robotics,because they don't work! They never worked.So I think people don't see the three laws talked about, because they're not serious.They haven't been relevant for a very long time and they're out of a science-fiction book and, you know..So, I'm gonna do it,  I wanna be clear that I'm not taking these as-- I'm not taking these seriously! Right?I'm gonna talk about it anyway because it needs to be talked about.So these are some rules that science fiction author Isaac Asimov came up with in his storiesas an attempted sort of solution to the problem ofmaking sure that artificial intelligence did what we wanted it to do.'Shall we read them out and see what they are?I'll look them up, give me a second.Law number 1: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction allowa human being to come to harmLaw number 2: A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings except where such orderswould conflict with the first law.Law number 3: A robot must protect its own existenceas long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second laws.I think it was his zeroth one later as well.Law 0: A robot may not harm humanity.Or by inaction allow humanity to come to harm.So it's weird that these keep coming up. Because, they....Firstly they are made by someone who is writing stories and they are optimized for story-writing.They don't even work in the books.If you read the books, they are all aboutthe ways that these rules go wrong.Various negative consequences.The most unrealistic thing, in my opinion, about how Asimov did his stuffwas the way that things go wrong and then get fixed.right?Most of the time, if you have a super-intelligencethat is doing something that you don't want it to dothere's probably no hero who's going to save the day with cleverness.Real life doesn't work that way.Generally speaking, right?Because they're written in English, how do you define these things?How do you define humanwithout having to first take an ethical stand on almost every issue?And if \"human\" wasn't hard enough, you then have to define \"harm\".Right? And you've got the same problem again.Almost any definitions you give for those words, really solid unambiguous definitions that don't rely on human intuition,result in weird quirks of philosophy resulting in your A.I. doing something you really don't want it to do.In order to encode that rule: \"Don't allow human being to come to harm\"in a way that means anything close to what we intuitively understand it to meanYou have to encode within the words \"human\" and \"harm\" the entire field of ethics.Right? You have to solve ethics.comprehensivelyand then use that to make your definitions.So that it doesn't solve the problem. It pushes the problem back one step.Into: now, how do we define these terms?When I say the word human, you know what I mean.And that's not because either of us has a rigorous definition of what human is.We've just sort of learned by general associationwhat a human isthe word human points to that structure in your brain but I'm not really transfering the content to you.You can't just say \"human\" in the utility function of an A.I. and have it expect to know what it means, you have to come up with a definition.And it turns out that coming up with a definition, a good definitionof something like human isextremely difficult. Right? It's a really hard problem ofessentially of moral philosophy.You'd think it'd be semantics but it really isn't becauseok, we can agree that I'm a human, and you're a humanThat's fine, and that this, for example, is a table.and therefore not a human.You know, the easy stuff, the central examplesof the classes are obvious.But the edge cases, the boundaries of the classes become really important.The areas in which we're not sure what really counts as a human.So, for example, people who haven't been born yet.In the abstract, like people who hypothetically could be born 10 years in the future, do they count?People who are in a persistent vegetative state?Don't have any brain activity?Do they fully count as people?People who have died?Or unborn foetuses, right?I mean, there's a huge debate even going on right as we speak about whether they count as people.The higher animals, should we include maybe dolphins, chimpanzees, something like that?Do they have weight?So it turns out, you can't program in, you can't make your specification of humansWithout taking an ethical stance on all of these issues.All kinds of weird hypothetical edge cases become relevantWhen you're talking about a very powerful machine intelligence.Which you otherwise wouldn't think of.So, for example, let's say we say thatdead people don't count as humansThen you have an A.I. that will never attempt CPR.This person's died, they're gone, forget about it. Done. Right?Whereas we would say, \"no hang on a second they were only dead temporarily, we can bring them back.\"Right? Okay fine, then we'll say that \"People who are dead, if they haven't been dead for, how long?\" How long do you have to be dead for?If you get that wrong and you just say oh it's fine. Do try to bring people back once they're dead. Then you may end up with a machine that's desperately trying to revive everyone who's ever died in all of history.Because there are people who count, who have moral weight.Do we want that?I don't know, maybe. But you've got to decide.Right? And that's inherit in your definition of human.You have to take a stance on all kinds of moral issues that we don'tactually know with confidence what the answer is.Just to program the thing inand then it gets even harder than that becausethere are edge cases which don't exist right now.Like talking about living people, dead people, unborn people.That kind of thing, fine. Animals.But there are all kinds of hypothetical things which could existwhich may or may not count as human.For example, emulated or simulated brains.Right? If you have a very accurate scan on someone's brain and you run that simulation, is that a person?Does that count?And whichever way you slice that you get interesting outcomes.So if that counts as a personthen your machine might be motivated to bring out a situation in which there are no physical humansbecause physical humans are very difficult to provide forwhereas simulated humans you can simulate their inputs and have a much nicer environment for everyone.Is that what we want?I don't know?Is it maybe? I don't know.I don't think anybody does, but the point, you're trying to write an A.I. here, you're an A.I. developer.

   "title": "CPU vs GPU (What's the Difference?) - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "22 Dec 2015",
   "transcription": "And a graphics processor is a specialist processorthat is designed to make processing of three-dimensional imagesmore efficient than other forms of processor.It is a digital world. It's all 1s and 0s, adds and minuses.And if you do lots of adds, you can turn it into a multiply.But actually, a graphics processor takes a very specialist workloadand does it much more efficiently.What are the fundamental differences between a central processing unitand a graphics processing unit?Well, fundamentally, we're here to put pixels on screens.So, at the end of the day, we are here to execute some commands whose purpose isto say that pixel on that screen is that color.And usually that's presented to us as: Here's some data.So, usually there's a three-dimensional model.So, in front of us is a table. There's a circle which is a few feet off the groundand it's X thickness and it's got some legs and it's at this position.There's some chairs in the room. There's me, there's the walls all around.There's a three-dimensional model. So, first of all, you get given a bunch of coordinatesand say the following things are at the following places.And then you say give them some more data, which is the chair's a lilacand the table's a sort of sludgy grey, and so it's fine.And so you get given some color information, which is what we call textures.The geometry of the scene is usually broken up into trianglesbecause triangles is nice and simple. We're very simple people. We can't cope with complicated stuff.A triangle, three points, always has to be flat. You've never seen a triangle that isn't flat.And so you divide complex surfaces up into triangles and then you have some informationabout what colors those triangles are.So you say, right, okay, I've got the geometry. I've got the color.What do we do next? Well, you put some lights in the scene.So there's some lights in the ceiling which are shedding some light in certain directions.And then you need a camera. So you say the camera is here.So now you have to do some three-dimensional geometry to saywell, what does it look like in the camera? And the first thing you observe iswell, about half the room, you can't see. Phew, that's good.So, I don't have to calculate everything that's behind you.The only thing that I have to calculate are the bits you can see.And you project it so that it goes into the two-dimensional screenAnd this it what it looks like.And then you move the camera around, usually, to get sort of a real impressionof moving through the scene. So, there's a lot of different types of calculationinvolved in that. First is loads and loads and loads of three-dimensional matrix arithmetic.You know, XYZ coordinates, sometimes four-dimensional arrays withXYZ and transparency information. And lots and lots of RGB, red, green, blue, color.So, a device that's really, really good at matrix arithmetic is a good start.Floating point, because the position of all of these things are usually expressed as floating point.And then finally, you've got this unit in the back which says, oh well, I've got lots and lots of pixelsto deal with, so we need to run through that and get them all into a buffer in memory.So, some of that's really quite different from a CPU. A lot of three-dimensional plane equations have to be solved.So, for example, here's the table, here's the floor. Well, which bits of the floor and which bits of the tablecan I see? So you have to do a lot of matrix solving to work that one out.And that's the difference in the problem that gets given to us, right?The difference in the design is: We say, well actually, I can do loads of this in parallelActually, I can do a lot of these quick calculations in parallel because they don't depend on each other.So, every time you hear the phrase, \"For every vertex in the geometry, do blah.\"\"For every pixel in the screen, do foo.\" You can actually say, well actually, that's a million pixels.I can actually calculate them in batches of 256 or something like that.So, we extract the parallelism out of the algorithm, and we design a processor thatis actually very good at parallel processing. So the difference between a CPU and a GPUpredominately is, yes, there's some really, really fixed function blocks which we do very, very efficientlycompared to a CPU, which does everything itself. But also, we are very, very good at extracting parallelism.So, if I want to multiply three floating point numbers together, I'll do it more slowly than a CPU.But if you ask me to multiply a million three floating point numbers together,then the length of time it takes me to do a million will be a lot shorter than the time it takes a CPU to do a million.So, we don't care so much about how long anything individually takes.What we work on is the bulk throughput, and it's a different end to the problem.And of course, there are blurred areas, and some people are now sayingWell, actually there's some sort of computing I could do that would do better on a GPUthan on a CPU. And so you get this whole thing called GPU computing coming alongwhere people are not actually doing graphics, but they're doing throughput computing.And actually, that's been quite interesting hearing.I think one of the ones that somebody suggested was people doing Bitcoin mining with GPUsbecause it's just lots and lots of maths.Yes. But also, image processing. So, in modern devices, you tend to have quite a poor lens,or a poor sensor, and you're trying to take pictures that are as good as that camera you're holdingin your hand that costs thousands. And actually, that takes an awful lot of image cleanupSo, there's an awful lot of computing that's taking place on those digital images.And it turns out that actually a lot of those go quite well when executed on GPUs,not executed on CPUs.Can it fix my bad focusing as well?That is coming, that is coming.",

   "title": "Lambda Calculus - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "27 Jan 2017",
   "transcription": "Today we're going to talk about one ofmy favorite topics in Computer Science,which is the Lambda Calculus. And inparticular, we're going to talk aboutthree things: we're going to think whatactually is it, why is it useful, andwhere did it actually come from? Sowe're going to start with the lastquestion here - where did it actually comefrom?  This is Alonzo Church, who wasa mathematician at Princeton Universityin the United States, and hewas the person who invented the LambdaCalculus. And what he was interested inis what is the notion of a function froma computational perspective. And hisanswer to this question is what we nowknow as the Lambda Calculus. And there'san interesting piece of history here,which many people don't know.So, it turns out that Alonzo Church wasthe PhD supervisor of someone veryfamous in computer science -- AlanTuring.  And of course Alan Turing,amongst many other things which he did,he invented Turing machines -- whichComputerphile has done a number of videoson -- and Turing machines capture a basicstate-based model of computation.  It'sinteresting that his PhD supervisor,Alonzo Church, he captured a basicfunctional notion of computation withhis Lambda Calculus. And it turns outthat these two, quite different notions,one functional and one state-based, turnout to be equivalent -- and this is what'scalled the Church-Turing hypothesis, or part of the Church-Turing hypothesis.So for Church, a function was a black box,but you're not allowed to look inside.And what it does is it takes some input, somaybe it takes a number like x, and it'sgoing to process it in some way, and it'sgoing to produce an output. So maybe itproduces the output x + 1. So this wouldbe a function that takes a singleinput, a number called x, processes insome way, and then produces a singleoutput, which is the number x + 1.And we could have a slightly moreinteresting example. Maybe wehave a box with two inputs, xand y, and we process them in some way,and maybe we produce their sum as theoutput. So this would be a function whichtakes two inputs, x and y, processesthem in some way, and then produces theirsum, x + y. And there's two importantthings about functions in this sense. Thefirst is that they're black boxes; you'renot allowed to look inside, and you can'tsee the mechanics of what's going oninside that box, all you can do it putsomething in and observe what comes outthe other side. And the second importantthing is that these functions are pure,they have no internal state; so all thathappens when you map x across to x + 1,is the magic goes on inside the box, andthere's no internal state, there's nohidden information that we can use. Andthis is quite different from the notion ofcomputation that Alan Turing was interestedin with his Turing machines -- he hadinternal state -- there's no internal state,these are pure mathematical functions. Nowwe can think how do you actually definefunctions in the Lambda Calculus. Andthere is a very, very simple syntax forthis, which I'll introduce to you now. Solet's think about the increment functionin the Lambda Calculus. What you do isyou write down a lambda symbol -- so thisis the Greek lower-case letter lambda, andthat says we're introducing a functionat this point. And then you just writedown the name of the input, so that was x.And then you have a dot, and thenyou say how the output is calculated interms of the input, that's x + 1. So wecould do the same with addition, you justneed two lambdas, and write lambda x,dot, lambda y, dot, x + y. So this is thefunction that takes two inputs, xand y, and then delivers the result x + y.And this is written down formally inChurch's Lambda Calculus exactly likethis. So, when you've got a function,what can you do with it? Well, all you cando is give it some input, let it do itsthing, and it will give you some output.So let's have a simple example of this.If we take a function like increment,which was lambda x, x + 1, and weapply it to a number like 5, what actuallyhappens? It's a basic process ofsubstitution; we're essentially substitutingthe number 5 here into the body ofthis lambda expression and then xbecomes 5, so we get 5 + 1,and then we get the result 6 on theother side. And this is basically allthere is to the Lambda Calculus. It'sonly got three things: it's got variables,like x, y and z; and it's got a way ofbuilding functions -- this lambda notation;and it's got a way of applying functions.This is the only three things that youhave in the setting.  What isactually the point of the Lambda Calculus? We've introduced this verysimple notation, why should you beinterested in learning about it? I thinkthere's three answers which I would giveto this. The first point I'd make is thatthe Lambda Calculus can encode anycomputation. If you write a program inany programming language, which has everbeen invented, or ever will be invented,or really any sequential programminglanguage, it can in some way be encodedin the Lambda Calculus. And of course itmay be extremely inefficient when you dothat, but that's not the point -- this is abasic idea of computation, and we want tothink how many and what kind of programscan we encode this, and actually you canencode anything. And this is really thekind of Church-Turing hypothesis whichI mentioned. Alan Turing, you can encodeanything in his Turing machines, and inChurch's Lambda Calculus, you can encodeanything.  And actually these two systemsare formally equivalent -- any Turingmachine program can be translated into anequivalent Lambda Calculus program, andvice versa.  They areformally equivalent. Thesecond point I would make is that LambdaCalculus can also be regarded as thebasis for functional programminglanguages like Haskell. So these arebecoming increasingly popular these days.And actually a very sophisticatedlanguage like Haskell is compiled down toa very small core language, which isessentially a glorified form of LambdaCalculus. So if you're interested infunctional programming languageslike Haskell, or the ML family,these are all fundamentally based on theLambda Calculus -- it's just kind of a glorified syntax on top of that. Thethird point which I would make, is thatthe Lambda Calculus is actually nowpresent in most major programminglanguages. So this wasn't the case 10 or 15years ago, but it is the case today. So ifyou look at languages like Java, likeC#, even Visual Basic, F#, and soon, all of these languages now encodeLambda Calculus, or include LambdaCalculus, as a fundamental component. Soevery computer scientist today needs toknow about Lambda Calculus. WhatI'd like to end up with isa couple of little examples of what youcan do with it. So, the Lambda Calculus hasbasically got nothing in it: it's got variables,it's got a way of building functions, and it'sgot a way of applying functions. Itdoesn't have any built-in data typeslike numbers, logical values, recursionand things like that. So if you want todo these things in the Lambda Calculus,you need to encode them. So I'll endup showing you a simple encoding, and theencoding which I'm going to show you isthe logical values TRUE and FALSE. Andthe key to this is to think what do youdo with logical values in a programminglanguage? And the basic observation isthat you use them to make a choicebetween doing two things -- you say ifsomething is TRUE do one thing, ifsomething is FALSE do another thing, andwe're going to use this idea of making achoice between two things to actuallyencode TRUE and FALSE. So the trick isfor TRUE, you write down this lambdaexpression. So what it does is it takestwo things, x and y, and then it choosesthe first. And FALSE does the opposite.It's going to take two things, and it'sgoing to choose the second. So we've gottwo lambda expressions here, both ofwhich take two inputs, x and y, and onechooses the first one, x, and one chooses thesecond one, y.  So fair enough,what can we actuallydo with this? Well, let's think how wecould define a little logical operator.So, NOT is the most simple logicaloperator which I could think of. It's goingto flip TRUE to FALSE, and FALSE to TRUE.It's logical negation. Based upon thisencoding, how could I actually define theNOT operator or the NOT function. It'svery easy to do. I will take in a logicalvalue, or a Boolean as it normally calledin Computer Science, after George Boole, whofirst studied a kind of formal logic. Sowe take a Boolean, which will be one of TRUEor FALSE, and here's what we do. We applyit to FALSE, and we apply it TRUE. And Iclaim that this is a valid definitionfor a NOT function. But I can veryeasily convince you that it's the case,because I can do a little calculation.So, let's check, if we apply NOT to TRUE,that we actually get FALSE. And in just afew steps, using the Lambda Calculus magic,we'll find that this actually worksout. So what can we do here?Well the only thing wecan do is start to expanddefinitions. So, we know what the definitionof NOT is. It was lambda b, b applied toFALSE and TRUE, and then we just copydown the TRUE. So all I've done in thefirst step here, is I've expanded mydefinition of NOT -- NOT was defined to bethis Lambda Calculus expression here. Now,I've got a function, which is this thing,and it's applied to an input,so i can just apply it.OK, and the function says if I take in a b,I just apply that b to FALSE and TRUE.So, the thing I'm applying it to is TRUEhere, so i just do the littlesubstitution. Rather than b, I write TRUE,and then I copy down the FALSE, and copydown the TRUE, and I get down to here.And at this point, you might quiterightly be thinking thislooks like complete rubbish.I've just written TRUE FALSE TRUE.What does that mean? It means absolutelynothing. But it means something in theLambda Calculus, because we continue toexpand. So, what we can do now, is expandthe definition of TRUE. We said that TRUEtakes two things, and chooses the first one.So, let's expand it out. So, TRUE islambda x, lambda y, x. So, it chooses thefirst thing of two things, and then we justcopy down the two inputs, FALSE AND TRUE.And you can see what's going tohappen now -- we've got a function herewhich takes two things and chooses the firstthing. Here the first thing is FALSE, sowhen we apply the function, we just getback FALSE.  So what you seehas happened here, in justa few steps, we've shown how using thisencoding of TRUE and FALSE, and not, wecan actually get the desired behavior.And it's very easy to check for yourself,if you apply NOT to FALSE, you'll get TRUE.And I'd like to set you a little kind ofpuzzle at this point -- think howyou could define logical AND,or logical OR, in this style as well.And I'm interested to see what kindof definitions people come up with inthe comments. So, the very last thing I'dlike to show you is this lambdaexpression here, which is a very famousLambda Calculus expression called the Ycombinator, or the Y operator. And actually,this is the key to doing recursion inthe Lambda Calculus. So, as I mentioned,Lambda Calculus has basically nothing init, or it's only got three things in it:variables x, y and z, and so on; a way ofbuilding functions; and a way of applyingfunctions. It's got no other controlstructures, no other data types, no anything.So, if you want to do recursion,which is the basic mechanism fordefining things in terms of themselves --again Computerphile's had videos on this --you need to encode it. And it turns outthat this expression here is the key toencoding recursion in the LambdaCalculus. And this expression wasinvented by someone called Haskell Curry,and this is the Haskell that giveshis name to the Haskell programminglanguage. And he was a PhD student ofDavid Hilbert, who's a very famousmathematician. The last observationI'd like to leave you with here, issomething that's interested me for manyyears. I think there's a connection betweenthis piece of kind of abstract computerscience, or abstract mathematics, andbiology. If you look at human DNA, youhave this double helix structure; youhave two copies of the same thing,side-by-side, and this is the key toallowing DNA to self-replicate. If youlook at the structure of this lambdaexpression here, we have two copies ofthe same thing side-by-side.  You havelambda x, f applied to x x, and exactly thesame here. This is the key to doingrecursion, which is kind of related toself-replication in a programminglanguage, or in the Lambda Calculus. Andfor me, I don't think this is acoincidence -- I think it's kind ofinteresting philosophical observation.The Lambda Calculus has this kind ofvery clever way of doing recursion, whichwould take a video on its own to explainhow it actually works, but you can look itup on Wikipedia. And there's a link here,I think, to biology.  Somebodyactually found the Y Combinatorso interesting, that they've had ittattooed permanently on their arm, andyou can find a picture of this if you do aquick web search. What would people search for?The Y combination -- the Y combinator inmathematics or computer science.And tattoo I'm guessing.  Yup!",

   "title": "Turing Machines Explained - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "29 Aug 2014",
   "transcription": "Back at the start of the 20th centurymathematicians were fascinated by the question'just how much maths can we do, not byusing ourgut feelings or intuitions but just byfollowing rules very very carefullyby following an algorithm'? In order tomake that notion precisewe would have to set out: \"just what do wemean by a programor algorithm\" - and this is where Alan Turing came in,with his notion of a Turing machine.Turing was working on a problem inFormal Logicand as part of his proof he had to come upwith the notionof any possible algorithmor any possible machine. He had to comeup with a very general way of capturinghow algorithms or programs or machineswould workThis is where his notion of a Turingmachine comes in. The way Turingdescribed these machines goes like this:you have a way ofwriting down information in a coded form.His way was to think of a tape which isas long as it needs to be.It's divided up into squares and each of the squares there is either oneor a zero or we can have some spaces. Nowwhat our machine doesis it looks at the tapeone square at a time. So you couldimagine itas a little box running above the tape,maybe on little wheels, lookingone square at a time and thatinformationcodes up a question or a problem that wewant solved.What a Turing machine does is reallysimpleat any moment in time it's in aparticular stateand it's looking at one square on thetape, and it hasa logbook, a program book. And that tells it,if for instance you're in state number23and you're looking at a zero, then rub out the zero, change itto one, move one square to the right,and move into state number 359,for instance. Or if you're in statenumber 359 and you're looking at a oneleave that one as it is, move one square tothe leftand move into state number twenty. Reallysimple instructions!what the machine does, is it starts offwith a certainpattern of ones and zeros. Itfollows these rules one square at a time,transforming that string of ones and zerosinto a different string of ones and zeros.And eventually - hopefully -the machine moves into a halting state,it is finished, it is done.And what's left on the tape is the answer toour problem,coded up as ones and zeros. That is sucha simpleprocess but it turns out it's theessence of computation. Whateverany computer can do, it could in theorybe done by that system looking at onesand zeroson a tape. So that's why we saythat Turing in coming up with hisidea of Turing machines,in effect, came up with a blueprint formodern digital computers.Those computers manipulate strings ofones and zerosto solve problems. This really simpleidea that we find in Turing machines isactually sopowerful that all modern computersbasically do what Turing machines do. Andwe use this ideato evaluate the strength of moderncomputer programs.When a computer program can dowhat a Turing machine can do, we call it Turing completeand that is the top of the hierarchy ofprogram strength. So the strongestprogram that we can get does exactlywhata Turing machine can do. We've never come up witha way of computing thingsthat could do more than a Turing machine. Sorecently, there's been a challenge to theideathat anything a computer can do, a Turing machine can do.And the challenge comes from quantumcomputers whichalmost seem like they can do thingsmagically.My take on this is that a quantumcomputercan't do more than a Turing machine butit can do things moreefficiently. For instance, if you askeda classical computer to find you a phonenumberin the phone directory, you have to lookfor every singleentry and it takes a long time.But a quantum computer can do thatmore efficiently, don't ask me how.oklook whathappens, if I've read a zero, which I have, there.What do I then do? The answer is Ioverride it with a one. Call that machineH,for the halting problem, if you give methat machine, I could transform it into adifferent machine,like this.",

   "title": "How Computer Memory Works - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "23 Jun 2014",
   "transcription": "So we saw how the Mac used 30 pin SIMS like this to store its memoryAnd we'll look later at what sort of information the computer stores in these thingsBut for now, I just want to look at how this actually stores information.Now as I'm sure all of you are aware, it stores it in terms of binary digits or bitsBut actually what we are really interested in [is] just storing a single bitand we can put them together to form lots of memory.So to understand how the memory works, we need to look at some of the basic digital logic circuits we can build using logic gates.Now over on Numberphile, Matt Parker introduced these using dominoes to create various thingsWe're going to look at them in terms of the electronic chipsSo you can buy your basic logic circuits in integrated circuits like this.This one's four OR gates.So [incomprehensible], you put them together in an electronic circuit to build memoryNow this is a bit odd because normally these are just used to process or combine various inputsbut if we connect them in a specific way, we can actually get them to store informationat least until the power is turned off.So what we've got here are two very basic electronic circuits.We've got an AND gate here, and an OR gate in this chip, here.These chips come with four AND gates or four OR gates togetherAnd if we remember from the Numberphile video,  an AND gate is on when both of its inputs are on.If either input if off, then the output is off.So in this case, I wired it up to a simple L.E.D., so that we can see the output of one of the AND gates.And I've wired both of the inputs to the positive voltage rail because we use positive five volts to represent TRUE or one in binaryand we use ground, or zero volts, to represent false or zero in binary.Now. That's generally what we use with what was called TTL logic.These days you use different voltage levels and so on, but the principle is the same;you have one voltage which represents FALSE, or zero, and another voltage which is generally higher that represents one, or TRUE.So if I take... Hang on. If I just move these over so you can see what I'm doing.So both of these are currently connected to logic 1, or five volts.If I disconnect one and connect it to logic zero, you can see that immediately that light goes off, because the AND gate has now got one input zero, one input at one,one and zero is zero by the laws of boolean algebra.So we can combine these in different ways,And [incomprehensible] back in one, both one, it's on.Put them both to zero, then they're both off.Over here, I've got an OR gate.And if you remember back from the Numberphile video, an OR gate is on when either of its inputs are on, or both of them are on.So I'm gonna to rewire the circuit to do that.So often you'll get books like this which will give you details of different things.The quad input positive OR gates has inputs on pins one and two and the output on pin three.The AND gate, the 7402, has the inputs on pins two and three, and the [output] on pin one.So, connect the output to pin three.And we can now start to connect the inputs.Now in both cases... Woops! I just shorted the uh...Oo. Ha Ha.*laughing\" I just shorted the uh...[BRADY]: A little bit hot?[GUY]: Yeah. Just shorted the power supply which is why it's making noise.So we connect both of these to... The cable's all melted! ...pin zero.And if we now unplug that and plug it into there,Have I just broken everything?[BRADY]: You fried the chip![GUY]: I hope this gets edited outYeah. So that's right. Um. I've either fried everything on here...[BRADY]: Are you now turning it off and on again?[GUY]: I am indeed turning it off and on again, here, in the hope that I haven't just shorted everything out.Uum.[BRADY]: Shall we pause there?[GUY]: Yeah. I think we might need to pause it. Ha ha ha ha.Smoke's cleared, and we've just had a slight problem with power supplybut we're back and running now. There's a little hamster running around in a wheel to power everything at the moment.So we've rewired this so that the output of the OR gate is now connected to the L.E.D. and these are both tied to logic zero through these resistors here.If I now connect any of these to logic one,the input comes on. So that's input two connected to logic one.Input one, the input comes on.And of course because it's an OR gate, if I connect the second input at the same time, then they're both on.We also get other versions of these chips.and these are called NAND gates or NOR gates.And they work in exactly the same way. They two inputs and they AND them togetherbut immediately following that, build into the chip, is what's called a NOT gate, which inverts the output.So it's the opposite of an AND gate. Its output is off when both of its inputs are on.So I'm-gonna-open this up.There we are.So-I'm-gonna take the AND chip out. There we are!And pop this chip in.It can be a pain because you have to bend all of the legs to fit in.There we go.So that's now in placeSo-I-gotta rewire it now to use a NAND gate that I've popped in there.So I connect the output to pin three of this circuit.and the L.E.D. of course comes on, because both inputs one and two are wired to zero.Normally an AND gate would be off because both of its inputs are zeroBut this is the opposite of that so both of its inputs are zero, it's now on.So if we connect input two to five volts,it stays on because zero and one is zero. There inverse of that is one.But if we connect input one as well to five volts, then the L.E.D. goes off.Because one and one is one, the opposite of that is zero, so the L.E.D. is now off.But as soon as we disconnect one of the pins, it comes back on.And one of the fascinating things about NAND gates is that you could build a whole computer just using the circuits on this chip.You'd need lots of them. You'd need more than four.But what we are going to do today is use, not a NAND gate to start with, but a NOR gate,which is an OR, then NOTed.to actually build some memory.So over here, here is one I prepared earlier, we have quad input NOR gate.So-this-is four NOR gatesSo-what-I'm-gonna do is wire two NOR gates into a circuit so that it'll actually store the information that we put in it.I'm gonna use this one on the left here.And this one over here. Let me just check the wiring diagramWe have pins one is the output of the NOR gate. Two and three are the inputs.And on the other side, pin thirteen is the output in pin eleven and twelve.So I'm gonna connect the output of this NOR gate on the right hand sideto the input of the one on the left hand side[BRADY]: Shall we call them A and B or..?[GUY]: Yeah. So we connected the output of NOR gate B to the input of NOR gate AAnd-now-I'm-gonna connect the output of NOR gate A back to the input of NOR gate B.It's a very tight fit so... There we go.So we've got these two things crossed over, but the output of one is connected to the input of the other.And just to make sure the circuit works, I'm just gonna put some resistors to tie the other input to zero volts to our logic zero.This means that I can make them logic one or logic zero just by touching the leg of the resistor with a wire connected to five voltslater in the demonstrationSo the other thing I'm gonna do is I've connected the output of NOR gate A to this wire here.And I'm just gonna put a L.E.D. across that wire to ground like so.And I'm gonna to the same on the other side. So I'll connect that up like so. There.And well see that this L.E.D. has now come on.So I now get a fly wire, plug this into five volts like that.And if I touch this one, this L.E.D. comes on, and it stays on.If I touch that one, that L.E.D. goes off and this one comes on, and stays on.This circuit is remembering its state. And we can do that by just driving a signal into the chip.And it'll stay like that until I turn the power off.We need to look at how this circuit works.What-I'm-gonna do is draw it out. But before we do that, it would be useful to refresh out memory of how a NOR gate works.Ah. So that's a NOR gate and it has two inputs which we'll label as a and b and it has an output which we'll label as q.So we can build a truth table for this.So normally with an OR gate, zero OR zero would be zero.But we're inverting it because it's a NOR gate. So the output is one.Zero or one is one, but it's inverted so the output is zero.One or zero is one, but it's inverted so the output's zero.One or one is one, inverted, so the answer is zero.So that's the truth table for our NOR gate.Now let's have a look at the circuit that we used over there.So we had our first NOR gate and we also had our second NOR gate, like that.And we've got the inputs to these like so.And we took the output from here and connected it to the input of that one.And we took the output from here and connected it here.We've now got two inputs left that we're not using and I gotta label them as Rbecause that is what we use to reset it.and we've got S which is what we used to set it, or to store a bit.We've also got two outputs. And I'm gonna label the first one q and the other one we're gonna call this NOT q.And the way we do that is is we draw a line over the top to say that this is NOT q.Now the thing we have to remember about these circuits is that they don't switch the output instantaneously when the inputs switches.There is a slight very short delay. And depending in what kind of chip you get... But there is always a slight delay.So-what-I'm-gonna do is I'm gonna draw out our truth table for thisSo we've got input R, and we've got input S, we've got output q, and output q NOT q.But these are also inputs to this.So I'm actually going to put in q prime and NOT q prime.To start with, this is at zero, this is at zero.We don't know what these values are, so we'll leave them blank.What's the next value of q going to be?So it's going to be zero, OR'd with the current value of NOT q, NOT'd, so that's gonna be represented as  q NOT q, NOT'd.NOT q, NOT'd is of course q because the two NOTs cancel out.So the value of q prime is whatever the old value of q was effectively.Same happens for NOT q prime. That's s, which is zero.OR'd with the old value of q, NOT'd so we get NOT q.So as long as the two inputs are zero, you get the same values propagating through the circuit.But what happens if we set s to be one. We'll leave r at zero.So our new value of q is gonna be the old value of NOT q OR'd with zeroSo it's gonna be NOT NOT q again. So it's gonna be q.Our new value of NOT q is gonna be s, which is one,  OR'd with whatever the value of q was, NOT'd.Now if you OR anything with one, if you think about the truth table, the answer is always one.So NOT q is going to be zero because it's NOT of one.So we're gonna get a zero in there.So we can feed those back in againWe've still got zero and one as the input hereWe now know that the output of q bar, or NOT q, is zero.So what's the new value of q gonna be?Well, it's the output of NOT q, which is zero OR'd with zeroNOT'd which is oneThe output of q prime is going to be oneand the output of q bar prime... Well that's still one OR'd with whatever the output of q was before.So we'll call that q, that's always going to be one, NOT'd, so that's gonna be zero.And if we run those values through again... So we've got zero, one, one zero.Then we get the same values out: one, zero.But the interesting thing is, when this becomes zero, and that becomes zero again,q is still at one, NOT q is still at zeroIf we run the circuit through here, the new value of q is the old value of NOT q OR'd with zerothat's zero, NOT'd, that's one.And NOT q prime is S, which is zero, with the old value of q, which was one, and that's one, NOT'd, that's zero.So it stays the same, and you get the same input coming through.So it actually continues.And we could do the same thing with the reset, and you'd find if you work it through, that it resets it and all of the values go to zero.So that very simple circuit will actually store the state if it is set and if it is reset.And you can actually build up a complete memory circuitbecause you can put some very simple digital logic in front of that to generate the right s or r signalbased on the value of a bit and whether you want to store it or not.[LEFTVIDEO]: ...and everybody was gonna  click on that one. Well it turned out that the video behind that was a person talking about the fight[RIGHTVIDEO]: Only that will fall over, that wont move. Here we go! Ready?",

   "transcription": "Today we are going to be talking about a problem in logicand how in solving that problem,Alan Turing almost inadvertentlyinvented the modern digital computer.So we start back at the beginning of the20th century, where mathematicians hadposed this problem - in logic we'reinterested in finding \"Do these premisesentail this conclusion?\" So premises arethe bits you start off with in an argumentthey are your -- the bits you know at thebeginning or your assumptions and theconclusion is the bit you want toestablish the bit that you reason towith your argument and we want to knowis there a test that will tell usyes for sure these premises do or don'tentail this conclusion. Is there anautomatic way of finding out whetherthey do or whether they don't?So that's the problem, it's called thedecision problem.The mathematicians wanted to find out \"Isthere an answer to the decision problemfor first order logic?\"that's the kind of logic you learn inphilosophy or mathematics at universityso lots of mathematicians were trying towork out is first order logic decidablethat is can we automatically testwhether the premises entail theconclusionAlan Turing was one of the first todiscover that first order logic isn'tdecidable.

   "title": "CNN: Convolutional Neural Networks Explained - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "20 May 2016",
   "transcription": "This is kind-of a follow up to Brais' videos on deep learningSo deep learning is kind of a big thing at the momentand there's some disagreement between research over whether this is gonna be - the, this is *it*This is the big thing that's gonna change everythingor whether this is another flash in the pan, like artificial neural networks were in the 80sEveryone got very excited and they got quite a good resultsand when they realized that they couldn't solve all the problems with them, I don't knowFor what it's worth, these are a big deal, I think[offscreen] Let's talk about convoluted neural networks, have I said that right?Convolutional neural networks.[offscreen] Ah, right, okThey combine both deep neural networks, which is what Brais was talking aboutand kernel convolutions, which is what I talked about in a previous video.I would thoroughly recommend people watch that videoYou know, it's got an entertaining host, right?*laugh from offscreen*So, but, but, because, if you don't know what a kernel convolution is, this isn't gonna make much sense to youSo watch that video first[offscreen] So that's the kernel convolutions we did on graphics and things like, uh, sobel op-Yeah, Sobel operations, Gaussian blurs, and things like this.Sobel operations in particular, and edge detectionSo, if we think back to a traditional artificial neural networkok, what we've got is we've got some kind of input we're trying to learn, okwe've got some hidden layers, alright, and then we've got some output layersmaybe just this one, I don't knowAnd these are fully connected, so we have lots of connections from hereand here and here and these are connected to hereand so on, I'm just drawing in a few of them,and then these are all connected to the end.ok, Now using Brais's analogy, we were talking about house prices.ok, so, this will be something like number of bedrooms,and this would be something like \"has it got a pool\"and this would be, you know, what floor space is itand has it got a good garden and so onlots of these, ok, lots of inner nodes that we don't really care about particularly, or I don'tUh, right, and so on and so forth, and then finally at the end we have a house price.Now what this house price is, is a complicated function of these inputs.It's complicated becausethis node here is some linear, or non-linear now, combination ofthese. ok, so, a bit of thisplus a bit of this, plus a bit of this, plus a bit of thisthrough some non-linearity function.This is a different combination of these.This, again, different combination of these, and so on, rightAnd then this, a different combination of theseSo, you can see, you're building up some kind of level of abstraction herewhere you've got combinations of combinationsAnd that function is very complicatedWhen Brais talked about a black box, in some ways that's exactly what it isbecause we can't look at these individual weights and say, \"well that's got .2 of this one, so that must mean this\"because we just don't know what it means, rightIn the grand scheme of things, in this whole network, we don't know what that individual weight meansAnd to be honest, we might not even care that muchWhat we really care about is how well does it predict house price, how accurate is that based on thatfor a different input, so we change this, read the output - is it good?Yes? Brilliant!ok, now, for images, which is obviously what I spend most of my time around,this is a start, but it's not very useful to me.If you think that this is our inputs, ok, and I give you a picture of a house, and I say \"right, tell me how much this house is worth\"ok, well, what?So how do I, ok, so there's two things I could do, rightfirst of all is I could try and calculate things like number of bedrooms and stuff, based on the imageand put them in hereIn some way, I'd be calculating some featuresand then I'd be putting them in here and learning on those features.That is quite a smart way of doing it, because, apart from that's obviously quite difficultum, it's smart because we don't have to have that many more neuronsIn anything, we can actually use the same network as we used before for our modelon our house, all we have to do is work out the bit of code that does the image analysisNow, anyone that's tried to find out the number of rooms in a house based only on one picture of the outside of the house will tell me that that can't be done, rightThat's hard.Ok, so you could naively think, what we could do insteadis just put the image in here.Make this the first pixel,and this the second pixel,and this the third pixel,and so on, ok.Then, this has got all the information it could ever need, rightBut it, but that's the problem7 megapixel image, that's 7 million input nodes, let's say we have 7 million nodes on the next layereach one connects to each other one, you can see that that's just gonna melt my computerit's not even gonna try and create it, it's too much informationThat's why we downsample our space a little bit.What we would usually do is calculate some small subset of featuresand then we would put them in at this end.So that's quite important. So, traditional machine learning is done a bit like that.So Michel's done some videos on this. Calculate some features about someone's faceand put that in to some machine learning algorithmWhat you don't do is try and put the machine learning algorithm just on the facebecause it's too much information thereUntil now, ok, right? That's where convolutional neural networks step in.So, convolutional neural networks replace each of these nodes with a kernel convolution.So, like, a Sobel edge detectorNow, so instead of what I would've done before, which was run a Sobel over something and then machine learn on that,I just give this the opportunity to learn which features are interestingmaybe it is an edge detection, maybe it is a corner detectionmaybe it's something that highlights whatever's in the middle of the pictureOr something that highlights the top left-hand cornerit doesn't really matter, and the point is I don't know what they areright, if I give you, you know, two thousand pictures of housesand ask you to predict house prices based on the picturesI don't know for sure, I can guess, but it might be - that how many windows it has and things like thisbut I don't know for sure.And a computer can brute-force through those things much quicker than I can and tell meAnd then I can go, I can both predict it, and I can look back and say, \"oh, it was windows after all\"So, let's imagine that what we have is our image, ok, soI'm gonna move away from the house analogy now because I'm gonna have to draw a lot of pictures of housesif I do that. Ok, so let's talk about CNN worksUm, and why it's useful. So, we have an image of somethingNow, I have seen convolutional neural networks used for non-imagesbut for now, we'll just talk about imagesThis is a picture of, let's say me. It's, you know, it's not a great likeness but I'll stick by itNow, there are three channels here, ok.So this is actually a 3D volume, in some senseremember when we talked about 3D images,you could view RGB as a, in some sense, 3DSo, the first plane is our R, G, and B, or vice versaWhat we do is, if we performed a Sobel edge detection on this,what it would do is produce another image that was  slightly smaller than thisand only one deep.So hypothetically, it would be another image where the edges, let's say the horizontal edges, were highlightedSo it would kinda look like, that, or something, I don't knowsome half of my face where the horizontal edges are highlighted, okIt's not a great diagramBut there would only be one output, because Sobel just outputs a number between 0 and 255, as soon as you scale it, okNow the problem is that I don't know that Sobel's the best thing for this task, okIt might be, right, it might be useful to detect edges on houses, to work out what their prices areor if you want to detect faces, to detect the size of the face, that kind of makes senseOn the other hand, it's gonna produce a lot of erroneous bitsif I was sitting in front of a tree, there's gonna be loads of edge stuff going on there that I don't care aboutIn a convolutional neural network, what we do is we do, let's say, 60 of these on the first layer.So we have one, and then behind it we have another one, and behind it we have another one, and behind it we another one, and so on, going this way.So the first one will be some convolution process applied to this whole imagethat takes three input channels and outputs one output channelThe next one will be a different kernel convolution operationso each of these will have a different kernelthose are our weights, those are these values hereIn sort of our analogy back to normal learningUm, and so let's say we have 60 of those, or 64 of thoseOne of them might be detecting edges, one of them might be detecting cornersUm, and then we use them as our features for learningNow that's a start, but we're - this is is deep learning now, right, so what do we do nowwell, what we now do is we do more features based on these featuresSo we find combinations of corners, combinations of edges, that make something interestingMy face is not just a circle of edges, what it is is a number of corners and edges and bits of texture and thingsall in a specific shape that is unique to, uh, well, certainly to a human face, but even unique to meright, because we're capable of distinguishing between different peopleSo, this kernel window will go down to this pixel hereok, so this will slide about this image and produce this output imageand then the next one will do the same, and the next one will do the sameThen we do the same thing on this onelet me do it in a different pen so we can see better.Here's my red kernel convolutionand this slides about and produces another image,which is a slight combination of, maybe, corners and edgesor something. I mean, this second level, it's not gonna be too abstract, but we'll get the ideaSo there's gonna be some sort of shape that's gonna be sort of...It's not gonna make much sense to us, but it'll make some sense to this machine.And there'll be another set of these, so there'll be lots of these, right, going backAll of these will look different and be some different representation of my face transformed in some way, to be usefulAnd again, I haven't picked these, these have been learned, just like a normal deep learning algorithmSo I haven't had to say, \"I definitely think edges are important for this\"cause I don't know for sure.So this goes on, and we keep doing this, and sometimes we also downsample the size of these images,just to save memory, ok, but we won't dwell on that too much.And, because of the way that we downsample, and the way that sometimes these convolution operations slightly shrink the image,cause they don't go all the way to the edge, rightIf you've got a 5 by 5 kernel, you can't go to the edge 2 pixels cause you're going off the edgeso we don't worry about that, we just get slightly smallerIn the end, we end up with a much smaller image, and lots of features going all the way backSo these are my different convolutions of convolutions, of convolutions, of convolutionsAnd each one will look different, and represent something differentand we don't know what that is.So this one, could be highlighted when it's a face in the middle, or it could be dark when there isn'tThis one might be highlighted when there's an ear at a certain position, and so on.Eventually, these will get down to being just one pixel, and very very longSo essentially what we've done there is we completely removed the spatial dimension.There's no more spatial information left, we don't know where anything is. But we know what it is, because it's listed in all these features.These now are our neurons at the end.So we have a couple more layers that point to these, and then finally, we have one at the end that says\"Is this a picture of Mike's face?\"And it produces a 1 if it is, and a 0 if it isn't. And then what we do is, just like a normal network, we train it.So we say, \"here's a picture of me\", ok , so this should be a 1. And let's say it's 0.5.cause it's kind of random. So we adjust these weights, and we adjust the weights inside all these kernel convolutions.[offscreen] So does that adjustment happen manually?No, it happens using a, uh, well, it's coded in, um, but it's usually performed by a library, and it's using a process called back propagation.So what we do is we basically predict what direction we have to move the weights in to improve our output,and then we move them over slightly in that direction.And we have to do it in reverse order, because these onesdepend on these ones, depend on these ones, and vice versa, what we do is we say,well, look, given that I've said it's 0.5 chance of Mike and we want a 1,how do I change these weights here to get slightly closer to 1?and I do it. And then I say, \"how do I change these again to do even better?\" and so onand then I work my way back, ok, that kind of maths we're not gonna go into, right.A lot of these things are, are implemented in librariesSo as a researcher, I mean, much as I'd like to implement some of these things, it takes quite a long timejust because programming takes a while, right, andAnd, it's better for me just to apply these things and get good resultsthan it is for me to reinvent the wheel all the time, constantly, if everyone was programming the same things over and over again,no one would get anything doneSo, I'd have to start by programming up Linux, to get, to get, I'm not claiming I can, by the way,and, and so on. So, you know, let's not reinvent the wheel.Um, so I do this, I send in, let's say 1000 pictures, 500 of which are meyou know, so I've been to a photo shoot or something, rightand 500 of which are not.And I train it so the convolutions and these weights on the output are such thatit gets 1 when it's a picture of me and 0 when it isn't.And then I can look at these convolutions and say \"what is it about me that's distinctive?\"And it's probably gonna be finding, um, you know, weird shapes on my face, rightcause it's a bit of a weird shape, so it - things that are unique to meNow in a more general situation, there's a big database called ImageNetThey have a competition every year to see who can classify these images the best.So dogs, cats, planes, trees, and so onOK, they're all in there, and there's a thousand or so images of eachright, so, we have a really big network that's much bigger than this little one I drewand we say, \"right, let's throw millions of images at this\", right, thousands of cats, thousands of dogsand we have lots more outputs than just the one,and we say \"what is it?\" and it says \"it's a dog\" and it is. *dog bark*Convolutional neural networks have been around for a little whilebut, they've really started to be big in about 2012 when it - when someone came along, applied one of these to ImageNet, and got incredible results.And so on and so forth. And now there's this big push and everyone's trying to get even better results, and even better results.Now, I work on more of the applied end of computer science, so I'm more interested in how this affects plant science and things like thisSo that's what we're working on.Um, but, the kind of results we're seeing are really really impressiveSo, I mean, case in point, I've done, I've done some root tip detection, so detection of root tips in images, right, of plantsand, um, I've got some software that I've already programmedand I've kind of done a low-level feature detector approach to detecting root tipsand it's about 70%, ok, which is what you would expect, because maybe some root hair gets confused as to root tipor a bit of blotch of dirt, or maybe there's just two root tips really close together and it gets confusedThis, the CNN that I trained, um, is 98% accurateAnd it finds them with 99% accuracy.It doesn't make many mistakes.And that's over thousands of images.[offscreen] So does that mean the work you've done already just goes out the window?Yep. Uh, no, to an extent, yes, and to an extent, no.You need expertise to be able to craft a network and train it and prepare the images.And there's obviously work to be done, and there's some disagreement over how much of a problem you can solve with a convolutional neural networkSo, there are lots more things you can do with roots beyond finding tips.Can you do all of them with a convolutional neural network?I don't know, we'll see. Are we trying, but, we'll see.Maybe not. So maybe what you do is you use this as a tool, just like other machine learning algorithms, within a package that does lots of other things as well.On the other hand, if you're just doing cat and dog detection, you might as well use a CNN, cause it's gonna do better than anything else.The other purpose for ways the botnet can use its parts is for distributed computing [fades out][fades in] Now, some objects obviously are more amenable to this than others, but the more images we get, the better it is. There's no depth involved here at all, ok",

   "title": "Where GREP Came From - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "06 Jul 2018",
   "transcription": "I thought today maybe we would talk about 'grep', a well-known command in the UNIX world. Something that's been around since the early1970s. What 'grep' lets you do is to search for patterns of text - arbitrary patterns of text inone or more files and there could be an unbounded number offiles of input. Or the input could be coming from some otherprogram, for example as it is if you're using Unix pipelines.So you take some program and you pipe it into 'grep' and that way, no matter what the amount of input is, 'grep' canfilter out, or show you, the things that you're interested in.And that's stuff that you can't do with a text editor very conveniently - if at all.One of the issues with 'grep' has always been:Where does that weird name come from?And so I thought, perhaps, I could tell that story, if it would be of any interest and we'll see where we go from there.The way it came about - you have to put yourself back in the early days of computing, before everybody present in this room,except me, was born.Let's say something like1970-71 -- the very, very, early days of UNIX.The computer that UNIX ran on was a PDP 11. At that pointit was probably an 11/20. It was a machine that had very very little computing power. It didn't run very fast.It also didn't have very much memory.Probably something in the order of 32K,maybe 64K bytes and that's 64 Kbytes, not megabytes.And very small secondary storage as well, you know a few megabytes of disk and things like that.So, very very limited computing resources and that meant that a lot of the software that was in early days of UNIXtended to be fairly simple and straightforward.And, that reflected not only the sort of ... the relative 'wimpiness' ofthe hardware but also the personal tastes of the people doing the work,primarily Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie.So one of the prop ... one of the standard programs that people use is the text editor on any systemThe UNIX text editor was called 'ed', and it's not pronounced 'edd'At least by those in the know, it's pronounced 'ee dee'.And this was written by Ken Thompsonand I think it was a, basically, stripped-down version of aneditor called QED, which Ken had worked with and done a lot of work on earlier.So a very small, simple, straightforwardeditor and the thing that you have to remember is that, in those days, in additionyou didn't have actual video display terminals -not of the sort that we're used to today, or even 10 or 20 years ago.But in fact all the computing, all of your editing and so on, was done on paperRemember paper? If you zoom down hereyou can see paper! This meant that there were a lot of things that tried to minimize the use of paper.It also meant that editors worked one line at a time, or multiple lines at a time,but there was no cursor addressing, so you couldn't move around within a line.And so the 'ed' text editor reflected that kind of thing.Maybe what I should do is just a quick look at what 'ed' looked like? so the commands for 'ed' were single-letter commands.So, for example, there was a command called 'p',Which stood for 'print'; there was a command called 'd',which would delete a lineThere was a command called 's', which took a little bit ... which said 'substitute' so you could change thisy'know, 'ABC' into 'DEF', or something like that.There was an 'append' command that simply said 'add some more text' and you could add a bunch of lines and then terminate it with something.There was, of course, a 'read' commandso that you could read information from a file, and there was a 'write' command [so]that you could put it back in a file. a handful of other things like that. So that was the essence of what it did.One of the things that 'ed' did very nicely was that, OK, these apply by default to the current lineBut what do you do when you want to have more specification of what lines you're operating on?And so you could say things like 'line 1 to line 10 print'So, this would print the first to 10 lines. 10 was that.But suppose you wanted to print all of the lines in the file?So there was a shorthand called '$'. So, I could say '1,$p' and that would print all of the lines in the file.Or I could say: \"Gee! I wonder ... I just want to see the last line\".So I could say '$p' and that wouldgive me that. I could even elide the 'p', but that's good enough.Or I could delete the last line by saying '$d'. Or I could delete the first line by saying '1d'.That is sort of the line addressing. So far not very complicated.The thing that 'ed' added to all of that, and this is definitely Ken's influence was the idea of regular expressions.So, a regular expression is a pattern oftext - its a way of specifying patterns of text.They could be literal texts like the word 'print' or they could be something more complicated, like things that start with'Prin' and but might go on to 'Print' or 'Princeton' or 'Princess',or whatever, That kind of thing.And the way that regular expressions were written in the 'ed' text editor was you said '/' andthen you wrote the characters of the regular expression. So, I could say '/print/'and that would be something that would match the next line,in what I was working on, that contained the word 'print'anywhere within it.eSo the regular expressions in the 'ed' editor were somewhat different - a little moresophisticated, and complicated, than the regular expressions that you might find in shell wildcards,where, for example, a star means 'anything at all'. So,the same idea of patterns of text - a slightly differentspecification - a different way of writing patterns but suitable for text editing. And so, then, I could say things like \"I want to find the nextoccurrence of the word 'print' in my file\". And then there I would be.And on, and on, and on, like that. OK, so that's the 'ed' text editor.We are a long way away from 'grep' at this point. So what's 'grep' all about?Well, it turns out that at the time that this was going on, 'ed' was the standard text editor.But, as I said, the machines you're working on are very very wimpy.Not much computing capacity in a lot of waysAnd in factone of the limitations was that you couldn't edit a very big file,because there wasn't enough memory and the 'ed' worked entirely within memory andso you were stuck. One of my colleagues at the time, Lee McMahon, was very interested in doing textanalysis. The sort of thing that we would call today,perhaps, Natural Language Processing.And so what Lee wanted to do ... he had been studyingsomething that, at the time, was the very interesting question of who were the authors ofsome fundamental American documents called the Federalist Papers. The Federalist Papers were written by,variously, James Madison and Alexander Hamilton and John Jay in1787 and 88, if I recall correctly, There were 85 of these documentsBut they were published anonymously under the name Publius. And so we had no idea, in theory, who wrote themAnd so there's been a lot of scholarship trying to figure out for sure.It's well known who wrote some of them and others are still, I think, alittle uncertain and so Lee was interested in seeing whether you could actually,by textual analysis of his own devising,figure out who wrote these things. So that's fine. But it turns out that these 85 documents was in total just over a megabyte- I mean down in the noise by today's standards - wouldn't fit. He couldn't edit them all in 'ed'.And so what do you do?So one day he said: \"I just want to go through and find all the occurrences of 'something' in the Federalist Papersso I can look at 'em!\" And he said this to Ken Thompson andthen went home for dinner or something like that. And he came back the next day and Ken had written the program - and the program was called 'grep'. And what 'grep' did was to go through abunch of documents - one or more files - andsimply find all of the places where a particular regular expression appeared in those things.And so the way ... it turns out that one more of the commands in 'ed' is a command called 'g'. And this stood for 'global'.And what it said was, on every line that matches a particular regular expression -so, for example,'print'- I can then do an 'ed' command So, I could say: \"On every line that contains the word 'print'I'll just print it\". So, I can see what my various print statements would look like.Or I could, in some other way, say 'g' - and some other regular expression in there - and delete them. So I could delete all of thecomments in a program, or something like that.So the general structure of that is 'g' followed by (in slashes), a regular expression,followed by the letter 'p' - g/re/p - and that's the genesis of where it came from.OK, and so this is in some ways the genius of Ken Thompson.A beautiful program, written in no time at all, by taking someother program and just trimming it out and then giving it a name that stuck. That's the story of where 'grep' came from.Let me add one thing - 25 years ago [it] literally was the spring of 1993,I was teaching at Princeton as a visitor.And I needed an assignment for my programming class. And I thought \"Hmm!\"So what I did was to tell them - the students in the class: \"OK, here is the source code for 'ed' \"It was at that time probably1800 lines of C.\"Your job is to take these 1800 lines of C and convert them into 'grep' as a C program.OK, and you've got a week to do it\".And I told them, at that point, that they had a couple of advantages. First,they knew what the target was.Somebody had already done 'grep' so they knew what it was supposedto look like. And all they had to do was replicate that behavior.And the other thing is that it was now written in C. The original 'grep' was written in PDP 11 assembly language.And of course, they also had one grave disadvantage:None of them were Ken Thompson.",

   "title": "Animated GIFs and Space vs Time - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "02 Apr 2014",
   "transcription": "Animated GIFs have been around for a very long time. We're talking, like, early days of mass use of the web,so we're talking GeoCities, mid-90's technology here,and yet, they're still popular. They're still on every damn BuzzFeed article and every Tumblr there is,and the reason is because they work pretty much everywhere,and they're also a really good example of the tradeoff between space and timeor between memory and time in computing.Animated GIFs have been around so long that they're actually a verb now --officially recognized, \"GIF,\" or \"jiff\" if you wanna pronounce it the official way that's blatantly wrong.You can fight that one out in the comments.Um, they are a really inefficient way of storing video,'cause GIF wasn't designed as a format for storing what it's used for now, like actual videoclips.It was used for simple animations, and you can see that in the restrictions that it has.The whole gamut of colours that you can use on the web is actually the cube of the number of colours that you can use in a GIF.So a GIF will let you have 256 colours. The web, 256 values for red, for green, and for blue.Multiply those, you get 16,777,216 colours!That's how many you find in a photo.The GIF will only let you have 256, which is why you get that kind of weird, compressed, grainy effect.More than that, the colours don't change for each frame, again with rare exceptions using really advanced GIF-makers,but, generally, one palette for every frame.So if you go from a beautiful sunset with all those gorgeous yellows in itand then go to the ocean with lots of blues,you're gonna run out of colours very, very quickly.The other restriction with GIFs is frame rate.Uh, this video you're watching will be either 25 or 30 frames a second -- I don't know which one you're using.Um, GIFs generally don't go above 20,and, mm, rare to see anything above 10 or 15,which is where you get that slightly shaky effect from, the kind of juddery effect you see in a lot of GIFs.The reason for that is they were designed for animation, not for video.I mean, GIF is wonderful if what you want to compress are simple line drawings.If you want to go beyond that, not really all that good.The reason for that is GIF uses, well, very limited inter-frame compression.There are two types of compression you can use in video.Uh, there is inter-frame compression, which is what most modern formats use,and there is intra-frame compression, which is what GIF mainly uses.And these ones, \"inter-\" and \"intra-,\" you'll have heard before for, like, \"INTERgalactic space,\"where you have the space between galaxies,and \"INTRAgalactic,\" which is just the space within one galaxy,and it's an important distinction, 'cause inter-frame compression is how all modern video formats work,even back to the early MPEG ones and the, you know,that were being used at the same time as GIF was coming out.Uh, MPEG-2, which is what DVDs use,and MP4, which is almost certainly what you're watching right now,they all use inter-frame compression.And the idea is this: you get the first picture,which is, like, you know, regular photo compression, it's crushed down little,and then that picture isn't stored for about 25 frames more, until there's a major change.Until then, it just tracks the differences.So if I stay perfectly still, as still as I can, then all that the MPEG compression will do, pretty much, is my mouth.The rest of me, there'll be hardly any data compression there at allbecause, well, hopefully the rest of me isn't moving.On the other hand, if I start flailing about a lot like this, then suddenly --and, yeah, if you move the camera as well --suddenly, everything here is having to move. It's having to work a lot harder,and what it's doing, instead of changing every frame,instead of storing every single frame, it's saying,\"Right. In here, that big block of pixels that's red, that's that T-shirt,that's moved a bit that way and zoomed out a bit,and this pinkish block here that's the hand, that's moved that way a bit and the fingers moved.\"So it works out the differences between each frame.And occasionally it will store the entire image if that's more efficient,particularly on a quick change, if you suddenly zoom -- thank you! --um, then it will often go to a new keyframe there, as it's called.But generally, it will just track the differences between them.GIF isn't designed to do that. We're talking mid-90's here.Maybe it was possible to have a video stream going,but at the same time as you're trying to display a webpage,at the same time you're trying to track everything else going on in the system, no. You couldn't do that.So GIF was designed with mostly just intra-frame compression.Intra-frame compression is like storing a series of photographs.Each one is pretty much independent from the one before and the one after.Now, you can see why this is less efficient.You've got enormous space savings if you say that wall doesn't change at all.It has limited inter-frame compression.If nothing has changed in a pixel, you can just set it as transparentand the one from the previous frame will sort of show through.But other than that, if something changes, you have to encode it completely all over again,and this is is one of the basic tradeoffs of computer science,because in exchange for the extra file size, the extra  data that you're storing,it is a lot easier to decompress.Instead of having to worry about storing one frame and another and then managing the differences between themand all the little fiddly things that you have to do there,you just show a picture, and then you show another picture, and then another.Simple as that.GIF, in exchange for that extra file size, that poor compression, is actually really, really easy.I mean, back in the GeoCities days, you could have, you know, flaming skulls rotating on your webpage,an entire background of flames as many GeoCities sites including mine might well have doneI've just realised there are people watching this who aren't gonna remember GeoCitiesbecause they were born after it, which is really weird.Um, GeoCities was, um, I was about to say the MySpace of its day but, no,it was the Tumblr of its day.Um, they gave you free webspace and you wrote up the HTML code yourself and you uploaded it,and it was wonderful, and then it was bought by Yahoo!, and it was not wonderful anymore. Anyway!You see this tradeoff everywhere in computer science.Uh, if you have an app that has to do a really complicated calculation -- it might take a few seconds --you can either let it do that calculation each time,just send the formula to do that calculation off to the app,so the user types in whatever number they need, they hit a button, it does the calculation,three seconds later the response comes back to them,or you can make the app much, much bigger.You could include the result for every number they could possibly type in, precalculated, just calculated once beforehand,and, instead of sending them a formula, you send them a lookup table.It might be megabytes or gigabytes in size, but instead of having to do that calculation,you tradeoff the time for the space,and, instead of three seconds, you waste 500 megabytes --those are arbitrary numbers I pulled from anywhere --but the tradeoff is there.And the tradeoff is there in cryptography -- I've mentioned rainbow tables before:\"... rainbow tables ... which tradeoff computation time for hard drive space.So, rather than having to calculate millions and millions of hashes for this one password,someone has already done it for you.\"So you can spend, ah, days or weeks or months or years or millennia brute forcing a password,or you can use megabytes or gigabytes or terabytes of data to try and jump forward in the calculation.I'm summarizing here, and cryptography nuts will be extremely angry at me for doing that,but essentially it's the same tradeoff.Rather than processor time, you've traded off for space.It's one of the fundamental principles of computer science and it's best explained with animated GIFs.The thing about GIFs is it's one of those weird things where the medium defines the message.Like, movies have to be between about 90 minutes and three hours, depending on the genre.Uh, Vines have to be six seconds, well six-and-a-half seconds, actually.This one was determined by technology,by what bandwidth could support, by what file size was acceptable,and it's interesting to see something where it's not been decreed,it's not been agreed over time either.It's just whatever happens to fit into the technology.",

   "title": "Cross Site Request Forgery - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "03 Dec 2013",
   "transcription": "Cross site request forgery, CSRF, is the third big web attack. I've talked about cross site scriptingin the past. I've talked about SQL injection. This is number three, and it's the lesser-known one.Web browsers are fairly trusting things. I've said this before: if you give them some code to run,they don't cast a value judgment on it. They can't tell if it's malicious. They will just run it.Now, this was kind of okay in the early days of the web, when there wasn't online banking and things like that.The worst you could do is put a comment somewhere. Nowadays, bit more complicated.The web runs on data being sent back and forth, and that data can be encoded in a couple of ways.You can have what's called a GET request, and that's like if you look up, if you're using this on desktop,and you look up at the browser address bar, you'll see: youtube.com/watch, that's the name of the page,and then a ?v= a string of characters.That means that you're going to the watch page, and then the rest of that gets stripped off and sentto the logic at YouTube which says, oh, I want this video, so pull these details out of the database.There's another way of doing that, called POST, which is the kind of thing where you have a formwith a button at the bottom of it. And when you hit \"go\", then all that data gets bundled up and sentalong with the request, but not in the address bar. And traditionally, if you put it in the address bar,it's designed for fetching data. It's called a GET. So that means that you can take this YouTube URL,and copy and paste it to somewhere else. And just bundling the data up, like when you click \"go\" on a form,is called a POST. And that's meant for writing things, things that happen once. So that when you hit refreshor go back to the same page, it doesn't do the same thing twice. So if you enter a comment,it doesn't put all your comment's details in the URL bar, and you can't copy and paste that to a friend,and they all post the same comment. And that's reasonably good for the early days of the web,but since then, it's got a bit more complicated. Let's say you have a form on your website for an online bank.So let's design a really bad online bank form. Let's have, send some money from your accountto this account number, and send this much. And then there's a \"go\" button. And let's say thatas long as you're logged in, as long as you've been to all the authentication checks, and used that littlechip & PIN device that gives you a password to type in, you've got access to that form.You type in the account number, you type in how much you're transmitting, you select \"go.\"First of all, this won't use a GET request. It won't appear up top like YouTube does.It'll bundle it up in a POST, it'll send the request, and your bank will send back that it's done.But the trouble is, that form is, well, almost public. You know how it's designed. So let's imagine you set upa fake webpage somewhere else that has that form on it. And maybe, just maybe, you hide some of thosedetails, so they're already typed in. So it already has your account number in it, and, say, \u00a31,000.and then when someone comes along, and they want to put a comment on your website\u2014So let's design a really malicious blog.Let's, let's call it \"My Awesome Blog\".Let's write some really inflammatory content that people will love to comment on.And here, is a comment box.But off here, offscreen where they can't see it, or even completely invisible,is a box that says 'account number', prefilled with your account number; 'amount', a thousand pounds.I've written a hundred. Uhm, a hundred pounds.'Cause apparently my hand has lower ambitions than my brain does.And when you click that 'go' button, it's not going to My Awesome Blog.It goes to the really badly designed online bank.Which probably says: oh! We've got a request here!Don't know what this all blog nonsense is about, but look, we've got an account number, we've got some money - transfer it!Because we've already been authorized.Because you logged in to that online bank in another tab, while you were bored. And, well...Great. The money is gone.And it gets worse than that. Because, if you've noticed, when you type a comment on YouTube,You click \"Post\". It doesn't load the whole page back, like it used to in the early days of the web.Now, it does it all in the background, silently.And just sends a thing back, saying \"Yeah.\"\"That's fine. No worries.\"Well, that would work with this too.You wouldn't even need to click the 'go' button.It could just be that when I load up my site, My (malicious) Awesome Blog,it just creates that form in the background and sends off that request.There's a few things in browsers designed to stop you from doing that, but there are ways around them.Now, that's obviously quite a big problem.Online banks are generally not designed that way, unless they are designed incompetently.But a lot of web forums, a lot of smaller sites have problems like that.If you've ever designed something with a delete your account button,then frequently, it just goes to something like /delete. With maybe, you know, ?confirm=true on it.And you assume that the only time that form would be visible, is when the user is logged in,and has clicked: No, I really want to delete my account. I could copy that 'delete your account' formand just put it in the background of my completely irrelevant web page somewhere else.And you wouldn't even see if it fired, because it's all happening in the background using modern web technologies.And, you wouldn't notice. It would delete your account quietly in the background because that form,that 'delete you account' form or that transfer the money form, hasn't checked where the request is coming from.There was something in what's called HTTP, the hypertext transfer protocol,the very basics of the web, designed to stop this and it's called the Referer header.and it means, that when you click a link or submit a form, it includes the thingsit says Referer: this site.So you know if the form  request is coming from the actual online bank, or the actualdelete your account form, and not some malicious site elsewhere.The trouble is, if you start checking for that, a lot of users start complainingbecause that Referer header isn't always sent like it should. Maybe you've got an adverb blockeror maybe you've got some kind of privacy tool that's blocking that as well.The way to get around that, is a one time key. What the Americans call a nonce, and which the British definitely do not call a nonce.The one time key works, by the form on your website generating a unique code.It can be anything, just a random string of characters, each time you create the form.And then storing that [string of characters] and saying right, anything that comes back,anything that I see, needs to have this token with it.and this code, this token you've generated is in the form as well.Completely hidden, invisible to the user is something that says, token: random string of characters.I think I just wrote a number plate. Uhm, this random string is meaningless, but what it representsis that this form that I just made and I just sent out to the user, is the one that's coming back.So meanwhile, on My (malicious) Awesome Blog, I don't know what this token is, I can't possibly knowwhat this token is, because it changes per user and it changes every time the form is requested, or at leastevery few minutes. And if you copy that form, if you take that token and try and use it 5 minutes later or10 minutes later or when the form has already been submitted, or for a different person, or for any one of these thingsThen I'll look at that token and I'll go: that's wrong. I'm not having that (?) and suddenly,Cross Site Request Forgery doesn't work anymore. And there're still theoretical attacks and lucky fluxthat could get past this, but in general, that solves it. So if you're designing web forms for anything which is permanentanything like deleting an account, posting a comment, authorizing someone, or even transferring money, if you're not using this,this is a pretty big security hole, and if the sites you're using aren't using this, well...you now know what might happen when you go to some malicious blog somewhere out there.So that's Cross Site Request Forgery, and it is the third attack and everyone knows about XSS,if you're a web developer, Cross Site Scripting (XSS) is the one you know about.SQL injection, database attacks are the one you know about, but this...This one went under the radar for a long time, and there's still a lot of developers that don't know about it.So if you're designing a site, or using a site that has anything kind of permanent to it, have a lookand see if a token is being sent. 'Cause if it isn't, might be a bit of a security hole there.You start with a script tag and then everything stops,  you've got a closing script tag down here.Nothing in this section will actually appear on the user's screen...Now let's say I type in \"Tom\" with a quote mark in it...",

   "title": "Deep Dream (Google) - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "26 Aug 2016",
   "transcription": "Yeah, we've been late to the partyGoogle Deep Dream has been out for a while, but...it follows so nicely from our neural network talks.Let's talk about how it works.Google Deep Dream is a strange computer programthat outputs...kinda psychodelic, trippy images.This is one of the Google's gallery,and it's some kind of...strange... I mean...what is it? We don't know...Kinda strange...There's sort of a viaduct here,and that looks like a fountain...and some grass...Weird, sort of artistic image, but generated entirely by computer.Now, at the time this came out,most people where having lots of funplaying with this,and playing with online generators...But no one, you know, reallytalked about, deep down, how it worked.Kinda looks like sort of digital Salvador Dal\u00ed, doesn't it?It does a bit, yeah.And I think we quite instinctivelyquite like the ideaof computers can do art,in some way...For what it's worth that's notquite art yetI don't think, but we...we... you know,it's a bit of fun.It also has an insterestingimplications as towhat a neural network is doing underneath.But we talked about, a bit,doing the video where welooked into a network,and so it classified digits.This is a similar kind of thingwhere you can seethat the lower level layersare doing some thingsand the higher level layers aredoing other things.So let's try and break downwhat it's doingand then we can seesome funny imagesI've run on myself.Now, Google's \"GoogLeNet\"(which is the name for Google's networksthat they released,I think in... 2012,as part of the ImageNet competition)is quite complicated, right?They have these modules ofgroups of convolutional layerscalled \"Inception modules\"which is a very cool namefor something which is...probably not quite as cool as thatbut... it's a cool name.The idea is you godeeper and deeper intothe network and you getmore and more powerfulin classification outof it, ok?But, at its core,it's still a classification network.So it's saying:\"What is this a picture of?\"\"It's a picture of a cat.\"Right?\"A hundred percent confident:picture of a cat, definitely...\"\"Oh, no, it could be a dog.\"Right? So...What I'm do is:I'm gonna draw a networkBut I'm gonna draw mysort of standard...multi-layer network(but it's got nothingto do with convolutionsand nothing to do withGoogLeNet)because it's easier to visualize.So I'm over-simplifying it,but on the other hand......the same things apply to thissmall network I'm going to draw,as to the big network.So, remember that we havesome input neurons hereand then we have some intermediate neuronsand then, finally, our output neurons.Now, if people've been back tothe videos we did on this,this neuron here calculatesa weighted sum of all these neurons,and this one calculatesa weighted sum of all these neurons.So, if we were going back to our house analogy, all right?This one here could be number of windows,this could be square footage,this could be if it's got a pool or not, right?And this is taking some combinations of those thingsand trying to start to work towardsthe price of the house.And this one takes some combination of those combinationsand starts working towards the price of the house.Now, when we talked aboutconvolutional networksthese neurons where replaced withimage convolutions,like Sobel edge detedections,and other things, right?Where the actual convolutions them selves have learned.So, the early layers are going to be findinglines and corners and things like these.Later on we are gonna start to findobjects, boxes, circles,things that have multiple linesand corners as part of them.And finally, as a top, we start to movetowards actual objectswe are trying to classify.Cats and dogs and bikes.And then finally we get an ouptutthat lights up if it's a cat, right?That's the key.I mentioned this very briefly in a video,and I'm gonna mention it here again,very brieflybecause backpropagation is notfor a computerphile video,there's a lot of detailed analysis ofbackpropagation onlinefor people who is interested in it, right?It's fairly mathematically complex,It talks a lot about partial derivatives,and multivariable calculus and things like this.We won't be doing any of that in this video,so please don't turn off..., right?But the only theory is thatif we put an image in it at this pointwe can calculate these weighted sumsand we can propagate it throughand get a value out that sayshow much of a cat is in this image, right?It's essentially what we are doing.When we actually want to train this network to do something.What we do iswe know we are looking for a catso we try and change these weightsto better predict it.So we have something calleda \"cost function\" here, C,and what we're trying to do,is we're trying to work outhow we affect Cby changing this particular weight here...So, some relationship betweenthe weights and the cost function.Now...when we train a neural network what we dois we try and minimize this cost function.So the cost function might be somethinglike prediction accuracy,or euclidean distance, orsome sort of softmax, right?But the point is that this gives us a value of how good our guess is,and then we alter all or weights going backwardsto say, let's change these weights a bitso that that error goes downand we get a little bit closer to do our prediction,right?So we go forward to get our prediction,we calculate the errorand we propagate the error backwards.So, that's all the background you're gonna needto know how Google Deep Dream works.What Google Deep Dream does is...forget the cost function completely.We've already trained the networkWhat we want to dois maximizethese values here,or these values here. So...Think about it...if this is a picture of a cat, right?So, I'm putting in a picture of a cat here.Then, what's gonna happen is it's gonnacrossweight the sum,and then, one of the cat neurons is gonna light up.Right?But also, if you think about this layer,if we are working on it backwards,it might be because this one lit up,which is maybe \"there's ears\",and this one lit up, which is maybe \"paws\".And maybe this one lit up because herewas \"a few lines in a row\",and this one is sort of \"fury texture\",or something, you know.And we're getting lower and lower levels,we go through,and in the end it's because this one lit up,which is \"edges\"and this one lit up which is \"corners in a certain place\".The values in here influence the values here, and here, and here, and here...and then end up converging on our thing.So, what we want to do to makeour Google Deep Dream imagesis change the image to make these bigger, right?So this is the amount of \"ear\" in our image.If we can just make that as big as possible,we can say \"more ears please!\"...- \"There's a bit of ears going on there...\"\"Well I want more.\"\"I want more ears, I want more paws, I want more bits of cat.\"So instead of minimizing this cost function,we're maximizing the sum of these,or the squared sum of these.Let's not do anymore maths, right?Let's look at some pictures.I have my landscape image.Now, if it's looking very boring to you,it's because I havn't passed this throughGoogle Deep Dream yet, right?But what I'll do is:I'll pass this input into the Google Deep Dreamand for every area in the imageit starts to light up some of these neurons.Because maybe, although this isn't the picture of a cat,maybe there are some kind of \"catty\" features in it.You know, like the edge of a leaf mightbe kind of the same shape as an ear,or this texture, this grass,kind of the same texture as fur.So, some of the same neurons are gonna light up,right?So what we do is we've been trying to make those biggerby altering our input image, ok?So just like we were trying...train our network to get better,we train our image to get better,to be more of these features.Now, of course...this network is trained on lots of thingsother than cats,so anything that looks at all plausibleit's gonna try and maximize that effect.So, this is a picture I run through it,here, ok?We've done some strange things.In the sky here we've got what kinda looks like buildings appearingAnd then down here we've gotsome animals appearing,And s...I don't know what that is!Some sort of... dalekAnd then this weird animal here,if we zoom in on that...I mean... it's anybody's guesswhat kind of animal that is.But this is what's so cool about Google Deep Dream:it's you don't know what you're going to getand it's going to depend on your input image.So... you know...The features that it found in the input image...\"Oh, that feature looks a bit like a bunch of lines,which in turn look a bit like...the edge of a cat's head......make it look more like that.\"And if you keep doing this processit starts to converge on weird animalsthat have interesting features.- So is that multiple iterations?Yes! I think it does about...40 iterations by default.So it... tweaks the weights of the image40 times.An actual fact, Google Deep Dreamdoes it at different scales, as well.But we've... I sort of blush over thatbecause it's not hugely important,but it runs a small version of the image first,makes it a bit bigger and runs it again,makes it a bit bigger and runs it again.So you could then take this image,and put it back into the funand make it more: \"I want moreof this weird shapes and weird animals\".So I take this image and I put it in,and I get something that's really weird.So, it's the same, but just more of it.It bears no ressemblance with it,I mean, there's a tiny bit of tree left here...But this...it bears very little ressemblance to our original image,apart from this generic area of ground and the sky...But on the other hand, we've got all kinds of...there's a weird car appearing hereand some actual full own buildingsstarting to appear.Because, later on in this network,some of these neuronsare going to be representing building shapes.And so it's trying to make it \"more building shape\".What's this for? Right?Why are we doing this?I mean... that's a question you've got to ask Google,cause I'm not entirely sure...But no, it's...There are two things...It's fun, right? so...Mostly it's fun.Most people aren't interested in what neuralnetwork is doing underneath,they like cool, trippy images.One of the probles with neural networks isthey are a black box.So we... design them with an architectureand then we run them,and they get... I don't know...80% accuracy on some task,and that's very good,and then we say no more about it.We now have a program that canclassify these things at 80% accuracy.In many ways we don't really care about how it did it,(if it does it).But, if we want to improve these thingsbeyond the 80%,and beyond 90%,and getting better and better...It's a good idea to try and understandwhat's going on underneath.So there are some papers out there,Google working on it developed papers as well,that are trying to understandwhat it is that the lowestlayers of the network are doingand the highest layers of the network are doingfor different tasks.Intuitively the lowest levels are edges in things...and, with we go up, hierarchical group of these things,so... buildings and so on.One thing you could do... is you could...instead of maximizing this layer,which represents very high level objects,we can maximize one of the layers down herewhich maximizes edges and things.So here's another pictureof Google Deep Dream that I've maximizeda lower layerSo you can see that instead ofstarting to form objects,it's now just starting to formpatterns of lines and textures.And that's because that's the only thingthat's described at this lower level of a network.- So now we are on Van GoghYeah, right?So yeah... impressionism, huh?This is much better I can paint, as well.The idea is the lower levelsof a network are doing things like this....And the higher layers of a networkare looking for more complex objects.That's basically what neural network does.This network has been trained onsomewhere around defined and closed objectsso cats, dogs, bikes, people, buildings and so on.This network that I showed at the beginningis trained only on buildings,which is why many of the thingsthat have been generated in itlook like buildings.Often...some of the objects you seestart to look very similarSo you've got a building here that looks like a building,And that one that looks kinda similarwith this spike on.And that's because the network's been trained on certain objectsand these objects get a good responseand then it maximizes those things.So the question was then:What if I want to generate an imagethat makes it look more like a cat?Specifically a cat, rather than justcats and dogs and buildingsand bikes, and all this different things.So what we do is we put a cat image into it,into the networkand we find out which of these light up,for a cat,specifically a cat, right?And then we...instead of maximizing all of them,we maximize only those ones, ok?So we're basically saing \"now...\"...more of it, please...\"\"...but more of only the specificinteresting cat ones.\"I chose cats because people on theInternet have a lot of pictures of catsThey're very easy to obtain...So I put in a picture.Here's some pictures,Some cats I put in.So, when I put this into the image,into the neural network,it's going to classify this as a cat, or multiple cats.And it's going to that by finding combinations of features that look like cats.So if I pin down the learning to do this,I can start to make my image look more like a cat.So you can see that some eyes have appeared,there's a kinda... nose hereThat looks... let's face it,it's not really a cat,but it's more a cat than the landscape was.It's a pretty weird image,all things considered.And this is a high level.If we do the same thing for a lower layer,we can't get all that hierarchicalsort of ears plus eyes plus nose.We can only get the low level things.So we can say do this one,which is almost entirely fur and eyes.Right? so...you can see that the clouds kinda look a bit like fur,so it's made them look more like thatand the eyes... all down here.So, this is a different kind of image that we produced,by trying to make it look a bit like a cat,but only at low level,so, you know, what are the low levelfeatures that make a cat.Ok? How strange!And finally, you can do it to people,so I put in a picture with some people's faces.And... out we getthis incredibly weird...picture of sort of weird...harpy baby things...that kinda...gives me nightmares.You could argue, in some wayswe're gaining in intuition aboutwhat the lower levels do,what the higher levels do.Predominantly, it's just for fun.There are other papers that do...an outputting of network layers and tryingto work out what it is that each layer is doingbut in this way it just...generates cool images.So, if you want to use Google Deep Dream,you just need an input imageand maybe a reference imagelike a cat to target it towards,but really you don't need much more than that.And then you can just get going on it.- Is there a website or something?So... no, so, actually, it's, it'spython code which goes into caffewhich is a deep learning library.So that's how I generated these images.People have obviously put a website frontend on this,it's very easy to find websites that do the same thing.But in actual fact, they would justbe running the source code back behing the scenes.If you look for the source code,it's actually not very long.because this process ofbackpropagation is alreadycoded up in these libraries.So what we need to do is telling...instead of maximi... minimizing this Cwe wanna maximize the value of these things.And you just change a few numbers around,and send it backwards through the network.It's, you know, not...It sounds complicated, but really actually isn't that complicatedonce you actually look at the code.(other video reproducing)",

   "title": "Krack Attacks (WiFi WPA2 Vulnerability) - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "17 Oct 2017",
   "transcription": "Dr. Steve Bagley:- So on Monday the 16th of October, 2017,two researchers of the Belgian University releasedinformation of an exploit that they've foundfor the security mechanism used on all majorWi-Fi connections these days.So this is WPA, the encryption protocol that wasbrought in to replace the early one,WEP, which was basically useless.So this one has been proven to be mathematically correct.It's been proven to be mathematicallysecure and so it was thoughtthat you wouldn't be able to attack it. And for the last 15 years or sothere's been a few fringe effects that you could exploit to get certain things,but in general, it's secure. Until yesterday \ud83d\ude32The way that WPA works is thatwhen the client, your computer, connects to the base station initially starts offunencrypted and very quickly they exchange a series of messages between the twowhich get them so they've agreed on a key that they're going to use to encrypt the message.And so to understand how this attack works we need to understand how those messages are transmitted,and then how that's used to encrypt the data, which is why I brought Mikealong to sort of help talk about the encryption side of thingsHello, MikeDr. Make Pound:- Hello!What am I doing here?- So what we've got open on the computer here is Iset wireshark going when I turned on my Wi-Fi cardIt's captured a series of packets and what we can see hereis there are four packets of information that are sentbetween the computer and the access point andThese effectively agree the shared key that they're going to use.now this isn't the password you put into your Wi-Fi router.One of the interesting things that this attack workswithout ever necessarily getting hold of your password.So we end up with four messages that are being sent between the base station andYour computer to establish those things.So if we have a look at them,we got our computer here, and we haveThe access point here, or the base stationand we've associated with it,so the first thing to set up the encryption is that the access pointsends a message across, and we'll call this Message 1.This contains various information in there including a random numberwhich is used, and a counter which is used for something else.But we won't go into too much detailAnd then we reply with our random number which is Message 2They send Message 3 which contains a bit more information, and then we sendMessage 4 which basically says,\"Yep. I got that. The communication is now established.\"Now the way the Krack Attack works is by sitting in the middle you have another computer,which is your malicious actorwhich is going to sit there to try and break into this encryption, and he has to sit in such a way that he canknow when Message 3 is sent and stop Message 4 being sent back- Sean: What does he do? Block it or something?- Dr. Bagley: I mean basically the way this worksIs that you need to cause Message 3 to be received by the computermore than once in a way that you know aboutand you've got access to things and if you do that you can start capturing dataand you can use some of the techniques that Mike's going to talk aboutto decrypt the information.So one way you could do it is you could perhapssplat a bit of noise on to the Wi-Fi signal at that point.There are easy ways where you pretend to bea base station and quickly send a message saying,\"Switch to me on a different channel because I've got better communications here,\"which means you receive itAnd the other base station doesn't and then it sends it outand you could sort of forward it on.So there's various ways you could probablypush this into into use, but basically once you've got in here, and you caused this to be resentit causes parts of the values that the computer uses to encrypt the messagesTo be reset as well and once you've done that you can get into a position where you can actually start todecrypt the messages.Dr Mike Pound:- When the client receives message 3,That's a moment it thinks right I've got my keys now. I can store them away ready for encryptionThe problem is that if the access point doesn't receive message 4, it thinksOh well something must have happened to it. So I'll send message 3 again to make sure the client got it .The bugs that these researchers have found is that if message 3 gets resent, it restores the keyand in doing so also resets all of the other cryptographic variables it's been working with, which is a real problemIn particular it's a problem when you reset something called the nonce, or a number used once.So the way we usually encrypt in WPA is through AES, advanced encryption standardand we do it in counter mode generally speaking because it's quite fast soIf you think back to the video we did onXOR andStream ciphers we basically use AES as a stream cipher so we have an ever-increasing counterLet's say it starts at one, and we encrypt these numbers with our AES block cipherHere's our key coming in hereSo this one when encrypted using this key will produce a block of AES encrypted data that's random.So basically we're generating here a set of random numbers that goes on like this from the first blockand then the second, and then the third and so on all the way alongBut it's not a truly random thing because if I know the key and I can still get want to generate the same, yeahAnd so I mean, that's aboutUnfortunate is the problem with cryptography is that we couldn't ever use truly random because we wouldn't be able to decrypt it againWe have our message bits, which are you know naught, 1, 1, naught, something differentAnd we XOR these together one bit at a timeAnd that's how we encrypt and the nice thing is to decrypt we basically regenerateThis key stream and do the exact process againwe XOR our ciphertext and get our message back out. Now counter mode is very very fast andIt's perfectly secure if your block cipher produces nicely random bitsunlessYou reuse the numbers in which case it's completely broken. In this attack, remember,We're resetting the nonce because we're sending message 3 the client sees this and goes,\"Oh I better restart  my encryption from start from scratch again.\"So this number goes back to one, or goes back to zero somewhere at the beginning, and so we're generating the exact same key streammultiple timesWe start by cryptic some data using the key starting at 1 2 3 4 and then it gets resetand we encrypt some different data with 1 2 3 4Q: So normally it doesn't go around like 1 2 3 4, 1 2 3 4. It literally keeps --It will just keep counting up and obviously the theoretical limit will be the128-bit number that you're trying to store. That's unlikely to happen in the time you're connected to the Wi-FiBut it's a theoretical possibilityIf they use one multiple times you can probably work out what? -- yeah,so if you imagine that we've used one multiple timesThe same keys been used, because the key didn't get changed, then the same key stream of zeros and ones have been XOR our messageand that's very very weak when we use the same key twice we can essentially nullify the key by XOR in two messages together andThen we do a very similar process become something called crib dragging so we will come up with hypothetical bits of plaintextwe think let's say the word HTML orSomeone's login name or something like this, and we will slide it over the message untilIt gets a hit and at that pointWe know not only where it isBut also what the keystream bits for that position were. So it's not a completely trivial processBut on our computer it can be bruteforced incredibly quickly. If you reuse the samecounter twice with the same key in something like counter modeIt's such a huge problem because basically you can extract plaintext bits from multiple messagesOnce you've started to do that then you've got some idea of what we've sent you might be able to predict what they're going tosend and sort of get in and start doing replay attacks and things like this orinjecting information in, but we've done all this without even knowing what the key was. So it's an interesting part of encryption whereYou aren't necessarily secure just because the key is secret right and in this case very much not the caseThe other issue is that some of these modes you can extract theAuthentication key as well so when we talked about HMACWe had a secret key that we used to make sure the message hadn't been interfered with. Well, if we can find that keyWhich you can using this attack, then you can start to forge your own messages. Start to, let's say, add in TCP packets ofHTML that conveniently holds some JavaScript that runs some ransomware for example, and then you know you're in businessAnd we've done that without knowing what the key is. One questionWhat would happen if this key was zero?Here when we're generating this counter what happen if the key was zero. If the key is zeroThen you're encrypting one with zeros it will still produce a random output, but it'll produce a random outputThat's always the same, and we will know what it isSo we could we could guess the key stream. And if we knew were in the key stream thenWe could generate the right values generate the right packets. The way thisPlays out is on certain operating systems. It basically has no effect so Windows. IOS. It seems because of the way theyFollow or don't quite follow the standard it seems that this has limited effect.There are still ways you can attack things, but it has a limited effectSo you'll say people on Windows laptops and on iOS devices should be alright?They are safer than other devices the problem comes with themThe program that does it in Linux and on certain Android friends so the implementation used on Linux and AndroidThat clears the key out of memory which is a good thing to do because if you're sitting in a coffee shop when you goAfter buy a coffee it's notimpossible to plug the device quickly, a Thunderbolt device to do it into the side of the machine and copy thebit of memory out of there, which is perhaps got the key in itAnd then we can decrypt your traffic so that makes sense the problem is thatWhen you replay message 3Which you need to do to make the attack workThat also resets the counter, the things that Mike's talked about, and it now uses the key which is 0 toStart encrypting these things so actually you end up with a known sequence of counters being generatedWhich means that you can then as well as decrypt the messages you can sort ofinsert data into that message stream and start sending things to you that you perhaps weren't expecting to get. So on certain operating systems, it'sRelatively benign on others it's more dangerousBut it's also worth remembering that we should still use WPA2 to encrypt things because the alternative is that you have no securityAnd that even if someone does come and do this they could do exactly the same by unplugging your base station and plugging ina new device into the Ethernet the other side of thatand listen there anyway, so it's the risk, it needs to be patchedIt'll be patched, and then we can all go back to using Wi-Fi and browsing the webThose leaks happen all the time and so passwords are being just dumped into the internet all the time, so there's this password list called RockYouWhich is a bit of a game changer in password cracking if that's a thing like-- 50But this is the IBM pc/xt the model 51 60 which came out two years later in 1983So this is really what the first PC was like--",

Linux man.At the moment, it is still, for me, PC plus Linux.But at some vague stage in the near future, I may capitulate and go for a fully Mac solution.In the course of doing these videos for you, I've seen people catch sight of an Apple on what they thinkis my desk. Well, I have to say, sadly, it's not mine. It belongs to my colleague because we share this roomand he's not in very often. But when he is, he uses the Apple Macintosh.And yet- Well, I've also confused you totally by referring to the fact that I run openSUSEand I also have a straightforward Windows 7 PC.I use Windows, which is a fairly controversial decision amongst my friends.But there is not a Mac laptop that actually does what I want it to.There's not a Mac laptop with a significant enough graphics card that will workand no decent video editing software on Linux. so...I've been preaching for years that one should be using the same machineand the people actually produce the machine, they also produce the software so they are compatible.And meanwhile, was using Windows on a Dell.And one day I decided, it was enough of crashes and my blackbay not communicating with Dell.So I said, \"That's it.\" I moved to Mac and all done.PC\"Okay, how's that then?\"Hehehe, *inaudible*Apart from Steven, Steven's a real Mac fan.Mac, most of the time, at the moment.\"Yeah, well, any reason for that?\"Um, at the time, good full factor- for the hardwareUm, pretty well madeUm, the software is no more exasperating than PC, so far, soHaving done, the Mac, and, um, more aboutThe Mac age 30 years and so onI have to say, they're still not my first choiceThey were back in the eighties but, let's try andOffend everybody, or let's try and mollify everybody.Had I been a graphic designer, and not a computer scientistI would certainly have gone for a MacBecause all of the things that matter to Graphic DesignersWorked really, really wellAnd they were designed, for the Mac, first of all, and it shows in everything they do.I'm the only one in the office that uses the AppleAnd, I get slicied? for it, soThey're all Windows guys around hereI've always used a PC and, um, Apple, are very expensiveUm, and they have a rather draconian warranty systemThat, I'd like to avoidJust, I'm kind of fond of Mac phone thingIt's historical, I've been, on a PC for, many, many milleniumI think the problem for real computer scientistsWas the Macintosh was good, but it was signle user, it was for Graphic DesignersIt didn't participate in the world of networked Unix m achinesUm, linux, *cough* *chuckle*\"PC, PC not Mac?\"Um, well no, whatever architecture, any architectureI like the ??? chromebook, I'm a massive Google fanboyAnd um, other than that I like the- it's the nicest, linux PC you can getI'm Mac these days.\"Ok, any particular reason?\"Yeah first I was linux, and then I found, too much hassleInstalling sound drivers, and whatever, and updating operating systems and moved to MacI have just always have used PCsAnd, you know, I'm not against Macs, particularly, but umYeah PCsI was a bit annoyed with Mac and those, ermCopyright, *inaudible*\"Digital Theft\", I call thisThe Macintosh didn't participate in the world of networked Unix machinesUntil relatively late on, and as many of you know that came about with Steve Jobs forming NeXTNeXT was built on a Unix-like system, and so now that it's come full circleSteve Jobs came back to Apple, brought this Unix-type system with himThen all of a sudden, yes, now, I can live on a Mac, quite happilyAnd colleague Steve, is an absolute raving Mac enthusiast for just that reason*chuckle*Are there other computers?It's totally Unix-based, you can have the best of both worldsYou can have the graphic richness, you can have a Unix-like environment as well",

   "title": "Punch Card Programming - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "21 Aug 2013",
   "transcription": "The thing you used to dread more than anything else was to take these out of the box in which youcarefully stacked them upand then accidentally dropped them on the floor. There is no quicker wayto discover what n factorial means when you start trying to put them back together in the right order Armed only with your knowledge of ALGOL programs and which order these things must have occurred inWe have here in the department a legacy deck of punch cards dating at my best guess from about1971 it was left behind by aStatistic student of that era can act in it just is like a blast from the past We'll put this on the classic black background provided by the cover of an iPadWhat could be better old meets new?At the top of the deck we used to have to put a colored cardBasically stating who we were and what this job was aboutNow I think the first thing to draw your attention to on any sample of these cards isYou look at them against the light and if you remember that a card reader is readingvertically to get its characters [boom]Run like that not horizontally... The most amazing thing you then discover which threw me for a while because I'd rather forgottenIt works like this is that if you now put the card down on a black backgroundAnd will use another card as a ruler just look what happens every singlecharacter andif you look very carefully aswell as the whole patternThat denotes a character it can also be printed out at the top of the card although the printing Ribbon was pretty faded withoutthesenevermind every single character has got adifferent hole punch pattern but there's never more than two holes that are punched. Now that might seem very strangeand as I say I gave me a jolt at all. How on Earth does that getconverted into a character code which is going to be a bit pattern representing an ASCII characteror whatever you can't just port ASCIIcharacter punching down here if you did you get into all sorts of problems.Because some ASCII characters have got lots of one bits in themand if the situation is that you chose that every one bit was a holesome characters would make this thing look like confetti. It would be like having aterraform... you know the [beasts] [only] [holes]... that the actual mechanical substrate of the card will be very fragileSo this is the reason that there arevarious choices of two holes here out of 11 rows in totaland that gives enoughcombinations to give aunique code fora fairly limitedalphabet admittedly, but it worksSo perhaps another thing to point out is that these arecards for anICL 1900 computer which was mentioned in the previous videoThe ICL 1900 seriesinternally did not hold its characters in 8 bits as would be donenowadays. It held them in 6 bitsSo pretty well all of you out there are familiar with the fact that nowadays if you likethe standardfor years has been that you have a computerwhose integers are held in 32 bits?but if you want those 32 bit entities called words are broken up intofour 8-bit bytesNowadays, it's the bytes that are addressed not the words and that particular architecture of byte address machines beenoptionally groupable into longer units to hold eitherinstructions or integers or whatever that really did start with IBM mainframes they were the first to go in for byte addressing and 8-bit bytesICL on the other hand did not have 32-bit words with four 8-bit characters it had24-bit words with four 6-bit characters. Why are here you cry the answer is it's cheaperYou've got rather less memory to provide rathersimpler adders to do you only need 6-bit adder circuitry not 8-bit adder circuitry andit's as simple as thatLCL could make their computers a little bit cheaper than IBM although they were arguably as well a little bit slower and so onSo this is what these hole punchings are all about.They are equatingby specialized circuitry in the card reader to it being able to recognize these patterns and say ohThat's the 6 bit character such-and-such, and it will put that into a temporary file behind the scenesNow when you're preparing these card decks you really did have to take huge careFirst of all the yellow card announces that this is a job for the computer to do - big surprise thereThere's a NUPMSThey're Nottingham (?) University Physics and Maths I think that stands for. This is ken's identifierPMSKA for Ken Akin (?), and I think this thing at the endannounces the global terminator for this deck of cards which will come right at the bottom for our [perros]OkayThen there's a little piece of job control herebasically saying I want the Nottingham (?) University EXECutive program which was our own sort ofhomebrew addition to ICL's GEORGE operating systemAnd you notice at the end here. It says BY C in thisadded module to the operating systemYou could say how desperatelyurgent this job was or not. You were given a certain number of notional pounds to spend every month for every user.And you could opt to spend less money and have it run at low priorityBut you could either spend it by a which meansI want the job doing right nowOr you could say I'll go overnight and you were charged as a much lower rate. The next card we see hereannounces that this is an ALGOL job, the following cards will be in the ALGOL languageSo this is a signal to the operating systemthough to read all this in but when it's been read in it has to be fed in to the ALGOL compiler and theoperating system knows where that's kept you don'tunlikeUnix Linux, whatever these days you don't get very close to the operating system. It's thereIt doesn't do much for you except run your jobsYou just have to trust to it more or lessNotice here for those of you at all familiar with things like ALGOL and PascalIt's beginning to look fairly sensible: BEGIN. That's a reserved word in the ALGOL languageIt's a bit like open curly-brace (\"{\") in CBut ALGOL use BEGIN and END instead of open curly (\"{\") and closed curly (\"}\")Notice that it's signaled as being a reserved special word because it uses prime orSingle quote symbols, it's quote begin quote ('BEGIN')Quote procedure quote ('PROCEDURE'). That's another reserved word in the ALGOL languageAnd it's defining this procedure E01AAA with theseformal parametersor arguments. There we are then you're sitting in front of a card punch you type in just like you would do on aordinary keyboard these days except this thing is electromechanicalSo it's going to splash splash splash splash all the time. Every character you hit is punching out holeselectromechanically and at the same time is hammering out a typewriter record on the top ofexactly what all these holes mean.Every time you hit the return keywhereas even on the dumb terminal you find the cursor going zonk back fromfrom the right hand side of the screen to the left as you look at itwhat would happen when you hit return on one of these is that the card would as if by magic?Be taken away from the punching station and propelledI think with sort of compressed air to a catcher traySo one after another you would build up a stack of cards in orderThat would later be fed into the machine So when it's all completed and of course the advantage is with having these things written out on top if you could see any mistakes ona quick scan through you can always punch another card and replace the bad card with a good cardYou would end up with a job to be submitted can stack is a particularly short oneIt just seemed to be running this routine and using it to generate a small amount of data to be printed outSo there we are, a very very small job.In order to stay sanewhat you need to do is the following?First of all decide whether your card punch like to have these beveled corners at the top left or top rightFaintly recall that ICL and IBM probably did them different ways around, but that was the thing to help you get your cards aligned andstop you turning one accidentally upside down andthereby reading in the wrong hole pattern in the wrong orderYou used to make sure the bevels werein place and like that, so that's oneself-protection mechanismAnother one that was optionally available on some better quality card punches with support at the far right of the cardtypically, I think in columns 72 to 80 because these are 80-columned cardsYou could put a sequencing number here, okay? You can have them automatically sequence the numbered as youpunch them out on the card punchThe thing you used to dread more than anything else was to take these out of the boxin which you carefully stacked them up and then accidentally dropped them on the floorThere is no quicker way to discover what n factorial means when you start trying to put them back together in the right orderarmed only with your knowledge of ALGOL programs and which order these things must have occurred inSo all sorts of subterfuge is used to be used, but the best was to have themnumbered if possible and then if you could afford one of these things that were actuallycard collecting machines where if you put in a randomized of cards they could electromechanically sort them for youI can't recall I ever used one of those perhaps. I was careful enough or perhaps the university couldn't afford oneI don't know. Another common trick to use which I'm actually portmarker pen markings at the top of these if you did or you wrote a word hereYou could get them broadly back in the correct order by just making your patterns at the top lookcorrect and get them back in roughly the way they should have been. So here we have you see a muchmore substantialALGOL job, I think most of this is programmedthere's a little bit of data at the bottom.-So would you have one of these cards for every line?would that be kind of...- Every line of the program?Yeah, would have a card.-Line and you could only fit one line for your copy.-Yeah, yeah, one lamp guard. Right at the end of this lodge of stuffLet's put it down here as a separate card of its ownyou see that magic word END and that is the final end of the programAnd just as in other languages you're open (\"{\") and closed curly braces (\"}\") can be nested inside each otherSo also in ALGOL the BEGIN END blocks could be nested inside one anotherSo that END then is the final card of the programBut then look what happens you get a full asterisks cardThe four asterisks is a marker to say that's the end of my program, but there's still another section of my stuff to comeAfter four asterisks you give the reserved word DATA and this is such a simple programI think from what I can make out it takes these three integers here anduses them to generate yet more datawhich will be of use in some other programs, so that is it. There's the datathat's the end of the pack. If you had a program that generated more data for input to another program afavorite thing you could do was to specify in your job control at the very top that what you would like isnot just a line printer output of your answers, but to punch out another deck of cardsFor use in putting it into some other program later on-So that basically provides you with a set of data to use with a different [program]Yes, and you might say well, why not just pocket in a disk fileYou've got to remember. This is the early seventies. You did not have a personalallocation of files on diskYes, then would be a disk backing up this computerBut use entirely by the operating systemFull of temporary files holding your jobs for you, feeding them in an order and all that, but in the very early daysYou in person did not get a personal account to hold your filesYou wanted to run something later on then you had to print it outSo whereas nowadays a lot of you knowif you want to punch out date for use another program you can either use a Unix pipe and pipe itdirectly into another program or you can use the Unix greater than symbol and send it into a fileMuch more complicated in these days you had to announce ahead of time that you would be punching outresults as well as printing them outThat's interesting. What would a computer do with a hanging Chad?The admission of Richard Stallman's name was not intentionalI was thinking of him actually as I spokeI was tempted for a while and many of my friends told me to try this on with youBut maybe notIt would tend that the compressed airis a lot of compressed air used in these machines to move the cars through very quickly",

   "transcription": "I think I'm on fairly strong ground when I say that we haven't yet, in Computerphile, done recursion.This can get extremely hard.It is difficult to get your head around recursion, sometimes.In one way you can take a very mathematical view about itand close your eyes,and if you're a pure mathematicianwho thinks, as we computer scientists would say,exclusively \"top down\" about things,you can say, \"Oh, it's just a formal definition, you know.\"Here's an example of something you can do recursively.Factorial of n is equal to n times factorial of n minus 1.And if you're used to mathematical thinking, well, that's absolutely alright.Of course, they will then go on, thank heavens, and say:\"Ah, but you've got to stop that.  You're just going round and round\"\"chasing your own tail.\"\"Because, what about factorial n minus 1, then?\"Well, factorial n-1is the same asn minus 1 times factorial n minus 2.And the mathematician will say,Oh yes, all you're doing is re-labeling the n.Because, you know, what was n now becomes n-1, and so on.And yes, that's quite right.But certainly at the bottom of all this, you've got to have a way ofdropping out and terminating thisendless successionof things defined in terms of themselves.Your way out of all thisis that when you hit factorial 1,that is defined to be 1.So let's take, um, an actual real example of thisand one which we will later developwith a program.What we're saying -- I'll abbreviate it nowas \"fact\" rather than \"factorial\".Factorial 4from this definitionis4 times whatever factorial of[quietly] 4 minus 1?3 is.But factorial 3is [laughing] 3 timeswhatever factorial 2 is.Factorial 2 is2 times whatever factorial 1 is.Ah!  But factorial 1 is 1.So there we are, then.Factorial 4 is4 times 3 times 2 times 1isis24.Factorial, if you wanted to work 'em outon a computer --You can do it one of two ways.You can do it recursively --and this really, as we will see, in its implementation, will need a stack;oh yes, it will.Or, you can do it iteratively.What does it mean to do it recursively?I will look at it very briefly here,but then I will do this for you on the stack.So, here's our recursive definition of factorial.In fact, I've put in a comment here, saying\"This is the recursive version.\"What I'm saying here is --there again, those of you familiar withany of the C-like languages,any of the C-like languages,you know, Java, C++, whatever --you'll find this very familiar.The incoming parameter,or \"argument\" as it's sometimes called,is labeled \"n\".The name of the function is \"factorial\".And the answer delivered back by factorialwill be an integer answer.So, every time you call it,it expects an incoming parameter,or argument, as it's sometimes called;and it will deliver you back an answerthat's also another integer.Factorial is only defined for integers,not for real numbers,not for any other sort of thing.Only for integers, and only for positive integers.It won't even work for negative ones.Okay.Now, this is almost like writing mathematics.It's almost like writingthis definition I had up here, look.You say,If the incoming argument is 1,then my answer is 1.The factorial of 1 is 1.So I return, to the outside world that wants to know --I return the answer 1.Factorial 1 is 1.Otherwise, I return back to the outside worldthat wants to know --I say, The factorial of anything elseis n times the factorial of the number 1 less than it.What the secret is here,is the factorial of the next number below,you feed in as the so-called \"actual parameter\";the thing that is 1 less than the n you've got at the moment.So, if we can move 4,I return back 4 times factorial 3.What's n-1?If n is 4, it's factorial 3.Ah!Oh, gosh!What this means is,I can't return the answeruntil I've worked out what factorial 3 is.So I dive back into this same piece of code,only this time --it's still calling it \"n\",but n has now changed into 3.So the first thing you have to get happy aboutis there isn't just one n.There's lots of them.They're all called \"n\", but they're all different;and they all have to be managed and kept separate.That's the first thing:  There is not just one n.Recursion wouldn't work if there were.And that way of keeping them separatejust naturally falls out,no process for guessing,it's a stack.You need a stack to do this properly.Here's my main program.Here's its environment; here's its data.What I'm going to do from here, the main program,is to say,I want factorial 4.In order for it to work correctlyand have its own local variables,which of course includesall of these differentinstances of n, in this case,you put on what's called another stack frame,another whole area of the stack.And you say,That oneis going to deliver backthe answer to factorial 4.But factorial 4 then says,Can't work the answer outuntil I know what factorial 3 is.So, remember,this smaller white oneis gonna work out factorial 3.It alsodoes the usual trick,Oh, I don't know what factorial 3 is.It's 3 times factorial 2.So I've got to know what factorial 2 is.So here is the frameon the stackthat will work out factorial 2.Finally, with a great sense of relief,factorial 2 says,All I know is thatI'm 2 times factorial 1.There's factorial 1.At last.Factorial 1 says,I know what I am;I am the answer 1.The factorial 2 frameis waiting thereon what you might calla \"pending multiply\".It's saying,I am 2 times whatever factorial 1 is.Factorial 1 says, Here you go,into the pending multiply,the answer's 1.And then the same thing happens.Oh!  So the answer to factorial 2, is 2.Where does that need to be delivered back to?It needs to be delivered back into the frame below,which is positively gaspingbecause it wants to do3 times whatever factorial 2 is.It's 3 times 2.Now, where is it that's waiting for that?3 times 2 is 6.So, somewhere down hereis a pending multiply in this frame,saying that factorial 4is 4 times whatever factorial 3 was.But we've just found out thatfactorial 3 ends up cascading down, delivering 6.4 times 6 is 24.Final pending multiply was done,and it gets delivered backinto the main programand in the main program that I've got here --we'll put this out, of course, with a web link to it --all I do with the value when I get it back,is, I just print it out, or sayThe answer to factorial 4 is 24.That's back in the main program's areaat the bottom of the stack.What you have to remember is that,in these pending multiplies that we had,each one of them is holding ontoa different value of nas the left-hand operandin its pending mulitply.This is saying, 4 times something;the one above it said, 3 times something;2 times something; and so on.And the answers cascaded back downand dropped out at the bottom correctly.We'd like to thank Audible.com for sponsoring this computerphile video.They've got loads of books online.So, if you want to check one out,go over toaudible.com/computerphileand you can download one for freeif you sign up there.Today, I'd like to recommendConsole Warsbrand new book out by Blake Harrisand it chroniclesthe console wars of the '90sbetween Nintendo and Segawhen Sega did something really radical to take onthe massive company that was, or corporation that was, Nintendo.Just shows how the players change as time goes on.It's a really, really interesting story.Uh, so check that out.Remember, audible dot com slash computerphileSign up there to try out a free book.Thanks once again to themfor supporting this videoand other computerphile videos.And right up at the very top,the top of stack is often calledthe stack top pointer; SP for short.It's not an IBM one; it's developed by a company called Motorola.",

   "title": "How Secure Shell Works (SSH) - Computerphile",
   "publishedAt": "31 Jan 2019",
   "transcription": "So we did a video a while back on the SCP exploit in the secure copy, and I though it would be just asort of interesting to talk/have a look in a bit more detail about how SSH works.SSH stands for 'Secure Shell' and it first appeared in the mid 90's as a sort of replacement for/way of connecting to a remote machine over the internet.Up until that time the technologies you had to connect to a remote machine, Telnet, rlogin, RSH and so on, worked finebut they transmitted all the data in the clear over the network.  So if you logged into a remote machineanyone with a packet sniffer between you and the remote machine could see everything you were doing on there.When these protocols first appeared that wasn't a problem because the machines were probably only networked within their computer department of a universityor a company so the people that had access to do that were people who worked there and probably the system administrators who had access to these things.Anyway, but as the machines got networked to other networks and you started to build the internet, if you had access to the networkAny network that the data was travelling over you could sniff the packets.And see any of the data that was being transmitted, including passwords and things.And so in 1995, Tatu Ylonen in Finland (I apologies if I pronounced that wrongly) was concerned about thisso he developed a protocol SSH 'Secure Shell' to sort of encrypt the data so that you couldn't sort of see how/what was being sent over the wireYou could see that data was being transmitted across, you could see how much dataYou could see the frequency of it to a certain extent, but you couldn't see what the data was, so you could docertain types of analysis to see whats happening, but you couldn't see the actual data.And so SSH was developed as a way of encrypting the connection between two machinesbut it actually does a lot more than that, because when you SSH to another machineThe first thing that happens is that you open up a TCP connection between those two machineslike any standard things.Although it doesn't have to be a TCP connection.  You can actually specify that SSH uses any sort of reliablenetwork connection to make that, so you could theoretically run it over an RS-232 connection.You could run it over the top of web sockets and things like that.And I know people who have done that sort of thing.So you've got a reliable transport between the two machines and so SSH is sending data over there.And what SSH does is it breaks the data down into a series of packets.And just like any packet transfer, these things have a few fields at the beginning.So at the top you have something that tells you how big the packet is, so you have the packetlength, there are 4 bytes saying the packet is 'this big'.  After that, you have another  byte, which tells youhow much padding you've got.  So you've got the packet length.  You've got how much padding there isand then you've got the data you want - the payload.Then you have the padding that follows that, and so what you do, with each packet after the payloadthe data that you want to send that's part of the connection, you add a small amount of padding.Just random bytes.  They don't mean anything, but they sort of force the encryption to sort of makeit harder to detect what's going on because you've got random data in there.[See some of Mike's videos, for more details on why you might want to do that]And then, you have some sort of message authentication code there, so thatyou know that the data here hasn't been 'monkied' around withand it's actually what has been sent.You can the apply compression if you want to - to the payloadso you can compress the payload using standard compression algorithms, such as zlib, or something to compress the data.And then, the whole of that packet (excluding the length) is then encrypted.The algorithms used for the encryption and for the message authentication codeare selected by the server and the client. They establish that at the beginning, which ones they offerwhich ones they want to use and things, so they are established by the client and the server, so vary from connection to connection.And you can offer many and you can choose the one that is perhaps best for that connection.We'll ignore that for the purposes of this video.So we leave the packet length unencrypted, because obviously we need to know how much data is coming.We encrypt the padding length.  We encrypt the payload. We encrypt the paddingand we send the packet out over the network.  At the other end, that's decrypted by the server, and it then knows it's got the packet of data.And it can piece it back together.And then the same thing is done for this packet, and this packet, and every packet.And the encryption is done, so that it's continuous.You start encrypting this one with the vectors from this one, and so on, so it sort of encrypts it one after the other.At the server, or the client, which receives this you just reverse that process, so you decrypt the packetsyou decompress the payload, and you can extract the data and sort of stitch it back together.So you start off, you've got your TCP connection and that's unencrypted, and on top of that you've got thesepackets, which have been encrypted by the SSH protocol flowing on top of that.But that's not the end of the story.  That's just encrypting the packets.It's/that's not the connection that say if you're SSH and that's not you connection to the remote machine.On top of that, you then open a series of channels that you send the data over.And the reason for that is it enables you to multiplex multiple connections over that thingso when I start a connection to my machine, it's creating a channel on top of this.So if this is one computer over here, and this is another one over here, we're creating this channel here forour shell connection where we can communicate and control things.But this is actually being actually being represented by a connection through the SSH packets.And we could have multiple ones of these between the same machines.  Or we could have different typesof connections, so for example SSH also allows you to forward any sort of TCP connection over thereso you can connect to a remote service via the SSH tunnel, so you can tunnel that throughand its encrypted and then sent out at the other end.  And if we make the connection withverbose mode on, we can actually see it's setting up that connection.  So what we've got here, it's reading theconfiguration data, its local protocol string is.So it connects to the remote machine. It sends back saying I support this version of SSH.I've sent what my version is.  We've then exchanged information about our compatibilitywhat method it is we are going to use for encrypting the messages - the packets over the network. And so on.We've checked that we know the machine, and then we get down to here, we're now trying to authenticateso it's now establishing, ok this is this user on that machine so I can put my password in.And we're now connected, but if we look here 'Authentication succeeded'we are authenticated to the remote machine and you see here it has created a new channel.So it's creating a connection, which again is just going to be 'I send bytes down here' they appear at the other end.You send bytes the other way, they come back to us over this channel.And it's then setting up what type of connection it is.  It's setting environment variables and things.And this is done by sending packets of data wrapped up inside the SSH packets which establish that.Once that's done, we can then communicate and have our interactive session.So SSH is not just a sort of way of connecting your shell.  It's actually got layers of things on top of thatwhich enable you to do lots of interesting things.So you can have multiple connections made over this thing.You don't just have to have one and there are ways you can set SSH up, so that actually, you makethe connection, and it stays connected. When you've finished, so if you make then make anotherconnection to the same server, it reuses that existing connection and multiplexes the two connections in between things.It can start and stop forwarded TCP connections to other addresses, in both directionswhile the connection is running, just by sending different things over this connection.The reason why it's got all this functionality is that often(particularly in the Unix environment, or the Linux environment) when you are connecting to to othermachines, you may just want a remote shell connection, where you just want to type commands and thingsthat's great. But also, the way the Unix X windows graphical user interface worksis that has a/normally done over a connection usually TCP/IP to port 6000, although it can be done over other things as welland that could then be forwarded as another connection, so that you could login to another machine and sendthe graphics commands back encrypted as well.Occasionally you may want to connect to a service behind a firewall, and you can do that by tunnelling thattunnelling it through the SSH connection. So there's lots of reasons why it was built this way.But it's a nice feature, and I know I've been using this now for 20 odd years, 24 years probably now.But actually you're still discovering new things you can do with it. For examplethat you can keep a connection alive beyond when you've just disconnected from the shellso they can reuse that TCP connection. The lower level bits, when you create a new connection on top.",

of thestrangest theorems in modern mathematicsis the Banach tarski paradox it provesthat there is in fact a way to take anobject and separate it into fivedifferent pieces[Music]and then with those five pieces simplyrearrange them no stretching requiredinto two exact copies of the originalitem same density same size sameeverything seriously to dive into themind blow that it is and the way itfundamentally questions math andourselves we have to start by asking afew questions first what is infinity anumberI mean it's nowhere on the number linebut we often say things like there's aninfinite number of blah blah blah and asfar as we know infinity could be realthe universe may be infinite in size andflat extending out forever and everwithout in beyond even the part we canobserve or ever hope to observe that'sexactly what infinity is not a numberper se but rather a size the size ofsomething that doesn't end infinity isnot the biggest number instead it is howmany numbers there are but there aredifferent sizes of infinity the smallesttype of infinity is countable infinitythe number of hours in forever it's alsothe number of whole numbers that thereare natural numbers the numbers we usewhen counting things like 1 2 3 4 5 6and so on sets like these are unendingbut they are countable countable meansthat you can count them from one elementto any other in a finite amount of timeeven if that finite amount of time islonger than you will live or theuniverse will exist for it's stillfinite uncountable infinity on the otherhand is literally bigger too big to evencount the number of real numbers thatthere are not just whole numbers but allnumbersis uncountably infinite you literallycannot count even from 0 to 1 in afinite amount of time by naming everyreal number in between I mean where doyou even start zero okay but what comesnextzero point zero zero zero zero zero zeroeventually we would imagine a one goingsomewhere at the end but there is no endwe could always add another zerouncountability makes this set so muchlarger than the set of all whole numbersthat even between zero and one there aremore numbers than there are wholenumbers on the entire endless numberlinedereck and tours famous diagonalargument helps illustrate this imaginelisting every number between 0 and 1since they are uncountable and can't belisted in order let's imagine randomlygenerating them forever with no repeatseach number we generate can be pairedwith a whole number if there's aone-to-one correspondence between thetwo that is if we can match one wholenumber to each real number on our listthat would mean that countable anduncountable sets are the same size butwe can't do that even though this listgoes on forever forever isn't enoughwatch this if we go diagonally down ourendless list of real numbers and takethe first decimal of the first numberand the second of the second number thethird of the third and so on and add oneto each subtracting one if it happens tobe a nine we can generate a new realnumber that is obviously between 0 & 1but since we've defined it to bedifferent from every number on ourendless list and at least one place it'sclearly not contained in the list inother words we've used up every singlewhole number the entire infinity of themand yet we can stillwith more real numbers here's somethingelse that is true but counterintuitivethere are the same number of evennumbers as there are even and oddnumbers at first that sounds ridiculousclearly there are only half as many evennumbers as all whole numbers but thatintuition is wrong the set of all wholenumbers is denser but every even numbercan be matched with a whole number youwill never run out of members of eitherset so this one-to-one correspondenceshows that both sets are the same sizein other words infinity divided by twois still infinity infinity plus 1 isalso infinity a good illustration ofthis is Hilbert's paradox of the GrandHotel imagine a hotel with a countablyinfinite number of rooms but now imaginethat there is a person booked into everysingle room seemingly it's fully bookedrightNo infinite sets go against common senseyou see if a new guest shows up in oncea room all the hotel has to do is movethe guest in room number one to roomnumber two and the guest in room two toroom 3 and 3 to 4 and 4 to 5 and so onbecause the number of rooms isnever-ending we cannot run out of roomsinfinity minus 1 is also infinity againif one guest leaves the hotel we canshift every guest to the other way guest2 goes to room 1 3 2 2 4 2 3 and so onbecause we have an infinite amount ofguests that is a never-ending supply ofthem no room will be left empty as itturns out you can subtract any finitenumber from infinity and still be leftwith infinity it doesn't care itsunending bonnet tarski hasn't left oursights yet all of this is related we arenow ready to move on to shapes Hilbert'shotel can be applied to a circle pointsaround the circumference can be thoughtof as guests if we remove one point fromthe circle that point is gone rightinfinity tells us it doesn't matter thecircumference of a circle is irrationalit's the radius times 2 pi so if we markoff points beginning from the hole everyradius length along the circumferencegoing clockwise we will never land onthe same point twice ever we can countoff each point we mark with a wholenumber so this set is never endingbut countable just like guests in roomsin Hilbert's hotel and like those guestseven though one has checked out we canjust shift the rest move themcounterclockwise and every room will befilled point one moves to fill in thehole point two fills in the place wherepoint one used to be three fills in twoand so onsince we have an unending supply ofnumbered points no hole will be leftunfilled the missing point is forgottenwe apparently never needed it to becompletethere's one last Mito consequence ofinfinity we should discuss beforetackling Banach tarskiIan Stewart famously proposed abrilliant dictionary one that he calledthe hyper Webster the hyper Websterlists every single possible word of anylength formed from the 26 letters in theEnglish alphabetit begins with a t' followed by a a thena a a then a a a a and after an infinitenumber of those a B then a B a then abaa a baaa and so on until Z za za a etcetc

the avolume by removing the initial a thepublisher is left with every a word sansthe first aid which has surprisinglybecome every possible word just one ofthe 26 volumes has been decomposed intothe entire thing it is now that we'reready to investigate this video'stitular paradox what if we turned anobject a 3dthing into a hyper Webster could wedecompose pieces of it into the wholething yes the first thing we need to dois give every single point on thesurface of the sphere one name and onename only a good way to do this is toname them after how they can be reachedby a given starting point if we movethis starting point across the surfaceof the sphere in steps that are just theright length no matter how many times orin what direction we rotate so long aswe never backtrack it will never wind upin the same place twice we only need torotate in four directions to achievethis paradox up down left and rightaround two perpendicular axes we aregoing to need every single possiblesequence that can be made of any finitelength out of just these four rotationsthat means we will need left right upand down as well as left left left upleft down but of course notleft right because well that'sbacktracking going left and then rightmeans you're the same as you were beforeyou did anything so no left rights noright left's and no up-downs and no downups also notice that I'm writing therotations in order right to left so thefinal rotation is the leftmost letterthat will be important later on anyway alist of all possible sequences ofallowed rotations that are finite inlength is well huge countably infinitein fact but if we apply each one of themto a starting point in green here andthen name the point we land on after thesequence that brought us there we canname a countably infinite set of pointson the surface let's look at how saythese four strings on our list wouldwork right up left ok rotating thestarting point this way takes us herelet's color code the point based on thefinal rotation in its string in thiscase its left and for that we will usepurple next up down down that sequencetakes ushere we name the point didi and color itblue since we ended with a down rotationRDR that will be this points name takesus here and for a final right rotationlet's use red finally for a sequencethat ends with up let's color code thepoint Orange now if we imaginecompleting this process for every singlesequence we will have a countablyinfinite number of points named andcolor coded that's great but not enoughthere are an uncountably infinite numberof points on a spheres surface but noworries we can just pick a point wemissed any point and color it greenmaking it a new starting point and thenrun every sequence from here after doingthis to an uncountably infinite numberof starting points we will have indeednamed and colored every single point onthe surface just once with the exceptionof poles every sequence has two poles ofrotation locations on the sphere thatcome back to exactly where they startedfor any sequence of right or leftrotations the poles are the north andsouth poles the problem with poles likethese is that more than one sequence canlead us to them they can be named morethan once and be colored in more thanone color for example if you follow someother sequence to the north or southpole any subsequent rights or left'swill be equally valid names in order todeal with this we're going to just countthem out of the normal scheme andcolored them all at yellow everysequence has two so there are acountably infinite amount of them nowwith every point on the sphere givenjust one name and just one of six colorswe are ready to take the entire sphereapart every point on the surfacecorresponds to a unique line of pointsbelow it all the way to the center pointand we will be dragging every pointsline along with itCenterpoint we will set aside okay firstwe cut out and extract all the yellowpoems the green starting points theorange up points the blue down pointsand the red and purple left and rightpoints that's the entire sphere withjust these pieces you could build thewhole thing but take a look at the leftpiece it is defined by being a piececomposed of every point accessed via asequence ending with a left rotation ifwe rotate this piece right that's thesame as adding an R to every points namebut left and then right is a backtrackthey cancel each other outand look what happens when we reducethem awaythe set becomes the same as a set of allpoints with names that end with L butalso you D and every point reached withno rotation that's the full set ofstarting points we have turned less thana quarter of the sphere into nearlythree-quarters just by rotating it weadded nothing it's like the hyperWebster if we add the right piece andthe poles of rotation in the centerpoint well we've got the entire sphereagain but with stuff left over to make asecond copy let's rotate the up piecedown the down ups cancel because wellit's the same as going nowhere and we'releft with a set of all starting pointsthe entire up piece the right piece andthe left piece but there's a problemhere we don't need this extra set ofstarting points we still haven't usedthe original ones no worrieslet's just start over we can just moveeverything from the up piece that turnsinto a starting point when rotated downthat means every point whose finalrotation is up let's put them in thedown piece of course after rotatingpoints named you you will just turn intopointsyou and that would give us a copy hereand here so as it turns out we need tomove all points with any name that isjust a string of use we will put them inthe down piece and rotate the up piecedown which makes it congruent to the upright and left pieces add in the downpiece along with sum up and the startingpoint piece and well we're almost donethe poles of rotation and Center aremissing from this copy but no worriesthere's a countably infinite number ofholes where the poles of rotation usedto be which means there is some polearound which we can rotate this spheresuch that every pole hole orbits aroundwithout hitting another well this isjust a bunch of circles with one pointmissing we fill them each like we didearlier and we do the same for thecenter point imagine a circle thatcontains it inside the sphere and justfill in from infinity and look whatwe've done we have taken one sphere andturned it into two identical sphereswithout adding anything one plus oneequals one that took a while to gothrough but the implications are hugeand mathematicians scientists andphilosophers are still debating themcould such a process happen in the realworld I mean it can happenmathematically and math allows us toabstractly predict and describe a lot ofthings in the real world with amazingaccuracy but does the Banach tarskiparadox take it too far is it a placewhere math and physics separate we stilldon't know history is full of examplesof mathematical concepts developed inthe abstract that we did not think wouldever apply to the real world for yearsdecades centuries until eventuallyscience caught up and realized they weretotally applicable and useful the Banachtarski paradox could actually happen inour real world the only catch of courseis that the five pieces you cut yourobject into aren't simplethey must be infinitely complex anddetailed that's not possible to do inthe real world where measurements canonly get so small and there's only afinite amount of time to do anything butmath says it's theoretically valid andsome scientists think it may bephysically valid too there have been anumber of papers published suggesting alink between Banach tarskiand the way tiny tiny subatomicparticles can collide at high energiesand turn into more particles than webegan with we are finite creatures ourlives are small and can onlyscientifically consider a small part ofreality what's common for us is just asliver of what's available we can onlysee so much of the electromagneticspectrum we can only delve so deep intoextensions of space common sense appliesto that which we can access but commonsense is just that commonif total sense is what we want we shouldbe prepared to accept that we shouldn'tcall infinity weird or strange theresults we've arrived at by accepting itare valid true within the system we useto

   "title": "What If Everyone JUMPED At Once?",
   "publishedAt": "19 Aug 2012",
   "transcription": "Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And what if everysingle person on Earth jumped at the exactsame time? Could it cause an earthquake orwould we not even be able to tell?Well, first things first,let's talk about the Earth's rotation.The Earth spins, that's why we have nightand day, and it spins quickly. At the equator,the Earth is spinning at more than 1,000 MPH.Now, a spinning ice skater can speed up bymoving mass closer to the center and theEarth is no different. In fact, if you getdown on the ground right now and move yourmass closer to Earth's center, technically,you will speed up Earth's rotation, makingthis day shorter.Now, the change that you would make to theEarth's rotation is way smaller than we couldeven measure, but it is calculable, and theimpact can be quite impressive when you talkabout redistributing more mass than just one person.For instance, last year, the earthquake inJapan redistributed so much of Earth's masstowards the center, that every day since thenhas been 1.8 microseconds shorter.But that was a giant geological event. Whatcan us humans do to the Earth all on our own?I mean, there are more than 7 billion of usnow. What if we all got together in one placeand jumped?Well, what would that even look like?Interestingly, if you took the entire humanpopulation of Earth and had them all livein one place with the same density that peoplelive in in New York City, you could fit everyone -all of us - into the state of Texas.But that's living, not standing around ina crowd, which is how we would probably wantto do the jump.If every single person alive right now onEarth stood shoulder to shoulder, you couldfit all of us into the city of Los Angeles.It would be an incredible sight to behold -a mere 500 square miles containingevery single person on Earth.Ok, so, then we jump. What happens?Unfortunately, not much. I mean, we're allawesome people here on Earth, but our collectivemass compared to the mass of the entire Earth?It's like nothing.In fact, Dot Physics calculated that if allof us were to get together in one locationand all jump 30 cm into the air at the exactsame time, we would push Earth away from usa tiny amount.Earth would only move away from us about 1/100thof the width of a single Hydrogen Atom. Andhere's another thing. Because we're all jumpingand then going back to where we started, Earthis just going to move back to where it started.So, our big jump won't be able to change Earth'sposition in space, but, c'mon, 7 billion peopleall jumping together? That's gotta be ableto cause some sort of seismic activity, right?So let's say you have a lot of people alltogether in one place and you have them alljump on: 1-2-3!Did you feel that? Well, the BBC did thiswith 50,000 people and discovered that akilometer and a half away, it only registereda .6 on the Richter scale. You would need7 million times more people than even liveon Earth right now to jump at once to recreatethe earthquake that recently happened in Japan.So, even though we're all awesome, comparedto the size of the Earth, we're not much.But don't get too discouraged. Our collectivejump would contain a lot of energy. The StraightDope calculated that even if only the peoplewho lived in China got together and jumped,their jump would be the equivalent of 500tons of TNT. Of course, 500 tons of TNT doesn'tdo much to an Earth that weighs6 sextillion 588 quintillion tons.To make yourself feel more powerful, picka card. I've got 10 of them here, let's say,hmmm, you choose this one. Boom, congratulations,we have just decimated this deck of cards.Why? Well because, technically, decimate doesnot mean \"obliterate completely.\"Deci=10. It means to take away 1/10th of something.So, the next time you take a quiz and don'tdo so well on it, you only get 10%. Well, sure,that's an \"F\", but by getting 10% of themright, you DECIMATED that quiz.And since we've been talking about crowds,let's talk about YouTube crowds. YouTube audiences,that view count that you see at the bottomof every video, and get some perspective onit.We'll being with Dunbar's Number.It's an estimation of the maximum number ofpeople we can have stable, social relationshipswith at a given momentand it's based on the size of our neo-cortex.These aren't just acquaintances, these arepeople you have social contact with - a networkwhere you know how everyone relates to everyoneelse. And the number is usually given to besomewhere between 100-230, which means that whena YouTube video receives more than 230 viewsfrom different people, more people have seenthat video than you could ever realisticallyhope to know well, at a given moment.If a video has more than 100,000 views fromdifferent people, more people have seen thatvideo than you will ever meet in your life.And by meet, I mean shakes hands with, learntheir name, talk with them for a bit.I mean, think of it this way. You and me,we're only statistically expected to livearound 28,470 days. So, even if you were to meetsomeone, 2-3 people every day of your life,including when you were a baby, you stillwouldn't meet as many people as have seenthat YouTube video with 100,000 views.But keep this in mind. Even though you, oreven a large group of us, can't do much tochange Earth's location or rotation, we canaffect it a little bit. Newton's Third Lawguarantees this. If you weigh 150 pounds,the Earth is pulling you down with a forceof 150 pounds. But you are also pulling upon the Earth with a force of 150 pounds.If you fall 3 meters, the Earth has pulledyou down 3 meters. But you have also exerteda equal and opposite force on the Earth.Of course, it's a lot bigger. So, if you fall3 meters, you pull the Earth up about a billionthof the width of a proton, which ain't bad.So the next time you move your body, the nexttime you jump, Felicia, think about this.You just affected the Earth as much as itaffected you. You've got that kind of power.Speaking of power, you all should go checkout \"Geek & Sundry\", Felicia's new channel.It's one of my new favorite things.And as always,thanks for watching.",

   "title": "Travel INSIDE a Black Hole",
   "publishedAt": "07 Mar 2012",
   "transcription": "Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And today we aregoing to go inside a black hole. It's notgoing to be comfortable, but it will be prettyfun. Now, first thing's first: mathematicallyspeaking, anything could become a black hole,if you were to compress it into a small enoughspace. That's right, you, me, this camera -everything in the unvierse has what is knownas a \"Schwarzschild radius.\" A tiny, tiny amountof space that, were you to collapse the entiremass of the object into, its density wouldbe so great that its gravitational pull wouldbe so great that not even light could escapefrom it. You would have a black hole.If you were to compress Mount Everest intosomething smaller than a nanometer, you wouldhave a black hole. And if you were to compressthe entire Earth down to the size of a peanut,you would have a black hole.But, fortunately for us, there is no knownway to compress Everest or Earth in that fashion.But a star, many, many, many times largerthan our own Sun, has a much larger Schwartzchildradius, and when it runs out of fuel and canno longer keep itself hot enough, it collapsesto a single, infinitesimally-small point knownas a \"singularity.\"Its density will be infinite and so itsgravitational pull will be so strong thatnothing can escape, not even light.But enough about ways black holes form, let'sjump into one. First question: what wouldit look like from the outside? Well, we knowthat gravitational fields bend space and time.Stars behind our Sun will actually appearto be in slightly different locations fromEarth, because the Sun's gravitational fieldbends the light coming from those stars.When it comes to the gravitational fieldsof larger objects, like entire galaxies or,for that matter, a black hole, the effectis even nuttier. Light coming from object'sbehind them is significantly distorted,producing smears and smudges.As seen from Earth, the blue galaxy behindthis red galaxy is completely distorted, likea fun house mirror. So, rather than appearingas it really should, it looks to us like a ring -a smudge all the way around the red galaxy.This is known as \"gravitational lensing.\"Now, take a look at this simulation of a blackhole with a galaxy millions of lightyearsbehind it. The galaxy's really not in dangerof the black hole's \"suck,\" but the lightcoming off of that galaxy certainly is. Watchas the galaxy passes behind the black holeand its light is contorted, twisted anddistorted.Now here's a really fun demonstration.What if the Earth were to orbit around a blackhole? Looking from the outside, the Earthwould look normal at first, but as soon asit passed behind the black hole, the blackhole's gravitational field would warp thelight reflecting off the Earth, producingthis.For the sake of simplicity, let's jump intoa simple black hole, one that doesn't havea charge and isn't moving. And, also, isn'talready sucking up a bunch of matter. So it'sjust there on its own.As we approach, the distortion of the skygrows greater and greater. A larger and largerportion of our field of view looking forwardinto the black hole will be filled with darkness.At this point, where half of our field ofview has been swallowed up in darkness, wehave reached the \"Photon Sphere.\"At this point, light is not going to necessarilyget sucked into the black hole, but it doesn'tnecessarily leave it either. Instead, at thismagical point in space, light, photons, canactually orbit the black hole.If you were to stop here for a moment andlook to the side, you could theoreticallysee the back of your own head, because lightreflecting off the back of your head wouldtravel all the way around the sphere of theblack hole, right back to your face.A gravitational field not only warps space,it also warps time. Now, for most intensivepurposes here on Earth, we never have to worryabout that. But near a black hole, gravitywould be so strong that an observer standing,watching you jump into the hole, would seesomething quite strange. They wouldn't seeyou get sucked quickly into the hole. Instead,they would see your approach become slower,and slower, and slower, until you reacheda point known as the event-horizon.This is a point in space where, once crossed,there's no going back. It is at that pointthat light can no longer escape. And, so,to a person watching you fall into the hole,that would be where your journey ended. Youwould seem almost frozen in space, the lightcoming off your body becoming increasinglyred-shifted until you simply faded into nothingness.They would never see you cross the event-horizon.But for you, of course, everything would seemfine and dandy. You would continue passthat horizon to your now, inevitable, death.As you continue to approach the black hole'ssingularity, your view of the entire universewould get compressed into a smaller and smallerpoint in space behind you.If the black hole we're jumping into was largeenough, things actually might be quite comfortableat that event horizon. We'll know that we'renever going to escape and that our lives arepretty much over, but it might take us hoursto actually reach a point where things startedto hurt.Why would they hurt? Well, the closer you getto the singularity, the more significant thedifference in gravitational pull is acrossspace. And, so, parts of me that are closerto the singularity would be pulled more stronglythan parts that were facing away and my entirebody would be stretched toward the singularity.The effect would be so incredible, scientistsdon't usually call it stretching, they callit \"Spaghettification.\"Once you reach this point, you would be dead.Your molecules would be violently ripped andstretched apart, and when they got to thesingularity, well, we don't really know whatwould happen. Perhaps they would completelydisappear in violation of all the laws ofphysics or maybe they would reappear elsewherein the universe. It is believed that a movingor spinning black hole might actually createwhat is known as a \"wormhole,\" a way of transitioningacross space faster than light. Not in anyway that violates the laws of science, butin a way that takes advantage of the universe'sdimensions.For instance, if I wanted to get from thispoint to this point, I'd have to travel thedistance. But, theoretically, a wormhole woulddo something really crazy. For instance, this.Now, the two points are right next to eachother and I can travel between them almostinstantaneously.But, again, this is all theoretical. Luckily,we do have a possible way of analyzing blackholes right here on Earth. Enter the \"Dumbhole.\"Just as a black hole does not permit lightto escape, a Dumbhole is an acoustic blackhole. It won't allow sound to escape. It doesn'thave to be nearly as powerful and scientistshave been able to create Dumbholes in laboratoriesusing special fluids traveling at the speedof sound.A lot of progress still needs to be made inthe world of acoustic black holes, but wemay be able to learn an amazing amount ofinformation about how black holes work bylooking at how sound is treated in a Dumbhole.Now here's another good question: What wouldit look like to travel at the speed of light,say, toward the Sun? Well, surprisingly, youwouldn't just see the Sun immediately rushup toward you. No, no, no. In fact, initially,it would look almost as if the Sun were recedingaway from you. Why? Because your field ofview would vastly increase in size. You wouldbe able to see stuff almost behind you. And here's why.As you sit there, not moving yet, lookingat the Sun, there's light coming from stuffbehind you. But, if you travel the speed oflight, you will actually reach that lightcoming from things behind you. As you reachedlight speed, your field of view would expandlike this, concentrating the stuff in themiddle.But where are you in the universe? Or, here'sa better question. Where is the center ofthe universe? Well, this might sound crazy,but it's everywhere. This is known as the\"Cosmological Principle.\" No matter whereyou are in the universe, everything else willseem to be moving away from you, expanding,at the same rate.The universe is expanding, but not like aballoon getting bigger with all the peopleinside it. Instead, it's as if we are thesurface of a balloon. If you were to put abunch of dots on a balloon and then blow itup, all the dots would move away from eachother at the same rate. And, on the surfaceof the balloon, there is no center.Take a look at these two layers. They areexactly similar, except the top layer representsa 5% expansion of the bottom layer.Let's say that you live on one of these dots,and you want to measure where everything ismoving away from. Well, watch what happenswhen I line up a dot in the past and the present.Boom. It looks like the center of the expansion.I can do this with any dot. As soon as I choosea dot to be the frame of reference, it immediatelybecomes the center of the expansion.So, while dying in a black hole would be lonely,and scary, and morbid, when you look up intothe sky think instead about this. No matterwhere you are, or who you are, or what yourfriends or your parents, you really,scientifically, are the center of the universe.Finally, what if our universe was a googolplexmeters across? It is nowhere near that large.But, if it was, it would be so voluminousthat, statistically, it would be nearly impossiblefor there not to be an exact copy of you somewhereelse out there in the universe. To see why,I highly suggest that you click right thereand check out Brady Haran's new channel \"Numberphile.\"It's part of the YouTube original channel's,and I've worked with these guys before. They'reamazing, they're my favorite kind of geeks.So, check out that video, watch their otherstuff, and if you like math,I highly suggest that you subscribe.And as always,thanks for watching.",

   "transcription": "Imagine being confinedto a 10-by-10-foot roomin complete isolation.No timekeeping devices,no phones, no books,nothing to write on,no windows.Psychologists say that fewerthan three daysin a room like thiscan lead to brain damage.I will be staying in this roomfor three days.Clearly, he is on the borderof misery.Even in a citysurrounded by people,it's possible to feel lonelyor bored.Your brainis like a hungry sponge.It's constantly absorbinginformation.It thrives when stimulated.Between smartphones and books,and movies,and friends and family,thousands of sensationsare constantly goinginto our heads.But what if it allgot cut off?What is boredom?Well, it's believed to bean emotionthat's a less intense formof disgust.A visual representationof emotionsdeveloped by Robert Plutchikshows them all on a wheel.Notice that boredomshares a spokewith disgust and loathing.They are different intensitiesof the same emotion.You see, boredom pushes us awayfrom low-stimulus situationsbecause variety and stimulationliterally leadto neurogenesis \u2013brain-cell growth.We are here todaydoing what we dobecause boredom has guided ustoward greaterand greater challengesand biggerand more complex brains.So what is it liketo be deprivedof the sensationsand social interactionsso many of us take for granted?A landmark study at Harvardand Virginia Universitiesfound that students preferto experience physical painover 15 minutes of boredom.To demonstratethe surprising lengthspeople will go toto avoid boredom,we brought inan unsuspecting subjectfor what he believes to bea focus group.We begin by introducinga set of stimuli,one of whichis very unpleasant.What?Touch it.It did shock me.Did it really?He doesn't like it.Our fake focus testcontinues.So let's startwith the shock button.Jamison, would you chooseto experience this again?I don't wantto do that again.Why wouldn't you?'Cause it shocked me, andI can still feel itgoing down my forearm.Now it's timefor Jamison's true test.The test of boredom.You will be in the roomfor 30 minutes.Please remain in your chair.Feel free to re-experiencethe electric-shock button...- Okay. Okay.- Or not.All right,the moment of truth.When the only two optionsare boredom or painful shock,which willour subject choose?He's not even lookingat the button.It hasn't even beena minute yet,and already Jamisonis restless.With a half hour to goand no other stimulationin the room,the shock buttonis a tempting objectto occupy Jamison's mind.Remember what Jamison saida few minutes ago.I don't wantto do that again.But will he desire stimulation so strongly,he just goes aheadand pushes that button?It took exactly one minuteand 57 seconds of boredomfor Jamison's mind to gofrom, \"Never again,\"to \"Sure, I'll give myselfan electric shockto relieve boredom.\"Sometimes stimulation,any stimulationis perceivedas better than none at all.This guy doesn't likebeing bored.But can he resist touching ita second time?We're social animals.Whether it's another humanor a volleyballor an electric-shock button,you'll make friendswith whatever you need to.Jamison? I'm Michael.Thanks for coming in today.So tell me a little bitabout what you've been up tohere in this room.I've been sittingin this room with a button.Yeah.And despite sayingI didn't want topress it again,I pressed it twice.Why?I was just boredin this room, I suppose, so...Really?- Did that hurt?- YesThe hypothesisis that when left alonewith a very negative stimulus,people will go aheadan re-experience itjust becauseit's something to do.I'm one of them.We dislike being bored so much,sometimes physical painis preferable.But intentionally putting yourselfinto what would seem to bethe most boring environment possiblecan be useful.It's calledsensory deprivation.Psychologistshave conducted experimentson sensory deprivationsince the 1930s.During the Cold War,the military usedsensory deprivationfor both trainingand interrogation.In the 1970s, the activitybecame recreational,with soundproof,lightproof flotation tanksthat keep you buoyantwith salt waterthat is the same temperatureas your body.All right, so I'm on my way toa subterranean float lab.This companysells sensory deprivation.This will besort of a training sessionfor my three days in isolation,and I'm getting guidancefrom an expert.Hey, Dominic.How are you?Hey.What's up, Michael?You know Dominic Monaghanfrom \"Lord of the Rings\"and the TV series \"Lost.\"Now, this isyour first time, right?This is my first time.I'm a little nervous.I've never been alonewithout any stimulation.One of my favourite thingsabout floating is,there's nothing elsegoing on.- Ok.- You can't see anything.You can't hear anything.You can't do anything.You just haveto look at you.And for some people,that's scary. It's like- looking in a mirror for hours.- YeahThis flotation tankis a really good wayof getting him preppedfor the isolation chamber,but I also think he needs to beokay with the fact thatit's gonna put him outsideof his comfort zone.The mind is a good thingto lose every so often.All right,let's take a peek.Oh. So this is the room.This is where I will be floatingfor the next hour,alone with nothing to dobut listen to my thoughts.I'll see you on the other side.The mind is a good thingto lose every so often.You have to remind fear thatyou're in the driver's seat.- Hey!- Dominic!- How was it?- It was really good.- Yeah?- Can we sit down?Yeah, let's do it.My initial thought whenI laid down was,\"Wow, this is buoyant.\"And then I just...started thinking about errands and tasks,but at some point...well, it was like dreams.Uh-huh.But my eyes were open.Like, it was sort of likehalf-dreams you haveeither when you're about to fall asleepor when you're waking up.That's when it getsinteresting.You're allowing your brainto be free.You're just floatingin space.You're just atoms that areon the top of this poolfloating in space.So now you've done this,and you're doingthis isolation booth.Do you think that thatwas in some way helpfulor a hindrance?It made me more...unhappyabout what's coming up.Three days is quite a bitdifferent than one hour.Some people choose isolationto learn about isolation.As we prepareto explore other planets,we're facedwith a little issue.Stuff in outer spaceis really,really far apart.Within our own solar system,even a trip to Marswould take monthsin each direction.That's a long time to spendcut off from the rest of humanitystuck in a tiny spaceship.To get ready for those journeyswe have subjected some peopleto extreme conditionshere on Earth.In 1989, a young Italianinterior designernamed Stefania Follinivolunteeredfor a NASA experimentto help study the effectsof isolationassociated with space travel.She spent 130 days alonein a plexiglass cellin a cave 30 feet undergroundin New Mexico.In the absence of timepiecesand any sign of day or night,Ms Follini's bodywas thrown out of whack.Her menstrual cycle stopped,and her sleep-wake cyclechanged radically.She tended to stay awakefor 20 to 25 hours at a timesleeping about 10 hours.When she finally emerged,she mistakenly believedshe'd only been undergroundabout half as longas she actually had.As difficultas Stefania's experience was,at least she had booksto read.In my isolation chamber,I will only have white wallsto stare at.Alone time \u2013what a pleasure.Checking out,getting away from it all,relaxing...Banishment from society,the silent treatment,solitary confinement.Solitude isn't always nice.What happens when isolationis not voluntary?William Brownhas firsthand knowledgeof solitary confinement.So, William,how much of your lifehave you spent in prison?Probably, like, 16 years.That's, like,almost half your life.Yeah, basically,almost half my life,'cause I went to jailwhen I was 18for armed bank robbery.This right here...This was my home, off and on,about two years.The hole.What was the longest stretchof consecutive time?It was, like,five months total.I'll tell youwhat really amazes me.This feels so much worsethan a jail cell.This doesn't have barsletting in light or a view.Not at all.Would you havea mattress at least?That would be the only thing.In this particular cell, thatwould be the only thing in here.You would just have a mattress, andother than thatyou would have nothing more.This lightwill constantly stay on,so there will be, you know...That light's always on?Even at night?That light is always on.You're left in herewith your thoughts,and that's it.I would sitlike, say, for example,sit in this corner right here.Like, facing the corneror facing out?No, I would face out,and I would just sitand just concentrateon breathing.You don't know.It's like you're in limbo.You never know whenthey're gonna open the door.I've known guys that have servedconsecutive yearsinside this samelittle box.How does that change them?Mentally,it scars them for life.- Really?- Yeah.This is what I'm gonna do.I'm gonna put myself in a roomlike one of these,and I won't have a clock...Anything at all.No way to tell time.What I'm nervous about is,when that door closes......the awareness,the sudden awarenessof how much time I have.See, that's the thingabout it,'cause once this doorright here closes,it's, like, it's final.This is almost a coffin.Really?Even more extreme than isolationfrom other peopleis isolation from other peopleand stimuli.That's what I'm goingto be doinginside this room.This is about as boringas a room can get.It's soundproof, and this lightwill never turn off.I do have a small bed,but there will beno interruptions.I will have no wayto tell what time it is.No meals will be delivered,because all the mealsare inside the room alreadywhite containers of Soylent.I do have plenty of water,and I have a wash basinwith a white bar of soap,and I've got myselfa tiny, little toilet.There's nothing to dobut be completely alonewith myself and my thoughts.Now, psychologists saythat fewer than three daysin a room like thiscan lead to brain damage.I will be staying in this roomfor three daysa full 72 hours.So I'm going to takeyour vitals first.Michael is basically turninghimself into a lab rat.What we want to to is seewhat might change with Michaelbefore and after his timein isolationwhat's gonna happento his blood pressure,what's gonna happen to his pulsehis basic reflexes.Are there actually any medicalconcerns you would have?I'm just gonna bein this room.You got a reallybright light on there.The circadian rhythm,which is your naturalwake and sleep cycleis going to becompletely disruptedby this really bright light.And once yourcircadian rhythm gets off,a lot of other thingsfall apart.Hormone cycles,cognitive ability,metabolic processes.So, you know, it's kind of likeyou're giving yourself jet lag.Oh, great.I think it's important to testhis cognitive abilityto gauge any mental declinethat might happen during his 72 hours of isolation.Let's try the reaction time.Okay, do...This is pretty fun.Can I bring this into the roomwith me?So what's gonna happento my brain in there?Well, one of the issuesthat might worry meis how calm versus neuroticyou might be.Where would you put yourselfon that spectrum?Closer to neurotic. I mean...Yeah.And so I wonderif that might be amplified.That is how my brainwill work.- Right. Of course.- It'll snowball.I'm scared.I'm not gonna be able to dealwith the monotonyand the lackof a sense of time,and I'm gonna havea panic attack.In an extreme situation,people can havemassive hallucinations,be dissociated from reality,have tremendous anxiety,psychotic types of episodes.Marnie, Jake...I'm gonna be gonefor three days.The danger signs to look out forare extreme agitation,where it doesn't appearthat he's aware of his own agitation.That's when I thinkI might intervene.I'm not worriedfor him physically.Like, I think, you know,he's safe in there.But I think that he's gonnastruggle in there.He's gonna be really bored.- I love you.- Love you too.- Bye-bye.- Bye.Oh, my God.Bye.Ah, forgot to ask what time it waswhen I came in.He's always doing something.Reading something, talking to someone.he already looks really bored and he's beenin there 5 seconds.It's just gonna bea horrible 72 hours.I'm actually pretty tired.I've been standinga bunch today.Normally, when I changeinto more comfortable clothesand I'm, like, ready for bedI lay down,and then I pick up my phone,or I pick up a bookor something,but I don't have that.If he succeedsin going to sleepfor any length of timethat's substantial,it's gonna beinteresting to seewhat time he thinks it iswhen he wakes up.Right.I was able to sleep.And I woke upmaybe one or two timesin the night.So I think it's probably,you know, 8:00 a.m.Thursday morning,maybe closer to 9:00 a.m.I guess I should havesome breakfast.One...two...three...I've known Michaelfor three years,and I've never seen himdo a push-up.Six...Z, Y, X, W, V,U, T, S, R, Q,P, O, N, M, L, K...I think he's come upwith some good ideasfor mental stimulation.I wonder if, as time goes by,he's gonna come upwith some more creative ones,or he's gonna startto get less creative.I've done 200 steps now8 more hundreds to go,and I'll be at 1,000.Why is it that so many peopleturn to countingto stay sane when they'rein these isolated environments?Well, our mindswant to remain active.They're naturally active.The healthiest peoplewho survivein these types of environmentswill do somethingto self-stimulate.They'll count. They'll sing.They'll do physical exercise.97, 98, 99, 100.300 steps and then some changethat I just took right there.That's just a little bonusfor my body, for my health.It's amazing how hard it isto tell what time of day it isjust based on your body.I think it's...about 7.00 or 7.30 p.m.on Thursday.I think I'm gonna havedinner now.He's already quite offon his perception of time.I was actually surprisedat how quick that happened.I was, too.You know, if you're usinghunger as your gaugethat's out the window, too,because the shiftsin hormonesare going to changeyour appetite.You know,they look at lab ratswho have had theircircadian rhythm destroyed,and they overeat.12, 13...At the moment, I'm feeling......bored but obviouslynothing dramatic.If I had to guess,it would be...24 hours nowsince I first came in.One day down, two to go.If he getsa full sleep cycle in,he'll wake up not knowingwhere he is.Right.Good morning.I don't knowif I slept for eight hoursor if I slept for three.If you thinkit's bedtime, it is...so long as you go to bed.If you thinkit's breakfast time,it is, if you're havingbreakfast.What am I looking forward to the most?Uh...seeing my family and friends.It's not eventhat I want a meal.It's actually that I just wantto have a meal with people.I just want to talkto some people.I just want some other wordscoming in to methan the ones that comeout of my own mouth.He enjoys sharing thingswith people,and to have no one, just nothingcoming back for three days,might be difficult.I am the only personI'm hanging out with.If you'rein true isolation,literally, part of your brainis generatingsome kind of companionthat you can converse with.I think having you here...makes a big difference.He's entertained himselfin a sense,you know, talkingto the camera,and that's been helpfulfor him.It's really kept himcognitively aware.I just feel like I've reallylost all connection to time,but I'm guessingit's, you know, 8.00 p.m.maybe 9.00 p.m. on Friday.A good timeto get some shut-eyewhen there's notmuch else to do.I think it's Saturday,about 9.00 a.m.Saturday, the day I get out.So his dissociation withthe actual timehas doubled now.Right. He wakes up, and there's this bright light,and he's thinking,\"Oh, it must be morning.\"I've spent a lot of timebeing entertainedby my memories,and I'm thinking of the peopleand the placesand the eventsand how I miss themand how I treasurethose moments.There's a sort of cinemain my brain,a cinema of those memoriesthat's kept mefrom being very bored.So I think...it's 8.00 p.m.on Saturday.So, in about a couple hours,I should see that door open.He's not even close,and I wonder how he's gonnarespond to that.I don't thinkI'm getting out today.A fear I have right nowis that it's just Fridayand that there's stilla lot of time left.There were other timesduring thisthat I was definitely more Zenabout everything.Now I'm upset.I can't believe the colourof the light isn't changing.In the mornings,when I wake up,it's so much more yellow.Without some typeof stimulation,the mind wants to stimulateitself anywayand will beginto hallucinateand beginto play all sorts of tricks.Absolutely.My thoughtsare really incoherent.It's hard for me evento remember what I just thought.712, 713, 714,715, 7...15, 716, 717, 718 ...In a way, our brainsare kind ofa \"use it or lose it\" thing.He's going to havea definite decreasein his cognitive ability,a decrease in his overall sense of well-being.How many bottles of waterhave I drank?Is there one more...laying around herethat I've lost?'Cause there are only six here.But then down herethere are...Did I...All of the dreams I've hadthat I rememberhave been about this room.They've beenabout me being in this roomand about...He wakes up,and then he's in the room,and it's difficult for himto discern the differencebetween realityand dreaming sometimes.So that's a real dissociationfor him.S, R, Q...L, M, N, O, P...I actually feelkind of worried about him now,because when he first wentin there,he was, like, bored like someonewaiting for a bus, you know.Now he looksactually depressed.The soap is really unique.It's not a kind of soapI've ever used before,and I really dislike the smell.And I keep smelling it'cause it's just sitting there.Clearly, Michaelis not happy right now.He looks, like, you knowon the border of misery.Really aggravatedby how uncomfortable I am.This seems like a very,very long three days.I'd feel better if he was talking.He was just laying there.When I walked in,I thought he'd be,you know, sitting on the bed.You know, this was somethinghe wanted to do, but...I expected him to be bored...terribly bored,but I thoughthe'd still be talking and...trying to entertain himself.It seems like Michael woke upfrom some kind of dream.He looks confused.He's not enjoying this. He wants out of there.I don't think he can see us.I'm really confused.Wait.Did...I guess not.I guess I just dreamt it.I didn't think it would affect me like this.I am so confused.I think he just woke up and was having a dream.Is 72 hours over?It's 72 hours, Michael.You can come out.All right, I'm coming out.Hey.- Congratulations.- Thank you.Oh, my gosh,it's bright in there.It's really bright in there.I hadn't really noticedbut now that you mention it.- Congratulations.- Hey.That knock scared me.- Did it startle you?- Yeah.Every little noisehas been startling me.Okay. You seemvery with it right now.It's excited energyby coming out.At first, I thought it wasthat I want to communicate,but, actually,I need this direction, too.Even if it's just nods and stuff,that's so much better.Let me just check your vitalsbefore you see your family.155 over 95,so that's quite a jumpin your blood pressure.Your pulse is also higher.I think that's 'causeyou're excited to be out.I think this is a huge rush.I'm interested to see nowhow you dowith some of the more cognitive tests.3-18-09-72-72?There you go.I would say you did actuallya little bit better this time.Oh, wow. Okay.Although we had hypothesisedyou would be worse at all of these tests,I think the rush of adrenalinethat you gotfrom finally being out and beingto able to communicateactually had you more focused,more aware,and that's why you performed better.I find it interesting thatthe test you did the worst onis probably the most to do with the useof the verbal language,and you've had definitely a lackof that over the last 72 hours.It was just me with myselffor three days.It was only me.Hey. How are you?- I'm good.- Oh, good. I missed you.Let me say hi to my mom.Hi.Oh. Glad you survived that.In the room,I was fine being alone.This is whereI've been living.But then near the end,as I started to anticipatecoming outand being able to talk to peopleand share my experienceI realisedhow important that was.If you only haveyour own experiences,you're not fully having them.You have to have someone elseto listen to themand react to them,and then you'vefully experienced them.Anyway, I've moved.I don't live there anymore.When I was in isolation,I was surprised mostby two things \u2013how easy it was to be separatedfrom distractions,like entertainment and phones,and how difficult it wasto be separatedfrom things we humans evolvedalongside \u2013the Earth and other people.I was amazedby how uncomfortable,confusing, and scary it wasto have nothing but myself.You know, I used to bea really big fan of the saying,\"He who travels fastesttravels alone.\"I think I liked itbecause it made me feel betterabout how I preferredto be independentand to be leftto my own devices.But now I appreciatethe full phrase better.It may be true that he whotravels fastest travels alone,but he who travels furthesttravels with others.And, as always,thanks for watching.This season on \"Mind Field\"...Ready?Hold the drug in your mouthuntil we say \"swallow.\"There have beensome audio/visual distortions.Ow!You may see some imagesbehind your eyes.Ooh.You [BLEEP] dick!Why don't you come in here and[BLEEP] talk to me in person?How does it feelto be knownas the Ken and Barbieof real life?It isn't a breakfastfor champions.It's a breakfast for sheeple.Bachelor number twois an online chatbot.What in the world?Beautiful.Welcome to \"Mind Field.\"",

   "title": "How High Can We Build?",
   "publishedAt": "03 Jun 2012",
   "transcription": "hey Vsauce Michael here and when thePyramids of Giza were built the tallestwas 147 meters tall making them thetallest things humans had ever built andthey remained that way for nearly fourthousand years it wasn't even until the1300s that we finally got around tomaking something taller a Cathedral inEngland so does that mean that the GreatPyramids of Giza are the best talleststructures of all time well find outmore all aboard the boat so what is abuilding well technically a building isa structure in which at least 50% of itsheight comes from floor plates wherepeople can live workchill out it has to be habitable anyless than that and it's not a buildingit's a tower after the lincoln cathedralfinally surpassed the height of thepyramids a number of churches continueto be built that kept breaking andsetting new records the next long termrecord holder was the Eiffel Tower itwas the tallest thing ever in historythat we had built for about 40 years ina row it was finally surpassed by theChrysler Building in New York a personalfavorite which was then quickly bestedby the Empire State Building now theEmpire State Building is interesting inthat it was the first structure everbuilt by a man that was so tall were youto jump off the top of it you wouldactually reach terminal velocity beforehe hit the bottom it was the firststructure we'd ever built that was sotall rather than just continuing toaccelerate as you fell you wouldactually stop accelerating because youwould reach the fastest possible speedyour limp body can fall outin the mid-1950s something weird startedto happen humans started to build radioand TV towers these things could be waytaller than the buildings that we'vemade previously that had to be habitableand so ever since the Empire StateBuilding had its record broken by a TVtower all these other famously tallbuildings the Petronas Towers Taipei 101the World Trade Center the Willis Towerformerly Sears Tower none of them haveever within their existence actuallyheld the title for being the tallestthing we've ever built there was alwaysa radio or TV tower somewhere that weStallard up until quite recently and forquite a whilethe record for the tallest thing everbuilt by humans went to the Warsaw radiomast in Poland it's visually incrediblystriking because there aren't any otherskyscrapers around it it's all alonebeing very tall well that was until 1991where some workers exchanging guy wiresmade a mistake and the whole thingstarted to bend and then snapped in themiddle there's no video of the eventhappening but it would have been similarto this collapse though much much taller[Applause]after the Warsaw radio mast collapsedthe KVLY TV mast in North Dakota becamethe tallest still standing structurebuilt by me but recently buildings havemade a comeback and to check that outwe're gonna have to travel to the MiddleEast this is the first time I've evertouched the Nile[Music]but uh okay so that was me dipping mywaterproof camera into the Nile if youwere to take the entire length of theNile River and stand it up on its edgeperpendicular to the earth it wouldreach into outer space about this farit's pretty impressive but where doesthe Space Shuttle orbit and where doesthe International Space Station orbitthis far away this far away maybe thisfar away actually if this pinkinflatable Horrible Bosses ball was theearth the Space Shuttle would orbitabout right there it's incredible butit's possible because the shuttle andthe International Space Station travelsso quickly they travel so quickly aroundthe Earth that instead of seeing onesunrise and sunset every 24 hoursthey see 16 but don't be jealous you caneasily see more than one sunrise and/orsunset in a day by taking advantage oftall structures so let's take a look atthe tallest structure the currentrecord-holder for the tallest thinghumans have ever built the Burj Khalifain Dubai the height of this buildingblows my mind you can literally watchthe sunset from the base of the buildingand then take a super-fast elevator allthe way up to the top and watch the sameSun set again in fact the difference intiming between sunset at the base andthe top is so significantthe Dubai Islamic Affairs Departmentactually had to make a ruling about windyou can start and break here fast duringRamadan inside the building people abovefloor 80 or higher have to actually waitto start eating 2 to 3 minutes after thepeople at the base because the Sunhasn't yet setfor those at the top but before you headto Dubai to watch the Sun rise or settwice in a day keep in mind that theonly hype you actually need to see twosunrises or sunsets is the height ofyour own body try this the next timeyou're at a beach watch the Sun rise orset over the water water is importantbecause it won't have the terrain andHill issues that land does now let's sayyou're watching a sunset begin by layingon your stomach watch the sunset and assoon as the very last little bit of theSun goes below the horizon quickly popup into a standing position and voilayou'll see the sun's back part of itsback and it will set another time if youtake a stopwatch and record the timebetween the first setting and the secondsetting that you witness and measure theheight of your eyes when you're layingdown and when you're standing you canuse those numbers to calculate theradius of the earth xkcd took this alittle bit further by proposing thedouble sunset date take your date out tothe beach in a cherry picker and sureenough it was calculated given the speedof a cherry picker all you have to do ismove about six feet up and you can watcha beautiful sunset all over againto put things in perspective the BurjKhalifa is nowhere near as tall as MountEverest but the tallest structure thatwe could potentially build wouldn't beas tall as Mount Everest it would be wayway taller like in this face taller ofcourse the problem with building thingsthat are really tall is that they getheavier and heavier and have to supporttheir own weight but only up to a pointif a structure was so tall that it woundup at the altitude of a geostationaryorbit it would start to feel a new forcenot just a gravitational force downwardbut all of a sudden this new centrifugalforce up and outward and so a buildingthat tall could bestable through tension and more than35,000 kilometers high this kind ofstructure is known as a space elevatorunfortunately there aren't any materialsknown to science today that are strongenough to make building something thatlarge feasible with the exception maybeof carbon nanotubes or boron nitridenanotubes of course if we went to asmaller celestial body like the moon wecould build one today out of stuff likeKevlar there are a lot of differentthings that we have to be wary of whenwe build a space elevator for instancehow do we dodge space debris onesolution is to attach the earth side ofthe cable to a boat in the ocean thatcan maneuver around and move theelevator away from dangerous obstaclesanother interesting point is that thetaller the cable the faster the far endof it will be traveling in fact if thecable is more than 50 thousandkilometers long its far end will betraveling near escape velocity andsimply walking outside could take you tothe moon but why build a space elevatorwell because it would be awesome butalso for better reasons - for instanceright now in order to send a pound ofmaterial into orbit it costs abouteleven thousand dollars but with a spaceelevator we could send the same amountof material into orbit for only about ahundred bucks that difference is sosignificant that philip reagan has saidthat the first country to deploy a spaceelevator will have a ninety five percentcost advantage and will possibly be ableto control all space related activitiesalright so here you see in the mirrorAlex playing guitar while she holds thecamera in her mouth and records usimpressive I'm here with Kristin

   "title": "Why Do We Kiss?",
   "publishedAt": "01 May 2013",
   "transcription": "hey Vsauce Michael here attachment oftwo people's lips kissing the averageperson will spend about twenty thousandone hundred and sixteen minutes of hisor her life kissing and the world recordfor the longest continuous kiss is 58hours 35 minutes and 58 seconds but whydo we kiss I mean if you think about itit seems kind of weird rightI mean sure today kissing representspeace respect passion love but when thefirst two people in human history kissedwere they just kind of being gross welllet's begin with what we do knowkissing feels good and it's good for youa passionate kiss burns about two tothree calories per minute and releasesepinephrine and norepinephrine into theblood making your heart to pump fasterkissing more often is correlated with areduction of bad cholesterol andperceived stress but these positiveeffects didn't become widespread byaccidentwhy did brains and bodies that lovekissing become so common well a popularstory holds it that pac-man's shape wasinspired by the shape of a pizza with aslice missing but Toru Iwatani thecreator of pac-man admitted that thiswas only half truePacman's shape was also inspired byrounding out the shape of the Japanesecharacter for mouth and its mouths andpac-man's favorite activity eating whichtogether bring us closer to the heart ofthe kiss evolutionary psychologists haveargued that what we know today askissing may have come from kiss feedingthe exchange of pre-chewed food from onemouth to another mother birds are famousfor doing this and many primates arefrequently seen doing it as well notthat long ago it was common betweenhuman mothers and their children in factbefore commerciallyproduced or DIY baby food instructionswere readily available it made a lot ofsenserecently Alicia Silverstone uploaded aclip of herself mouth feeding her childit seemed strange to some people buteven though yeah it exchanges salivawhich like any contact with an infantcan transfer pathogens healthy mothersand healthy children can benefit fromthe fact that kiss feeding providesnutrients carbohydrates proteins ironand zinc which are not always availablein breast milk plus an adult saliva canhelp pre digest the food making vitaminslike b12 easier for the baby to absorbso mouth to mouth attachment has ahistory of intimacy trust and closenessyour saliva also carries informationabout who you are your level of healthand mucous membranes in our mouths arepermeable to hormones like testosteronemaking a kiss a way to taste tests ofpotential mate a good kiss can bebiological evidence that your kissermight be a good mate so as a strategyfor mate selection prehistoric peoplewho enjoyed kissing and did it moreoften may have made better decisionspicked better mates reproduced moresuccessfully and eventually become thenorm giving us us people who lovekissing any infant could have seen thosebenefits coming from a mile away eventhough an infant's vision isn't thatgreat from birth to four months babiescan only focus on things about eight toten inches away from their face whichnot surprisingly is about the distanceto their mothers face whilebreastfeeding so faces especially thoselooking right at us tend to be the veryfirst things in our lives we can focuson and see clearly this might explainwhy we are so good at detecting faceshumans are off the charts when it comesto this in fact we tend to see facesevenwhen there aren't any it's calledpareidolia because humans are socooperative it makes sense for us to begood at recognizing faces and moreimportantly detecting when someone islooking directly at us and clearlyexpressing when we are looking atsomeone else a predator who lives by notbeing seen needs a gaze that's lessobvious in fact research has shown thatours surprisingly white scleras the areathat borders the iris isn't just anaccident but is a vital piece of humaneye morphology that makes it easier forus to ascertain the direction of someoneelse's gaze at a glance we also haveimpressive gaze direction that worksinside our brains containing individualneurons that fire when someone isstaring directly at us but that stopfiring if the gaze shifts just a degreeor two so yeah you can tell when you arebeing watchedwe humans are quite sensitive to it eventhose of us with scopa phobia the fearof being stared at but to be sure inorder for this to work the otherperson's gaze must be within your lineof sight your field of vision that isyou can see them otherwise if the stareis coming say from behind there is noevidence that people can tell they arebeing watchedthe psychic staring effect falls withinthe realm of pseudoscience no widelyaccepted studies have ever foundevidence that it exists anecdotallywhat's more likely is that the very actof rubbernecking to see who's watchingcauses people to look up and for yourgazes to attach but what aboutattachment when no one is watching oneexplanation for an infant's loveattachment to their mother doesn'tinvolve vision or staring but insteadfood the idea is that we love ourmothers because as soon as we are bornthey are a source of life-sustainingnourishment but what if that nourishmentcame not from a loving mother but from ascary wire mother in the 1950s HarryHarlow conducted a series of famous butcontroversial experiments on monkeys atthe University of wisconsin-madisonHarlow's findings had substantialimplications on our understanding ofattachment but by today's standards hiswork would largely be consideredunethical and one of his most famousexperiments Harlow separated youngmonkeys from their mothers as soon asthey were born and stuck them in cageswith to fake mothers a soft one wrappedin cloth that did nothing and a coldmechanical mother made of wire thatnonetheless did provide food but despitebeing a cupboard mother the young babymonkeys didn't bond with her when Harlowor his team scared the baby monkeys witha strange contraption the monkeys ranand cleaned not - their wire source oflife-sustaining nourishment but to thesoft cuddly and otherwise useless clothmother this suggested that warmth andcomfort was more important than foodwhen it came to nurturing attachmentHarlow also built a rejecting motherwhich used a blast of pressurized air topush baby monkeys away but instead offinding another source of comfort thesemonkeys clung even tighter at all timesthan monkeys raised without rejectingmothers and this is what blows my mindthe instinct for warmth and comfort innewborn creatures is so strong it notonly resists attempts to frustrate itbut is paradoxically strengthened by itEckerd has tested this by using electricshocks to discourage ducklings fromfollowing the object they were imprintedon but it only strengthened the behaviorand made them follow more closely thanever before the fact that a wire motheror a rejecting mother or receivingelectric shocks for attaching to yourmother would cause more attachment morelove more dependence seems like aparadox but paradoxes can teach us asOscar Wilde put it a paradox is thetruth standing on its head to attractattention and what gets our attentionhere is the effect uncertainty can havein 1955 AE Fisher conducted anexperiment on puppies his team separatedpuppies into three groups members of thefirst group were treated kindly everytime they approached a researchermembers of the second group werepunished for approaching the researchersand puppies in the third group wererandomly treated kindly or punished theygrew up never knowing what to expecttheir world was not a world of kindnessor punishment but rather one ofuncertainty what's really chilling isthat the study found that that group thethird group of puppies wound up beingthe most attached to the researchers thethird group loved the researchers thestrongest and was the most dependentupon them guy Mirchi called this thepolarity principle stress including themental stress of uncertainty is aningredient in attachment or love andperhaps even manifestations of hatredit's polar opposite somehow enhance loveuncertainty psychologically can lead tosome of the greatest feelings ofattachmentdependence good things and bad things inour lives often seem random and out ofour control so it's no surprise that weoften react with blind love andacceptance in the face of an unfairexistence because what else are wesupposed to do we are that third groupof puppies but investigating uncertaintyconquering it so as to make the bestdecisions possible is advantageous soover time life has favoured activitiesthat turn uncertainty into knowledge notevery person out there is the best matefor you but if it didn't matter whichone you picked a kiss a taste testwouldn't be necessary and it wouldn'tneed to feel so good or bring us so muchpleasure so go out there and kisssomeone today and as always thanks forwatchingby the way tomorrow I am headed to theEuropean Space Agency's spaceport inSouth America with euronews to watch arocket launch in real life do you haveany questions about space or spacetravel today let me know in the commentsbelow and I will ask the experts yourquestions",

is an illusioncolor as we know it does not existin the outside world beyond us likegravity or protons do instead color iscreated inside our headsour brains convert a certain range ofthe electromagnetic spectruminto color i can measure the wavelengthof radiationbut i can't measure or observethe experience of a color insideyour mind sohow do i know that when you and melook at a strawberry and in my brainthis perception occurs whichi call red that in your brain aperception likethis doesn't occur which you have ofcourse also learned to call redwe both call it red we communicateeffectivelyand walk away never knowing just howdifferent each of our internalexperiencesreally were of course we already knowthat not everybodysees color in exactly the same wayone example would be color blindnessbut we can diagnose and discuss thesedifferences because people with theconditionsfail to see things that most of us canconceivably though there could be waysof seeing that we usethat cause colors to look differently indifferent people's mindswithout altering their performances onany tests we could come up withof course if that were the case wouldn'tsome people think other colors lookedbetter than othersor that some colors were morecomplementary of otherswell yeah but doesn't that alreadyhappenthis matters because it shows howfundamentallyin terms of our perceptions we are allalonein our minds let's say i met analien from a far away solar system wholucky enough could speak english but hadneverand could never feel paini could explain to the alien that painis sent through a delta and c fibers tothe spinal cordthe alien could learn every single celland pathway and process and chemicalinvolved in the feeling of painthe alien could pass a biology examabout painand believe that pain to us generally isa badthing but no matter how much he learnedthe alien would never actually feelpain philosophers call theseineffable raw feelings qualiaand our inability to connect physicalphenomenon to these rawfeelings our inability to explain andshareour own internal qualia is knownas the explanatory gap this gap isconfronted when describingcolor to someone who has been blindtheir entire lifetommy edison has never been able to seehe has a youtube channel where hedescribes what being blindis like it's an amazing channelin one video he talks about colors andhow strange and foreign of a concept itseems to himsighted people try to explain forinstance that redis hot and blue is cold but to someonewho has never seena single color that just seemsweird and as he explains it has nevercaused him to finallysee a color some philosophers likedaniel dennett argue that qualia may beprivate and ineffable simply because ofa failureof our own language not because they arenecessarilyalways going to be impossible to sharethere may be an alien race thatcommunicates in a language that causescolors to appear in your brain withoutyour retinahaving to be involved at all or withoutyou having to have ever needed toactuallysee the color yourself perhaps even inenglish he saysgiven millions and billions of wordsused in just the right wayit may be possible to adequatelydescribe a colorsuch that a blind person could see itfor the first time or you could figureout that once and for allyes or no in fact you and your frienddo not see the same redbut for now it remains the case thatwe have no way of knowing if my redis the same as your red maybe one dayour language will allow us to shareand find out or maybe it never willi know it's frustrating to not have ananswer but the merefact that you guys can ask me about myinternal experiences and the mere factthat i can ask my friendsand we can all collectively wonder atthe concept of qualiais quite incredible and alsoquite human animals can doall sorts of clever things that we dothey can use toolsproblem solve communicate cooperateexhibit curiosityplan for the future and although wecan't know for suremany animals certainly act as if theyfeelemotions loneliness fearjoy apes have even been taught to uselanguage to talk to us humans it's asort ofsign language that they've used to doeverything from answerquestions to express emotion or evenproducenovel thoughts unlike any other animalthese apes are able to understandlanguage and form responsesat about the level of a two and a halfyear old humanchild but there's something that nosigning apehas ever done no ape has everasked a question joseph jordania'swho asked the first question is a greatread on this topic and it's availablefor freeonline for as long as we have been ableto use sign language to communicate withapesthey have never wondered out loud aboutanything thatwe might know that they don'tof course this does not mean that apesand plenty of other animalsaren't curious they obviously arebut what it suggests is that they lack atheory of mind an understanding thatother peoplehave separate minds that they haveknowledge access to information that youmight not have even us humansaren't born with a theory of mind andthere's a famous experiment to test whena human childfirst develops a theory of mind it iscalledthe

thatthing hiding in the shadows is a threator just a shadow it's advantageous toerr on the side of threat organisms witha healthy sense of apophenia live longerlong enough to have kids and raise

appearsdirectly overhead but once every Earthrotation the subsolar point fallssomewhere on your Meridian making itnoon for you the technical name for thisnoon for you is local apparent solarnoon the clock on your wrist and theclock on your phone don't tell you yourlocal apparent solar time because longago we realized that if every meridianhad its own time a person just a fewkilometers away seeing different shadowsthan you did would disagree with you onwhat time it was so town's adopted theirown time now later on this trick wasstandardized and time zones as we knowthem today came about but that's not allwe didn't like about shadow basedsundial time to explore deeper we haveto begin by asking what's a dayI mean obviously it's just the time ittakes the earth to turn around onceright but according to what everythingelse in space is moving in some way tothe universe doesn't include aconvenient sheet of graph paper atAbsolute rest we can trace paths on thebest we can do on that front is to lookat very very far far far away stars sofar away like distant features of thelandscape out the window of a moving carthey barely move as Earth does now tothem a Meridian on earth completes atrip around about once every twentythree point nine hours this is called aside aerial day side aerial meanspertaining to the Stars even though thesidereal day seems pretty clear it's notwhat our calendars and clocks are basedon because there's a nearer star whoseposition relative to us has a biggereffect on our lives the Sun looking downon the north pole at Earth'scounterclockwise spin the earth alsomoves counterclockwise around the Sunafter a sidereal day the earth has moveda bit along its orbit so some morerotation is required for the samemeridian to point back towards the Sunagain this longer definition of onerotation is what the modern calendar andclock is based on it is called the solarday but here's the thing exactly howlong the earth has to rotate to completea solar day changes day to day ourclocks are just based on the averageamount of time this takes so throughoutthe year they fall ahead and behind theSun this is a solar graph a picture ofthe sun's path across the sky everysingle day if our clocks actually toldus local apparent solar time if you tooka picture of the sky every day at noonyou should get a line of Suns but thisis what really happensover the course of a year it will appearas though your clock is running slow andthen fast and then slow again and thenfast again this problem was known sinceat least ancient times even if its causewas it in order to reconcile the two theequation of time was constructed in thissense equation means to reconcile theequation of time was applied to what aclock said in order to compute the realtime the solar time a sundial would shownow some fancy clocks called equationclocks were made that would do this foryou but eventually we gave up we gave upand just said no the real time isn'twhat the Sun says it's what ourinventions say now this transition was abig one it was humanity growing up itwas like the first time you realizeyou're stronger than your parents werealized our timepieces were moreregular and turned our backs on thetimepieces nature had but what causesthis disagreement in the first placeas it turns out the answer revolvesaround revolving the way the Earthrevolves around the Sun if the Equatorfaced the Sun all the time and the earthalways orbited at the same speed thesubsolar point would just stay rightthere on the equator throughout the yearand the amount of extra time spentrotating the earth needed to do tofinish a solar day would always be thesame but those two things aren't thecase first of all the Earth's orbit isslightly elliptical so its speed variesthroughout the year when it's movingaround the Sun faster around thebeginning of January the amount of extraturning time needed to complete thesolar day is longer than when it'sfurther away from the Sun and movingmore slowly there's more because theearth is tilted the subsolar point isdragged throughout the year in a circlearound Earth that's not the equator soit changes directlymoving northeast then leveling out andgoing southeast before leveling out andgoing northeast again during times ofthe year when the subsolar point isbeing dragged by Earth's orbit mostlyeast it gains against Earth's spinfaster more time is required for the dayto finish now by coincidence we arealive at a time when both of thesephenomena lengthen and shorten days atroughly the same time so they add upmaking September 18th almost a minuteshorter than the longest day of the yearDecember 22nd for northern hemisphereIan's December has the shortest periodsof daylight but the whole solar day fromsunrise to sunrise is for everyone onearth the longest of the year onDecember 22nd people in the North justspent most of it in darkness earth'stilt it doesn't just affect how long aday is it also affects how long a yearis this is because the Earth's tilt iswhat causes the seasons for the half ofthe earth tilted towards the Sun thesame amount of solar radiation is spreadacross less space than it is on theother half so there is more heat energylaid down per area this causes what wecall summer and winter for the otherhalf the amount of time from one ofthese seasonal orientations of the earthto its occurrence again is called asolar year or a tropical year it's avery useful way to define a year becauseit contains every single season exactlysince it's based on the veryorientations that caused thembut the problem is this the number ofsolar days that occur in a solar year isnot a whole numberit's almost 365 but after that manysolar days about 1/4 of a day morehappens before the solar year startsagain this makes designing a calendarmore like designing a calendar if yourcalendar only ever has 365 days in ayear over time those dates will driftfrom the seasonal positions they used tooccur during unless hmmthis extra quarter of a turn adds up toa full day after four years see March1st is coming a day too soon now so ifwe just delay March by adding an extraday at the end of February every fouryears a leap day we're back on trackleap days do not add days to your lifeyou're still going to live the samenumber of them they just change what wecall them but really who cares aboutbeing one day earlier every four years Imean one day isn't much you hardlynotice it but over timewell if America's founders had declarednot only independence from Britain butalso from leap days and abolished themfrom happening today 240 years latertheir calendar would be a full twomonths ahead of Earth's position puttingAmerica's coldest winter days in Apriland its hottest summer days in Octoberadding a day every four years is whatthe famous Julian calendar doesintroduced in 46 BC by Julius Caesarit was the defacto standardized Westerncalendar for a very long time more thana millennium but it's not perfectlook closelyleap days actually move the calendarjust slightly too far each time becauseI lied 365 and a quarter solar daysdon't occur within one solar year thereal number is slightly less andfluctuates year-to-year based onlong-term changes to earth and the sun'smovements which means adding one dayevery four years is just a teensy weensytoo many by 1582 julian calendar dateswere ten days behind the seasonscompared to where they used to be that'snot badten days and more than a millennium anda half but the Catholic Church caredbecause they wanted Easter to occurexactly when it used to centuries agoastronomers at the time realized that ifleap days pushed the calendar too farbehind the seasons we would just need tocelebrate fewer of them to fix theproblem specifically we would need threefewer leap days every four centuries therule they wrote to achieve this statedthat every four years would continue tobe a leap year except if it wasdivisible by 100 unless it was alsoevenly divisible by 400 this removesthree every 400 years on October 4thPope Gregory the 13th introduced thisnew calendar it took his name theGregorian calendarhe also undid the drift that hadoccurred since the early days of theJulian and declared on October 4th thattomorrow would be October 15thOctober 5th to the 14th never happenedin 1582 in countries that listened tothe Pope it took the rest of the worldcenturies to hop on board England andits colonies like the soon-to-be UnitedStates of America adopted the Gregorianin September of 1750 - by which pointtheir Julian dates were off from theseasons by 11 days hence thedisappearing of the 3rd through 13thwhen adopted the 1st of the year wasalso moved from March to January firstthis explains why George Washington'sbirthday has two answers although moreclosely hitched to the seasons than theJulian the Gregorian calendar stillisn't perfect its difference causesdates to become one day off from theseasons every 3,000 216 years othercalendars have been proposed like theone stand-up maths calculated thatdrifts off even more slowly his video isa great watch by the way but enough ofall of this let's sit back and enjoyEarth's movement without trying todivide it up and name it as a caveatkeep in mind that Earth's oceans andliquid insides and other celestialbodies are always pulling and tuggingand sloshing around minutely changingEarth's movements their effect ismeasurable but difficult to notice atbig scales and also don't look like muchin the short term short like the lengthof a human life looking from above theNorth Pole the equator spincounterclockwise at about sixteenseventy kilometers per hour relative tothe Sun Earth orbits counterclockwise atone hundred and eight thousandkilometers per hour along a path tilted23.4 degrees to it's spin within ourlocal neighborhood of stars our entiresolar system is drifting seventythousand kilometers per hour roughly inthe direction of the bright star Vega inthe constellation of Lyra and our solarsystem is part of a giant galaxy calledthe Milky Way on a plane tilted aboutsixty degrees approximately like thewindshield of a car looking from aboveEarth's North Pole our entire solarsystem races clockwise around thegalactic center at about seven hundredand ninety two thousand km/h our wholegalaxy is also moving through theuniverse we know this because when theuniverse was very young it was so hotelectrons and protons jumped around andphotons of light scattered constantlythey couldn't travel very far beforescattering again so the universe wasopaquebut then around 380,000 years after theBig Bang the universe cooled just enoughfor electrons and protons to formhydrogen suddenly abruptly photonsdecoupled from this

   "transcription": "hey Vsauce Michael here down here butwhich way is down and how much does downway well down raise about a hundredth ofa gram per cubic centimeter it is lightand airy which makes it a great sourceof insulation and buoyancy for waterbirds but if you let go of down it fallsdownso that's which way down is it's thedirection gravity is pulling everythingin now for someone on the other side ofthe earth my down is their up but whereare falling things going why do thingsfallare they being pushed or pulled or is itbecause of time travel first thingsfirst let's turn the Sun into a blackhole we can do that using universesandbox 2 this simulator will blow yourmind I love it in fact I love it so muchI put a code to keep the game for freein the current curiosity box if you'renot subscribed to the box yet you aremissing out okay look for the purposesof this video we want the solar systemand here it is notice that everything'smoving pretty quickly around the Sunthat's because we currently have thegame set so that every second thatpasses for us is 14 days almost in thegame if I change this to one secondwe're looking at the solar system inreal time you'll notice that it almostlooks like it's frozen even though theearth is traveling around the Sun atabout thirty kilometers per second itbarely appears to be moving that is howvast space is anyway let's go back to 14days I like that motion now look at theSun it is not currently a black hole butwe can change that what we need to do iscompress the Sun so let's lock its massso that it doesn't change while we makeits radius smallerlet's make its radius as small as we canand oh where to go what's still thereit's just become a black hole prettyspooky but now let's look at the rest ofthe solar system all rightzooming out and huh nothing's changed Imean something's changed it's colder anddarker but nothing's flying off intospace or getting sucked in you see byshrinking the Sun we didn't change thedirection of down for the planetsthey're always being pulled by gravitytowards its middle and making it smallerdidn't move where the middle was butalso the strength of that force pullingthem to the middle of the Sun stayed thesame that gives us a clue as to whatdown is the clue is the other thing wedidn't change mass mass is a measure ofhow hard it is to accelerate somethingto change its motion now right now thesetwo balls have zero motion relative tome slapping around this hollow plasticball is pretty easy but doing the sameto this solid steel ball there's a lotharder now gravity and weight havenothing to do with thisgravity acts downward not against myhorizontal slapping of course gravitydoes contribute to friction but frictionworks against me when I start moving theball but works with me when I stop theball and the steel ball is harder tostop than the plastic ball thedifference is mass the steel ball ismore massive it's more resistant tohaving its motion changed mass is anintrinsic property it does not depend onwhat's around or change from place toplace it can sometimes be thought of asthe amount of mattersomething has your mass is the sameregardless of where you are on the moonon earth in the middle of intergalacticspace floating around but all of thissaid mass does seem to care about what'saround mass loves companythings with mass and/or energy areattracted together by a force that wecall gravity the feeling of gravity isjust you and the earth being attractedto one another now every portion of anobject with mass attracts other portionstowards it the average of all thispulling is an attraction between centersof mass giant things like Earth exert anobvious pull but everything does even abaseball these two baseballs areattracted together by their own gravityz' except their masses are so small theforces minuscule and it can't overcomefriction or push air out of the waythey're never gonna come together but ifyou put two baseball's one meter apartin the middle of empty space where noother forces could act on them theywould literally fall together andcollide it would take three days tohappen but it would Isaac Newton foundthat the strength of the force bringingtwo things together is equal to theproduct of their masses divided by thedistance between their centers of masssquared times big G the gravitationalconstant if you make one of two objectsmore massive or move them closertogether the force will be stronger andthis force of attraction is what we callweight so mass is intrinsic whereasweight depends on what's aroundnow a weird thing happens when you weighyourself on most scales weight is aforce but scales display pounds orkilograms which are units of mass what'sgoing on is that a scale is activated bya force any force it doesn't have to becaused by gravity the scale thendisplays what amount of mass near thesurface of the earth would be attractedto the earth with the force it'sdetecting now since scales tend to beused on the surface of the earth bypeople on which the only force acting isgravity they tend to not be very far offbut they can be easily tricked and theyfurther lead to the confusion betweenmass and weightnotice that weight is mutual you arepulled down by earth with the same forcethat you pull up on earth according to ascale I weigh 180 pounds on earth[Music]and the earth weighs 180 pounds on mebut because the Earth's mass is so muchgreater than my ownand because the more massive somethingis the more it resists being moved ourequal and opposite weight forcesaccelerate me a lot more than the earthif you drop a pencil from a height of 6feet the pencil doesn't just fall to theearth more precisely they both cometogether they're attracted to each otherby equal forces but the same force movesthe pencil a lot more than the earthwhen you let go of the pencil the earthis literally pulled up to the pencil bythe pencils own gravity a distance equalto about 9 trillion the width of aproton that same force moves the pencilthe remaining distance which is stillpretty much 6 feet at the height of theInternational Space Station's orbit youand Earth are attracted about 10% lessthan when you're on the surface about8.8 times your mass but not zero forthis reason weightless astronauts inzero-gravity are neither weightless norin zero gravity their weight force failsto bring them and earth together becausethey move horizontally so quickly thatthey fall just as fast as Earth'ssurface curves away from them and eventhough they're experiencing 90% of thegravity you and I are feeling right nowthat's why they don't just fly awaythere are no forces called g-forces toresist their weight since everythingaround them is falling to its resistanceto your weight force stress deformationthat is needed for you to feel weightwhat astronauts in orbit actually lackis apparent weight likewise a heliumballoon has weight I mean it's made outof matter it clearly has mass so it'sattracted to theearth let's try to measure its weightforce that's a-ok it has negativeapparent weight that's because it'sattraction to the earth is weaker thanthe buoyant forces from the air aroundit that push it up now while it moves upit pushes air molecules down but theytransfer that force widely not justdirectly down onto the scalebuoyant forces are caused by the factthat whenever you are immersed in afluid like water or air moleculeslowered down are at greater pressurethat are being pressed by the weight ofall the molecules above them and arecloser to earth so they're pulled to itwith a stronger force now having greaterpressure means they pack a bigger punchwhen they collide with things sohorizontally those collisions cancel outbut vertically the stronger collisionsfrom below went out providing lift abuoyant forcenow this even happens on your own bodyacross its surface area air lifts youwith a force of about one Newton whichis equal to the weight force of an appleso if you weighed yourself in a vacuumyou would weigh about this much more butthat's not all Earth's spin causes it tobulge at the equator so the closer youare to it the further you are fromEarth's center of mass and the less youractual gravitational weight will be downis always changing I mean where isEarth's center of mass it would alwaysbe the same as Earth's geometric middleif Earth's composition was uniform butearth contains pockets of massive rockat different depths water mountains it'sgot moving changing insides and air andseasonal ice and though they're far awaygravity extends forever from everythingso the moon the Sun the planets all ofthem pull on you negligibly but trulyyou weigh about a millionth of yourweight less when the moon is directlyabove you this chunky shifting balanceof material on earth and everwhere else in the universe means thatdown is always changing on top of thatEarth's spin skews what you consider thedirection of down away from its centerof mass because the push you get fromEarth's spin seems to slightly lift youreducing your apparent weight andbending down towards the equator the netresult is an apparent weight reductionat the equator of about half of apercent if a scale guesses your massmust be 200 pounds at the polesit'll guess that you're 199 at theequator the 9.8 multiplier used so oftenin physics is calculated based on howthese factors affect someone at 45degrees latitude all of these influenceson the direction of down result in atotal vertical deflection that's onlyever at most a few arc seconds anywhereon earth that's not enough to be feltbut changes in direction and strengthcan be used to study the shape of theseafloor determine what's under you oreven help you discover ancient buriedrooms point is all of our downs aren't abunch of radially symmetric lines downis an uncombed mess now since solidsdon't flow they can have shapes thatdon't pay much mind to this but watercan flow so ignoring influences likewind and tides the surface of oceans andlakes and puddles is alwaysperpendicular to down if water couldpass through land or if earth weresubmerged in water gravity would be thesame everywhere along its bumpy surfacesuch a surface is called a geoid and canbe drawn at any altitude if you wantedto build a table that completelyenclosed the earth it would have to haverolling undulation z' nearly 100 metersat some points in order to be level sothat a ball placed anywhere on itwouldn't roll here is Earth's goeexaggerated a thousand times you'd weighabout a hundredth of a percent less afew grams here than you would say herewhere gravity is a bit stronger point isthe strength and directiondown is variable by location and changesover time so down is a fluctuatingvector easy enough except why shouldmatter attract matter in the first placeIsaac Newton was able to describeattraction but not explain ithumanity got closer however when AlbertEinstein introduced his general theoryof relativity Einstein thought a lotabout the fact that everything falls tothe ground at the same rate no matterhow massive something is when dropped itwill accelerate towards the earth downgaining about 9.8 meters per second forevery second that it falls that meansthat a hammer that's quite massive and anot so massive feather when dropped fromthe same height will hit the ground atthe same time okay what just happenedwas in error in order to fall throughair a thing has to push air out of theway but if it has a large surface areaand a low weight force it will have alot of air to move but will be able tomove that air very quickly in a vacuumthings do fall at the same rateregardless of mass this was famouslydemonstrated by Apollo 15 commanderDavid Scott on the moon that's weirdright I mean if a more massive object ispulled with a greater force shouldn't itfall faster well Newton's explanationwas simple larger masses are attractedwith greater forces but will alsorequire more force to be accelerated thesame as a less massive thing something ahundred times more massive might requirea hundred times the force but it will bepulled by gravity 100 times more soeverything falls to earth at the samerate what a fun coincidence right maybenotEinstein realized that there's anotherway for things to appear to falltogetherof their masses imagine a feather and ahammer floating in space in a room ifthe room is suddenly accelerated up at9.8 m/s^2the feather and the hammer will hit thefloor at the same time furthermorewhether it's the room coming up to meetthem or gravity being suddenly switchedonneither object will feel any forcepushing them there's no way to tellwhich of these happened this isEinstein's famous equivalence principlehe once admitted that his greatestthought ever was that of a man fallingoff of a roof while falling the manwould not feel any forces on him eventhough he's speeding up freefall isindistinguishable from floating alone inspace from having no forces on you fromnot being moved what if gravity isn't aforce at all what if things fall notbecause they're being pushed or pulledbut because they're not being pushed orpulled to see how this could be we needto talk about straight lines what I havehere is a retractable ID badge holderthis is a great way to test for straightpaths because the string is always kepttaut the card I have behind has twolines drawn on it and if while I pullthe string out it always stays betweenthose two lines I will know that I neverturned while I pulled it because anyturn will translate into a differentangle between the lines on the card andthe string now if I put two of these ona flat table and pull them out alwaysensuring that they go straight aheadthey will never meet they will beforever parallel but now let's put themon a sphere a curved surface again Ipull both strings forward making surethat they always are pulled out straightno turning wait they came togetherwell they didn't turn look maybe there'ssome kind of weird force that pulled myhands together and just like gravity Ididn't feel it but it happened no whathappened was not the result of a forceit was just a natural result ofcurvature you might be thinking wait asecond are those really straight lines Imean they don't look that straight to meOh also what if they've just moved alonglatitude lines then they'd never cometogether and those look pretty darnstraight but they're not a straight linenever turns and although latitude lineslook straight at first glance followingone requires turning to find straightline paths on surfaces whether they'reflat like this or curvedI love the ribbon test now you can usean actual ribbon but I have found that astrip of paper works even better let'stake a look at this path right here it'sstraight at first but then it curves nowif two people are traveling along thiscurve and they want to stay together theperson on the inside will have to covera shorter distance than the person onthe outside since both sides of thisstrip of paper cannot change theirlengths they'll help us find a straightpathif the strip of paper can lay flat we'llknow that we have found a straight lineand as you can see the strip can layflat and follow the straight part ofthis path but when it comes to the curvein order to follow the path now thestrip well it has too much material onthe inside and that material bunches upand leaves the plane therefore we knowthat this part of the path is notstraightlet's use the ribbon test to findstraight lines on the surface of a conewell from the looks of it aligneddirectly from the base to the tip seemslike it would be straight and sureenough yeahthe ribbon lays flat on that path butwhat about a ring around the cone nopedoesn't work shorter distances aroundnearer the tip of the cone mean thatthere's too much ribbon up at the top soit doesn't lay flat let's see what elseis there though besides this well if Istart here and just allow the ribbon tolay flat huh I get a little curvylooking shape like this I say curvylooking because while to someone say atthe base this path might seem to go upslow down change direction and then falldown faster and faster since a ribbon onsuch a path is flat it's actually forinhabitants on the cones surfaceperfectly straight if we trace theribbons path on to the cone we can seethis clearly because a cone can beflattened a straight line on a curvedsurface is called a geodesic here is ageodesic on a sphere the Equator is onehere's another a line of latitude is nota geodesic it's not a straight line tosee why let's try to follow it with theribbon you know what I have to keep kindof lifting it yeah see distances aroundthe sphere becomes shorter as we go upso there's too much material on theribbon up here and it leaves the surfacethis path contains turns and in order toturn a force has to act on you if noforces did this is the path you wouldtake notice that the ribbon beginsmoving due eastbut then falls southFalls Einstein realized that curvaturecould cause things to be seeminglyattracted to one another without needingto invent the existence of forces likegravity but attraction only happens ifthings move along the surface if theystay still they well they don't cometogether so for something at resthow does falling begin I mean the thinghas to move in this direction but it'sat rest rightwell yes but it's only at rest in spaceand that's not the whole storyup down forward backward and left-rightare all you need to describe where anevent occur but a complete descriptionwill also need to describe when togetherthese four dimensions formed a settingin which everything in our universehappens space-time since we can talkabout a falling pencil using just onespatial dimension up and down we can usea piece of paper to model space-time forit okay so we've got up and down but wehave to add another direction the pencilmoves in time now if no forces act onthe pencil it won't move through spaceit will only get older and as you cansee if all it does is get older it won'tfall if space-time was flat when I letgo of the pencil it wouldn't go anywherebut now let's allow the earth which ismassive to manipulate space-time intosay a cone now with no forces acting onit every part of the pencil follows astraight line but on a cone as we sawearlier such a path will look like thisit will fall this is because distancesaround the cone are shorter higher uptime runs faster further from a massiveobject but to go straight not turn everypart of the pencil must cover an equaldistance in space-time like thisonly when the pencil hits the earth doesthe repulsion of their mutual electronsprovide a force pushing the pencil off ageodesic for the earth time is a seriesof slicesfrom this evolution the pencilsforce-free geodesic is why it falls nota push or pull just the pencils naturaltendency to follow a straight line untilsomething acts on it now we only usedone dimension of space and one of timebecause visualizing our two universesthree of space and one of time wouldtake us beyond the limits of what couldbe shown on paper or screens but mathcan take us there general relativityallows us to calculate how much mass andenergy curved space-time and has beenused to explain things that Newton'solder theory of falling as the result offorces couldn't like anomalies in theorbit of mercury which orbits nearestthe Sun and is therefore most affectedby the sun's grip on space-time manyother experiments have confirmed generalrelativity's picture of the universefitting the conclusion that there is nogravitythere's just space-time its curvatureand a senate as John Wheeler famouslyput it space-time grips mass telling ithow to move mass grips space-timetelling it how to curve relative to theearth we don't move very fast even jetairplanes move negligibly close to thespeed of light so relative to earth wemove almost exclusively through time assuch we are more affected by the waytime is curved by mass than how space iscurved this has led many to claim thatfor the most part you feel as thoughyou're being pushed into the ground notbecause of a force called gravity butbecause time is moving faster for yourhead than for your feet down is relativeand always changing but it existsbecause of and is always in thedirection of slower time BertrandRussell called this the law of cosmiclaziness everything is naturally steeredtowards where time is slowest we callthis falling goingso you don't have to keep anything onthe down-lowtime will take care of that for you andas always thanks for

   "title": "What's The Most Dangerous Place on Earth?",
   "publishedAt": "20 Jan 2013",
   "transcription": "Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. 93% of all thehumans who have ever lived are dead. For everyperson alive right now, there are 15 peoplewho are no longer alive. The Earth is dangerous...butwhere is the most dangerous place on Earth?Ignoring freak occurrances, where is the mostpersistently perilous place on the surface of our planet?Well, let's being with temperature. Extremeheat and extreme cold can kill within hours,if not minutes. In cold environments, withoutclothing, the human body, by itself, doesn'tdo a very good job of maintaining a high enoughtemperature to live. It just takes too muchwork. Even when you feel comfortable and warm,nearly half of your daily caloric intake isused merely to keep your body's temperaturewhere it should be.If you took a human and stripped them nakedand put them in an environment at 0 degreesCelsius, they would die from having too coldof an internal temperature within about 20minutes. We need warmth. But one thing weneed more immediately than that is oxygen.And that brings us to the summit of Mount Everest.This place on the surface of Earthhas incredibly thin air. At the top of Mount Everestthere is only one third as much breathable oxygenas there is down at sea level.Climbers can endure the conditions for shortperiods of time if they acclimate for months,but if you were to teleport from whereveryou are right now directly to the summit ofEverest, you would most likely die withinonly 2-3 minutes because there isn't enoughoxygen.Death would come even more quickly if youwere at the bottom of the Mariana Trench.There, you would be submerged under nearly7 miles of water, about 11 km, causing thepressure around your body to exceed 15,000pounds per square inch.At normal swimming depths you can alwayshold your breath, but that far down, withthat much pressure, your lungs would collapseimmediately, and without oxygen your brainwould go unconscious in 15 seconds,and you'd be dead in under 90.You would die pretty much just as quicklyas someone who walked into outer space withouta suit on.But falling into a molten lake of lava isprobably the most spectacular way to go. Contraryto what you see in many movies, your bodywouldn't just burn a little bit and slowlysink as if it were in quicksand. Instead, there would be a lot of fireworks. Hot, moltenlava is liquid rock, 4 times as hot as youroven can ever get. And the human body ismainly made up of water, which, when exposedto that kind of heat, turns into steam...explosively.There's a fantastic video right here on YouTubewhere a guy throws a bag of organic materialcontaining a lot of moisture into hot lava.It doesn't just sink in, it causes a miniatureeruption. I highly suggest you go watch it.But what if we want to measure danger notby how quickly you would die, but by the actualtotal number of fatalities caused. Well, forthis, we're going to need to get much, muchsmaller. Like, microscopic.In 1918, influenza killed nearly 100 millionpeople, which, at the time, was 3% of theworld's entire population. But places whereand when the plague has spread rapidly areeven scarier. Between 1347 and 1353, a thirdof everybody in Europe died because of thebubonic plague,an infection caused by Yersinia Pestis.It's easy to think of the plague as somethingfrom way back in the past, but it is stillhere. Of course, now we have antibiotics, whichcan help in most cases, but, believe it ornot, in America alone, 5 to 15 peoplestill get the plague every year.In terms of total fatalities, however, theplague and influenza are nothing comparedto the danger caused by this guy: plasmodium.It's a micro-organism that can get into ourblood because of mosquito bites, and causesMalaria. Across the totality of human history,the number of deaths attributed to Malariais unbelievable. Researchers like Nobel laureateBaruch Blumberg have studied the history ofthe human genome and human migration, anddetermined that of all the humans who haveever existed, it is likely that half died from malaria.So, in terms of total fatalities across allof human history, a place where plasmodiumcould enter the blood stream because of amosquito bite, statistically speaking, couldbe called the most dangerous place on Earth.But let's switch gears for a moment and talkabout places that are dangerous not becauseof Earth, or Earth's creatures, well, actually,just one specific creature: us.La Oroya is a mining town in Peru where themurder rate is low but pollution is high.The town's smelter emits pollution into the airand temperature inversions in the atmosphereabove the town trap gasses within,causing the town to have 85 times more arsenic inits air than is deemed safe.But that's nothing compared to Lake Karachayin Russia. It was named the most pollutedspot on Earth by the World Watch Instituteon Nuclear Waste.The lake contains so many radioactive pollutantsthat you can receive a lethal dose of radiationmerely by standing for one hour near certainparts of the lake.The Global Peace Index ranks countries byhow safe they are. It takes into account anumber of factors including crime and politicalcorruption. The safest country, accordingto the Index, is Iceland.And the least safe is Somalia.But for the highest murder rate you'll haveto go to Juarez, Mexico, where out of every1 million inhabitants, each year 1,477of them are murdered.I've always found it amazing just how manyserial killers Miami seems to have on theshow \"Dexter.\" But Miami is a big city andso despite all those serial killers, it'smurder rate in the show is not the highestof any fictional town from a TV show. Thathonor goes to Cabot Cove, the town where \"MurderShe Wrote\" occurred. An analysis of \"MurderShe Wrote\" episodes revealed 274 murders,but a population in the town of only 3,500,making Cabot Cove's murder rate1,490 per million inhabitants.Until recently that number was unmatched byreality, but last year, the city of San PedroSula in Honduras reported a murder rate of1,588 murders per million inhabitants.Let's conclude by revisiting pollution, specificallythe Chernobyl accident, and a certain oxymoronicdanger. For 10 days in 1986, radioactive isotopesspilled out of a blazing reactor core, forcingmass evacuations. It's more than 25 yearslater now and many parts of the exclusionzone remain incredibly lethal. But withouthumans there, many parts of the exclusionzone have seen wildlife flourish, especiallyendangered species which can go to the exclusionzone, live, reproduce, and be safe...from us.We managed to ruin a place to the pointat which it endangered our lives and we hadto leave and in doing so we left partsof it a little bit safer for other forms of life.You can read more about all of these topicsby following links down in the descriptionbelow.Keep learning.And as always,thanks for watching.",

   "transcription": "Using GPS, these trails represent pizza deliveryin Manhattan on a typical Friday night.And is this a frog or a orse?It's episode 52 of IMG!This lemon looks yellow to me, and it probablylooks yellow to you as well, but not inthe same way. You see, here in this room,this lemon is \"Subtractively Yellow.\" It absorbsall visible wavelengths of light except foryellow light, which it reflects onto my retina.But the screen that you are using to watchthis video doesn't produce yellow light atall. In fact, it can only produce red, blue,or green light. The really cool, but kindof disturbing thing about this is that herein the room, I am actually seeing \"real\" yellowlight. But you are seeing \"fake\" yellow. Absolutelyno yellow is coming off your screen and fallingonto your retina. But it still looks yellowbecause it's quite easy to lie to the brain.Our retinas contain three different typesof cone cells that are receptive to colorand each one is best suited to detect a certaincolor. One is great for blue, the other isgreat for green and the third is great forred. Notice that there is no individual celllooking for yellow. So, the way we actuallysee yellow happens like this. The wavelengthof yellow light falls between the wavelengthsof red and green. And, so, when an objectreflects yellow light onto your retina, boththe green and the red cones are slightly activated,which your brain notices and says \"well, that'swhat happens when something's yellow, so itmust be yellow.\"All a computer monitor or a mobile phone screenhas to do to make you think you're seeingyellow is send a little bit of red and a littlebit of green light at you. As long as thepixels and the little subpixels on them aresmall enough that you can't distinguish themindividually, your brain will just say \"well,I'm recieving some red and some green, that'swhat yellow things do...hmm...it must be yellow.\"Even though it actually is not...Lemons can also produce electricity. A littlebit of zinc, a little bit of copper, and boom,you're moving electrons around. But not thatmany, I mean, the current voltage are quitelow.You could run an LCD, but even a potato could do that...If you wanted to run a flashlight bulb, thatwould take 3,000 lemons. And if you wantedto run a halogen bulb, well, that would take37,000 lemons. But artist Caleb Charlanddoesn't care.He spent 11 hours hammering nails into 300living apples hanging on trees. By connectingthem to a household lamp, he was able to makeit glow just dimly enough to capture thisimage with a 4 hour exposure.Less alive and more frightening are SteveShaheen's sculptures: little dudes with bulbheads desperately trying to plug themselves in.Merve Kahraman's \"Revitalizer\" never dies.It's a lightbulb surrounded by wax. Now, thewax melts because of the lightbulbs heat,and drips into a special container into allkinds of weird new shapes, but whenever youwant you can just flip it so that the new,cooled wax is at the top.But my favorite is the Fukusada wooden lightbulb.It looks like a solid block of wood, but it'sactually hollow and chipped to a nearly paper-thinwidth. When you turn it on you can see thelight coming from inside.Combos.Artist Tang Yau Hoong blew my mind this week.We've got clear days and smoke, boats andcrocs, whales and hearts, Pie-bike, brainsand boxing gloves, day and night, but don'tbe scared, you can always paint yourself somelight. Or just swing on some light.Ok, let's frame it this way. Climbing Wall.This fitness club in Japan uses frames andother pretty interior elements to create adecidedly less rugged climbing wall.But let's get simple. Like, minimal.Thanks to Lego, here are their bricks arrangedto represent famous characters. Enjoy.Now for some Art Illusions.Here's a cute couple, but can you see, inthis very same image, the baby they will soonhave? Or how about these zebras? There'sa lion hiding amongst them. Can you find it?Billboards can be clever, but here's a greatone that makes it look like someone is pushingout a section of the building.But how many of you will remember seeing it?If we assume that you don't remember experiencingmajor cultural events before you're 5 or 6years old, that means that every year thereare fewer and fewer people alive who rememberexperiencing recent historical events.xkcd made this amazing chart to show when,in the future, the majority, more than halfof living americans, will not remember beingalive when certain things happened. For instance,he calculated using data from the US CensusBureau that 2012, this very year, is thefirst year in American history since in whichfewer than half of living Americans rememberbeing alive in the 1970's.By 2041, most of us won't remember a timewhen Pluto was actually called a planet. By2043, most of us alive won't remember livingduring George W. Bush's presidency. And by2047, more than half of living Americanswill not have been alive to have rememberedanything that you did today.Like when you made that funny face in theyearbook. No, no, no, THAT funny face.If you're not following @tweetsauce, you'remissing out on daily Vsaucey content, mostof which never makes it to a video. So gofollow us on Twitter and I'm gonna leave youwith another combo.

times a word is used is justproportional to one over its rank wordfrequency and ranking on a log-log graphfollow a nice straight line a power-lawthis phenomenon is called zips law andit doesn't only apply to english it alsoapplies to other languages like well allof them even ancient languages wehaven't been able to translate yet andhere's the thing we have no idea whyit's surprising that something ascomplex as reality should be conveyed bysomething as creative as language insuch a predictable way how predictablewe'll watch this according to word countdot org which ranks words as found inthe british national corpus sauce is thefive thousand five hundred and fiftyfifth most common English word now hereis a list of how many times every wordon Wikipedia and in the entire Gutenbergcorpus of tens of thousands of publicdomain books shows up the most used wordthe shows up about 181 million timesknowing these two things we can estimatethat the word sauce should appear about30 thousand times on Wikipedia andGutenberg combined and it pretty muchdoes what gives the world is chaoticthings are distributed in myriads ofways not just power laws and language ispersonal intentional idiosyncratic whatabout the world and ourselves couldcause such complex activities andbehaviors to follow such a basic rule weliterally don't know more than a centuryof research has yet to

conclusions and thisvideo doesn't contain a definiteexplanation either sorry I know that's abummer since we appear to like knowingmore than mystery but that said we alsoasked more than we answer so let's divein to zips ramifications some relatedpatterns some possible explanations andthe depth of the mystery itselfzip slaw was popularized by George Zippa linguist at Harvard University it is adiscrete form of the continuous Paretodistribution from which we get thePareto principle because so manyreal-world processes behave this waythe Pareto principle tells us that as arule of thumb it's worth assuming that20% of the causes are responsible for80% of the outcome like in languagewhere the most frequently used eighteenpercent of words account for over 80% ofword occurrences in 1896 vilfredo paretoshowed that approximately 80% of theland in Italy was owned by just 20% ofthe population it is said that he laternoticed in his garden 20% of his peapods contained 80% of the Peashe and other researchers looked at otherdatasets and found that this 8020imbalance comes up a lot in the worldthe richest 20% of humans have 80 2.7percent of the world's income in theu.s. 20% of patients use 80 percent ofhealthcare resources in 2002 Microsoftreported that 80% of the errors andcrashes in Windows and Office are causedby 20% of the bugs detected a commonrule of thumb in the business worldstates that 20 percent of your customersare responsible for 80% of your profitsand 80 percent of the complaints youreceive will come from 20% of yourcustomers a book titled the 8020principle even says that in a home oroffice 20 percent of the carpet receives80 percent of the where oh and as WoodyAllen famously said 80 percent ofsuccess is just showing upthe Pareto principle is everywhere whichis good by focusing on just 20% ofwhat's wrongyou could often expect to solve 80% ofthe problems a variety of differentunrelated factors cause this to be truefrom case to case but if we can get tothe bottom of what causes some of themmaybe we'll find that one or more ofthose mechanisms is responsible for zipslaw in language George Zipp himselfthought languages interesting rankedfrequency distribution was a consequenceof the principle of least effort thetendency for life and things to followthe path of least resistance Ziffbelieved it drove much of human behaviorand hypothesized that as languagedeveloped in our species speakersnaturally preferred drawing from as fewwords as possible to get their thoughtsout there it was easier but in order tounderstand what was being saidlisteners preferred larger vocabulariesthat gave more specificity so that theyhad to do less work the compromisebetween listening and speakingzip felt led to the current state oflanguage a few words are used often andmany many many words are used rarelyrecent papers have suggested that havinga few short often used predictable wordshelps dissipate information load densityon listeners spacing out important vocabso that the information rate is moreconstantthis makes sense and much has beenlearned by applying the least effortprinciple to other behaviors but laterresearchers argued that for language theexplanation was even more simple just afew years after zips seminal paperbenoit mandelbrot showed that there maybe nothing mysterious about zips law atall because even if you just randomlytype on a keyboard you will producewords distributed according to zips lawit's a pretty cool point and this is whyit happens there are exponentially moredifferent long words than short wordsfor instance the English alphabet can beused to make 26 one letter words but 26squared two letter words also in randomtyping whenever the spacebar is presseda word terminates since there's always acertain chance that the spacebar will bepressed longer stretches of time beforeit happens are exponentially less likelythan shorter ones the combination ofthese Exponential's is pretty zippy forexample if all 26 letters and thespacebar are equally likely to be typedafter a letter is typed and a word hasbegun the probability that the nextinput will be a space thus creating aone letter word is just one in 27 andsure enough if you randomly generatecharacters or hire a proverbial typingmonkey about one out of every 27 orthree point seven percent of the stuffbetween spaces will be single letterstwo letter words appear when afterbeginning a word any character but thespace bar is hit a 26 and 27 chance andthen the space bar a three letter wordis the probability of a letter anotherletter and then a space if we divide bythe number of unique words of eachlength there can be we get the frequencyof occurrence expected for anyparticular word given its length forexample the letter V will make up aboutpoint 1 42 percentof random typing the word Vsauce pointzero zero zero zero zero zero zero zeronine nine three percent longer words areless likely but watch this let's spreadthese frequencies out according to theranks they'd take up on a most oftenused list there are 26 possible 1 letterwords so each of the top 26 ranked wordsare expected to occur about this oftenthe next 676 ranks will be taken up bytwo letter words that show up about thisoften if we extend each frequencyaccording to how many members it has weget zip subsequent researchers havedetailed how changing up the initialconditions can smooth the steps out ourmysterious distribution has been createdout of nothing but the inevitabilitiesof math so maybe there is no mysterymaybe words are just the result ofhumans randomly segmenting theobservable world and the mental worldinto labels and zips law describes whatnaturally happens when you do that caseclosedand as always thanks for what wait aminute actual language is very differentfrom random typing communication isdeterministic to a certain extentutterances and topics arrive based onwhat was said before and the vocabularywe have to work with certainly isn't theresult of purely random naming forexample the monkey typing model can'texplain why even the names of theelements the planets end the days of theweek are used in language according tozips law sets like these are constrainedby the natural world and they're not theresult of us randomly segmenting theworld into labelsfurthermore when given a list of novelwords words they've never heard or usedbefore like when prompted to write astory about alien creatures with strangenames people will naturally tend to usethe name of one alien twice as often asanother three times as often as anotherzips law appears to be built into ourbrains perhaps there is something aboutthe way thoughts and topics ofdiscussion a band flow that contributesto zips law another way zippy anddistributions occur is via processesthat change according to how they'vepreviously operated these are calledpreferential attachment processes theyoccur when something money viewsattention variation friends jobsanything really is given out accordingto how much is already possessed to goback to the carpet example if mostpeople walk from the living room to thekitchen across a certain path furniturewill be placed elsewhere making thatpath even more popular the more views avideo or image or post has the morelikely it is to get recommendedautomatically or make the news forhaving so many views both of which giveit more views it's like a snowballrolling down a snowy hill the more snowit accumulates the bigger its surfacearea becomes for collecting more and thefaster it grows there doesn't have to bea deliberate choice driving apreferential attachment process it canhappen naturally try this take a bunchof paper clips and grab any two atrandom link them together and then throwthem back in the pile now repeat overand over again if you grab paper clipsthat are already part of a chain linkthem anyway more often than not after awhile you will have a distribution thatlooks as if Ian's a small number ofchains contain a disproportionate amountof the total paper clip count this issimply because the longer a chain getsthe greater proportion of the whole itcontains which gives it a better chanceof being picked up in the future andconsequently made even longer the richget richer the big get bigger thepopular get popular it's just mathperhaps languages Ziff mystery is if notcaused by at least strengthened byprefferRachele attachment once a word is usedit's more likely to be used against sooncritical points may play a role as wellwriting and conversation often stick toa topic until a critical point isreached and the subject is changed andthe vocabulary shifts processes likethese are known to result in power lawsso in the end it seems tenable that allthese mechanisms might collude to makeZips law the most natural way forlanguage to be perhaps some of ourvocabulary and grammar was developedrandomly according to Mandelbrot'stheory and the natural way conversationand discussion follow preferentialattachment and criticality coupled withthe principle of least effort whenspeaking and listening are allresponsible for the relationship betweenword rank and frequency it's a shamethat the answer isn't simpler but it'sfascinating because of the consequencesit has on what communication is made ofroughly speaking and this ismind-blowing nearly half of any bookconversation or article will be nothingbut the same 50 to 100 words and nearlythe other half will be words that appearin that selection only once that's notso surprising when you consider the factthat one word accounts for six percentof what we say the top 25 most usedwords make up about 1/3 of everything wesay and the top 100 about half seriouslyI mean whether it's all the words in wethot American summer or all the words inPlato's Complete Works or in thecomplete works of Edgar Allen Poe or theBible itself only about 100 words areused for nearly half of everythingwritten or said in Alice's Adventures inWonderland 44 percent and in Tom Sawyerforty-nine point eight percent of theunique words used appear onlyonce in the book a word that is usedonly once in a given selection of wordsis called a hey pax legume anon hey paxlag Amina are vitally important tounderstanding languages if a word hasonly been found once in the entire knowncollection of an ancient language it canbe very difficult to figure out what itmeans now there is no corpus ofeverything ever said or written inEnglish but there are very very largecollections and it's fun to find hey paxlagaa Mona in them for instance and thisprobably won't be the case after Imention it but the word quiz Aish ouslyis in the Oxford English Dictionary butappears nowhere on Wikipedia or in thegutenberg corpus or in the britishnational corpus or the american

inthe parodist rattled off quiz Asia Sleehey Vsauce Michael here but who isMichael and how much does he weighit's a little sad that quiz Asia Sleehas been used so infrequently it's a funword but that's the way things go in azip ian's system some things get all thelove some get little most of what youexperience on a day to day basis isforgotten forgettable the dictionary ofobscure sorrows as it often does has aword for thisOh Lika the awareness of how few daysare memorable I've been alive for almost11,000 days but I couldn't tell yousomething about each one of them I meannot even close most of what we do andsee and think and say and hear and feelis forgotten at a rate quite similar tozip slaw which makes sense if a numberof factors naturally selected forthinking and talking about the worldwith tools in a zip Ian way it makessense we'd remember it that way to somethings really well most things hardly atall but it bums me out sometimes becauseit means that so much is forgotten eventhings that at the time you thought youcould never forget my locker numbersenior year it's combination the jokes Iliked when I saw a comedian on stage thenames of people I saw every day 10 yearsago so many memories are gone when Ilook at all the books I've read andrealize that I can't remember everydetail from them it's a littledisappointingI mean why even bother if the Paretoprinciple

   "transcription": "Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. This is Earth asseen from Saturn. That is us right there.And if you look closely, ok, see thislittle protuberance? That's the Moon.This image was taken by the Cassinispacecraft on July 19th, 2013 at 21:27Coordinated Universal Time. The thing is,NASA gave the public advanced warningof when it would be taken, which meansthat this image of Earth was the firstever taken from space that some people onEarth were actually posing for. Our planetlooks so small, insignificant, fragile.I recently attended the premiere of Sky1's upcoming \"You, Me and the Apocalypse\"with some cool YouTubers and it got methinking. In the show, the characters findout that they're only 34 days left beforea comet smashes into Earth that's likelyto end humanity. They all react indifferent interesting ways, but whatwould I do if I found out that therewere only 34 daysof human history left? Ok, my first prioritywould be to get back to America to bewith my family.But after that? I don't really have abucket list. Except that is exactly whatI would want to spend my last few weeksdoing. Making a list to put in a bucketthat I would then send far out intospace away from Earth's impendingvaporization. The list would containinformation about us, all Earthlings. Sothat if libraries and monuments andYouTube videos were all destroyed, arecord would still exist somewhereof what and who we were. Like a stonethrown into a lake, the ripples your lifecauses last long after you vanish,the tree you planted is climbed by futuregenerations, the books you donated informfuture readers. But what if it's not justyour stone that vanishes, but the entire pond?Perhaps it's arrogance or vanity, butgetting cosmic messages in a bottle outthere, before the end, diversifies ourarchive and gives a better chance forfuture alien visitors, or whatever isleft of humanity, to find out that wewere once here,to show what we learned. Maybe even to warnfuture life forms of what we did or whatwe didn't prepare for. We have alreadysent some messages about humanity outthere, beyond Earth, and if Earth iscompletely destroyed, those messages willbe all that's left of us. What are they?Ok, first things first. How do you writesomething for the future? I mean,the distant future. The message might not befound for millions of years or billions.It might be discovered by an audiencethat's completely different, not only inlanguage, but in senses? What ifthey can't see or hear or feel or tasteor smell like we do, or at all.What if their bodies destroy the very materialwe write the message on? What languagedo you even write it in? Well, in general, mathand physics, which are believed to be thesame everywhere in the universe,have been what we write outer space boundmessages in.Like the Arecibo message, written byFrank Drake, Carl Sagan and others, whichwas blasted towards the M13 star clusterin 1974. It's composed of a semi primenumber of binary digits conveying someinfo about us and it should reach thecenter-ish of the M13 cluster in about25,000 years, at whichpoint, if something intelligent livesthere and detects it, they can respondand their response will return to usanother 25,000 years later. We won't bearound for that. But Earth has also beenbroadcasting its radio and TV signalsinto space. Currently it's about 200light-years in diameter. Compared to theMilky Way, it's about this big. Aliens withinthat bubble could tune in and listen toprograms we sent out through ourairwaves, but these signals thin out as thebubble expands. Across very largedistances they may be essentiallyimpossible to tune into.Maybe a physical time capsule would bemore permanent, but it can't be buried onEarth if Earth is about to be ravaged.A time capsule in orbit might be smart,like LAGEOS-1, a satellite put into orbitin 1976 that allows for very preciselaser measurements of positions on Earth, but also contains a plaque designed by Carl Sagan, uponwhich is written the numbers 1 to 10 in the binary, and the arrangement of the Earth's continents 250 million years ago,today and their estimated arrangementin 8.4 million years, which is how long we believethe satellite's orbit will be stable. Drag caused by the thin atmosphere up where it orbits andinfluences like solar activitywill eventually cause it to fall back downto Earth, but its plaque will serve as atime capsule - a message from us today towhatever happens to be alive orintelligent here on Earth8 million years in the future.To put that in perspective, the pyramidswere only built about 5,000 years ago.8 million years ago, there weren't evenhumans on the Earth. The latest common ancestor ofhumans and chimpanzees was around though.8 million years from today, when LAGEOSreturns, what will intelligent life onEarth look like? If Earth's surface isbarren of life at that point, LAGEOS-1will be alone. But what aboutsatellites in geostationary orbits? Theseorbits are far enough out that they'remuch safer from atmospheric drag andcould remain above Earth much muchlonger than satellites like LAGEOS.These satellites are our pyramids. They'resmaller than monuments built by pastcivilizations, but impervious to anythingthat might go wrong on the less stablesurface of our planet. If alienarchaeologists come by in a billionyears or so, these satellites may be whattheir alien encyclopedias use as thepicture for the humans article. So far wehave erected about 450of these geostationary monuments.When such a satellite wears down andceases to be operational, it takes a lotof energy to slow it down so it can moveout of the way and fall to Earth to burn up inthe atmosphere. So instead, they'reusually pushed into what's known as agraveyard orbit.A shell around the planet where they canbe part without interfering withimportant operational satellites.It's fitting that we call these graveyardorbits because tombs are often the moststunning things we have from previouscivilizations. These graveyard orbits aretombs in a way. Not for kings, but formachines. Junkyards that will out-exist thevery societies and people they solargely define. Luckily, a few containmore than just our craftsmanship. Theyalso contain a record, like EchoStar XVI,a communications satellite launched intogeostationary orbit in 2012. Aboard it is asilicon disc created by artist TrevorPaglen, containing 100 images ofEarth and Earthlings. Now, unlike LAGEOS,EchoStar XVI will likely remain in orbitfor billions of years,safe from discord and change down here.But here's the thing. What if our entiresolar system is lost? Or what if life outthere doesn't decide to ever visit oursystem? Well, in that case, we have sentinterstellar messages. At this moment, sofar, there are 11 distinct human madethings on trajectories out of thesolar system into interstellar space.They're all related to five probes.Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, Voyager 1 andVoyager 2 and New Horizons, the thingthat recently made a Pluto flyby.These objects are our most distant hellos.Over the next ten thousand, million,billion years, they'll pass close enoughto other star systems, maybe even planets,to possibly be discovered by otherintelligent life forms. We had theforesight to include special messages onthese probes. The Pioneer plaques areattached to Pioneer 10 and 11, whichlaunched in the early 1970's,were the first human-made objects toever be sent on a trajectory to not justleave Earth, but to leave the solarsystem entirely. If discovered by otherlife out there, these plaques, designed byFrank Drake and Carl Sagan,could be our first chance to say \"hello,we exist,\" or, depending on how longhumanity lasts, our only chance to say\"Hello,we existed. This is what we were.\" But willthe plaques makes sense to aliens? Manyhumans scientists have had troubledeciphering their meaning, but here'swhat they say. At the bottom is a map ofour solar system with a path showing thePioneer probe itself and where it camefrom. This element has been particularlycriticized for being human centric.I mean, an arrow? Who's to say aliens will knowthat this depicts a path and not somestructure in our solar system? Also, it'san arrow. Arrows might convey this wayonly two civilizations that hunted ordeveloped pointy projectiles. Anyway. Up here, we define units. You can't tellaliens about humans or Earth by usingseconds, kilometres or light years,because we made those measurements up.Instead, the plaque uses hyperfinetransitions to communicate distances and time.The hope is that curiousintelligent life forms who find thiswill understand that this is a hydrogenatom - one proton, one electron. Hydrogen isthe most abundant element in theuniverse, so hopefully its propertieswill be a common point of understanding.Now sometimes, if you've got enoughhydrogen around, you can catch atoms inthe heap transitioning between particleswith parallel spins and antiparallelspins. Now, whenever this transitionhappens, electromagnetic radiation isreleased with a period of about 2.7nanoseconds and a wavelength of about21 centimetres. It's hoped thataliens equate this tick mark with thesetwo units of measurement. For example,the woman is said to be, in binary, eight ofthese units tall. 21 centimetres timeseight is a 168 centimetres.You would think that puttingthe probe itself behind them for scalewould be enough to show our size,but having both might help solidify theconnection. This diagram is meant to showwhere we live. We are in the middle.The direction and proportional length ofthe lines show where distant pulsars are.A tick-mark near the ends of each lineshows the third direction, behind or infront of the plaque, that the line shouldgo in. In binary, next to each line is theperiod of each pulsar. Again, in thetime units described above. If aliensmake this connection they could possiblymatch the periods with the correctpulsars in real life,triangulate our position and come say hello.Also, since the period of a pulsarchanges over time, they could use ourobserved periods to date back how longago this plaque was made. So that's howthe plaque works. It kind of feels likewe're just sending out a bunch ofscience homework to space, but how elsecan you find common ground withsomething that might not resemble you inany way you could even imagine? Despiteheading out first,the Pioneer plaques are not the firstphysical messages made by us to gointerstellar.That title belongs to Voyager 1.Currently moving at 17 km/s, it isthe most far-out thing humans have ever made.Literally. In about 40,000 years,both Voyagers will pass within less thantwo light years of other stars.If aliens find them, or if futurehumans find them, a golden record is attached toboth that contains information abouthumanity. The record is made of goldplated copper with an aluminum cover,containing some uranium 238. Given itshalf-life, smart aliens could analyze itto determine how long ago the record wasmade. On the record is the inscription tothe makers of music All Worlds All Times.The record contains 116 images, as wellas audio and video recordings of humans,animals, songs and greetings in fiftyfive languages. Printed on the record areinstructions for playback and info aboutus. The hydrogen hyperfine transitionunit definition and the Pulsar map,included on the Pioneer plaques, but therecord also comes with a stylus andplatter to play it. Instructions for usingthe stylus are on the record. This is apicture of the stylus being usedcorrectly and then in binary using thetransition units, the record tells thealiens that the stylus should go aroundthe record once every 3.6 secondsto play back correctly and intotal should take about one hour to do so.For the video portion, instructionsare given in a circle. The first videoimage is displayed, so they know they didit right.Also included on the record is a messagefrom then-president of the United States,Jimmy Carter. There's somethingvulnerable about the message. It'sdelivered to an unknown recipient,like when someone in a horror movie asksinto the darkness \"Is anyone there?Hello?\" This is what it says. \"We cast this messageinto the cosmos. It is likely to survivea billion years into the future, when ourcivilization is profoundly altered andthe surface of the Earthmay be vastly changed. Of the two hundredbillion stars in the Milky Way galaxy,some, perhaps many, may have inhabitedplanets and space faring civilizations.If one such civilization interceptsVoyager and can understand theserecorded contents, here is our message.This is a present from a small, distantworld. A token of our sounds, our science,our images, our music, our thoughts andour feelings. We are attempting tosurvive our time, so we may live intoyours. We hope someday, having solved theproblems we face, to join a community ofgalactic civilizations. This recordrepresents our hope and ourdetermination and our goodwill in a vastand awesome universe.\" Are these messagesenough?Should we send more? Well, why not sendeverything? We could, if we sent theLibrary of Babel.It's a website built by Jonathan Basilethat currently offers everything thathas been or could be written.Seriously. Divided into pages, it is builtto produce and locate on demand any 3200character combination of English lettersand the comma, space and period. Basilehas organized it all into hexagon-shapedrooms, each with four walls of bookscontaining five shelves with 32 volumesof four hundred and ten pages each.Everything's arranged in a pseudo-randomfashion, so browsing the online libraryfeels like a treasure hunt.Here's how it works.Each page is given a unique sequentialpage number in base 10. The text on eachpage is encased inside this number.An algorithm Basile created uses thepage number as a seed to generate aunique big number. That output is thenconverted into base 29 so that it can berepresented using every letter in theEnglish alphabet as well as the comma,the space and the period. This is whatyou see on the page. Basile has madesure that the algorithm will produceevery possible combination and the samepage number will create the same outputevery time.Which means that what is on each page isalready predetermined. So, in a way, everypage already exists.It only needs to be looked up.And here is the really mind blowingthing. The contents of a page can beconverted to base 10, sent through theinverted algorithm and turned into theexact page number they're found on. It's atruly eerie experience, because you canfind the permanent location for any 3200character text. You can find in thislibrary the description of your birth,every possible description of your death,every poem, every joke, every lie,anything that could be saidcan be found on this site.This thing blurs the line between inventionand discovery. Did you really discover or inventthat thing if its description already existed?10 to the 5,000 differentpagesare offered by the Library of Babel.In comparison, there are only 10 to the 80 atomsin the observable universe.I searched for what I've just said andsure enough in this hexagon, on this wall,this shelf and this volume on this page it'sthere.Hello.But deep down, we feel like there's adifference between this programpermuting something unknowingly anda person actually meaning it, intending it,saying it because they wanted to withagency. We use a finite number of symbolsto say things. For that reason, a library ofevery finite combination of thosesymbols can be made,but just because it can be madedoesn't need it has been said. That isthe power we have. Perhaps you and I wereborn too late to explore the world andtoo early in history to explore thestars, but we were born at just the righttime, which is pretty much all times everto explore language. To explore what can besaid. What should be said.What should we send out to space. What thatcan't be said will you be the first to say?And as always,thanks for watching.To watch the trailer of You, Me and the Apocalypseclick right up there andto see some other cool things YouTubershave done inspired by the series.

   "publishedAt": "26 Aug 2012",
   "transcription": "Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And what do yousay we get outta here...to space and intoan orbit. That way we could just float aroundand be free from the influence of gravity.Except not really.Astronauts orbiting around the Earth experiencepretty much the same gravitational pull thatyou and I are feeling right now. The majordifference is that those astronauts are falling,constantly, towards Earth, but their angularvelocity is so large that they're falling justas fast as Earth curves away from them. Now,of course, this is nothing New...ton's Cannonhasn't already taught us.Gravity makes stuff fall and, in particular,Newton realized that it makes objects acceleratetowards the Earth the same amount independentlyof how fast they're moving horizontally. That'scalled relativity. And, of course, orbitingis just falling, but falling where you movehorizontally fast enough that the earth fallsaway faster. In order to successfully falland miss the Earth, unless you dug a tunnel,you need to be travelling at over 17,000 mphor 8 km every second. So, you'd probablyincinerate from friction with the air, wellbefore you had a chance to enjoy the trip.Of course, Newton's thought experiment involvedthe Earth, but on something smaller, likethe Moon, the cannon wouldn't have to throwits projectile nearly as fast for it to completean orbit. In fact, if you had a powerful enoughgun on the Moon and you fired that gun atthe horizon and then waited a little bit,you could get hit in the back of the headby the same bullet.Henry calculated that the bullet would haveto travel about 1,600 m/s, which is exactlyhow fast the Paris gun fires.Now, that's a powerful gun, it's no squirtgun. But if you had a squirt gun, out therein space, and you fired a stream of waterat the Sun, how much water would it take toput out the Sun? I mean, in general, puttingwater on something hot would cause that somethinghot to lose some heat, especially since thewater will be frozen because it's out therein space. But, here's the issue. The Sun isnot a big ball of hydrogen on fire. Instead,the Sun is powered by fusion.Fusion of Hydrogen nuclei, which is kind oflike the chemical bonds between the Hydrogenand Oxygen that make up water, except on amuch smaller and much more powerful scale.Now, before I get tackled by nuclear physicistsfrom one side, and chemists from the other,let me explain.A bond of any sort, whether between planets,molecules, atoms, nuclei or quarks is justa happenstance where two or more particlestogether have a lower total energy than whenthey were apart. Like if you get marriedand your taxes go down. So, when you forma bond, that extra energy that the two solitaryparticles had is released, and because ofa little relation we called \"E=mc\u00b2,\" thisactually means that the mass of the pair goesdown a little bit too.For example, every fusion reactions turnsa little bit of Hydrogenous mass into light.Sunlight, for example, amounts to a loss of100 quadrillion kg each year. That's the equivalentof a medium sized asteroid. But stars havea lot of mass and the more massive a staris, the hotter it burns. And adding a bunchof water to the Sun would only cause it tobe more massive, so it would burn brighter,not go out. Of course, it would also burnfaster, which means that its life would be shorter.For instance, if you were to add 20 solarmasses of water to the Sun, you would decreaseits life expectancy from the current 5 billionyears to only a few hundred million more years.But there's a faster way to put out the Sun.Take that water, or whatever material youwant, and shoot it into the Sun in a way thatcauses everything to get spread out and scattered,so that there's no longer the critical densityneeded for fusion to occur. Now, no matterwhich avenue of putting out the Sun you pick,both would be a disaster. Literally, disaster.From \"Dis,\" meaning \"against,\" and \"aster\"meaning star, you would have literally turnedour own star against us.If you were somehow able to avoid that disasterby magically appearing in inter-galactic space,here's a fun experiment to try. Take out yourgun and fire a bullet. That bullet will beforever alone.That's because the universe is expanding,and if you were a few megaparsec's away fromthe nearest galactic cluster, on average thosegalaxies would be 200 km father away fromyou every passing second. In space terms,200 km per second is pretty slow. It's barelyas fast as the solar system orbits the centerof the Milky Way. And stars closer to thecenter of the galaxy can orbit 10 times faster.But a measly bullet travels only a few kmevery second and would have no chance of reachingthe receding galaxies, ever.It makes you realize how tiny we are comparedto the scale of the universe. But it alsomakes you realize how close together we allare here on Earth. Of course, to get fromone side of the Earth to the other, you haveto fly over half the sphere.So, what if instead there was a tunnel throughthe Earth? Let's jump over to my channel,Minute Physics, to see what happens.Click here and I'll see you on the other side.Oh, and as always,thanks for watching.",

   "title": "What If The Sun Disappeared?",
   "publishedAt": "31 Mar 2013",
   "transcription": "Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.Gravity is a property of matter, anythingwith mass. This includes the Moon, Earth,Jupiter, the Sun, and even you - your body.In fact, if you kinda like somebody, havethem stand 3/4 of a millimeter away from you.At that distance, cumulatively, every atomin your body and every atom in their bodywill draw you two together with the same gravitationalforce that the Sun is exerting on you right now.Of course, we don't feel either of those forcesbecause compared to the gravitational influenceof the Earth, they are basically nothing.You don't need to concern yourself with the gravitationalattraction between you and someone you'rehugging, or, your individual body and theSun, 150 million kilometres away.In fact, the Sun may as well not exist.What if the Sun disappeared?Well, to be sure, it's not going to happen.The Sun will die billions of years from nowby expanding, boiling off our oceansand swallowing the Earth whole.The Sun is not going to simply disappear.Matter and energy don't vanish. Of course,matter can quantum tunnel to different locations,but on the scale of the Sun there is notenough time in the lifetime of millions andbillions of universes for such a probabilityto even be worth discussing.But let's discuss it anyway, as a thoughtexperiment to determine how the Earth wouldget along with no Sun.What will the Earth do and what can it do alone?At the exact moment that the Sun disappeared,we would have no idea. Because it takes lightfrom the Sun 8 minutes and 20 seconds toreach Earth. So, for a little over 8 minutesafter the Sun disappeared, we would have noidea. Once we did, confusion and mass panicwould, most likely, ensue.The Sun's gravitational grasp on our planetwould also take 8 minutes and 20 seconds toend. This is because gravity waves propagateat the speed of light. So, the very momentwe saw our Sun disappear, we would also loseits gravitational influence and Earth wouldfly out in a straight line,tangent to wherever it was in its orbit.The finite speed of light and gravity meanthat as panic and fear spread across the Earthat the loss of our Sun, we could still, fora while, look up into the sky and see our planetarybuddies, further out, continuing to operateas if nothing had happened.For instance, Jupiter would continue orbitingand reflecting light from a Sun that no longerexisted for about 30 minutes after the Earthalready knew the Sun was gone. And, dependingon where Jupiter was in its orbit, it wouldtake another 30 minutes to an hour for usto watch the reflected light of Jupiter snuff out.With no moonlight or sunlight, the universeitself would be our only source of visiblelight from space.In 2004, Abdul Ahad calculated that the MilkyWay contributes about as much light as 1/300thof a full Moon. So there would be enough lightfrom space for us to see around a bit. But,of course, electricity and fossil fuels wouldstill be usable for a while. So, cities andtowns could continue to be lit by manmadesources, just like a typical night; except,it would be night everywhere.Photosynthesis would stop immediately, andthis is huge. I had a great discussion aboutthis video with Henry from MinutePhysics,and the new channel MinuteEarth. If you'renot subscribed to MinuteEarth, you definitely should be.In one of his episodes there, he mentionsthat 99.9% of the natural productivity onEarth is done by photosynthesis, which requiresthe Sun. Without the Sun, plants would nolonger be able to inhale carbon dioxide andexhale life-sustaining oxygen.But, don't worry. Collectively, all of ushumans, all 7 billion of us, breathe in about6 trillion kilos of oxygen every year.But our atmosphere contains a whopping quintillionkilos of oxygen. So, even without photosynthesis,and, including all the other animals, andinsects, and microorganisms that consume oxygen,it would take us thousands of years to runout.The poor plants themselves would be muchworse off. Without the Sun, most of them woulddie within days or weeks. Except for largeplants. Giants trees, for instance, containenough sugar for energy that they could technicallylive in the dark for years. Their problemis going to be that the Earth will get quitecold. In fact, mighty trees would freeze todeath. Their blood, the water and sap insideof them, solidify way before they died of starvation.Right now, with our Sun, the average surfacetemperature on Earth, hot places and coldplaces, and different seasons all considered,is an arguably comfortable 14 to 15 degreesCelsius.Without the Sun to add energy, the Earth wouldradiate away heat exponentially, meaningit would go fast at first and then happenmore and more slowly. By the end of the firstweek without the Sun, the average surfacetemperature across Earth would be freezing.Zero Celsius, 32 degrees Fahrenheit. Now, temperature's like this happen all the timeon Earth, we're used to it. Panic and fear and looters and anarchy aside, for the firstfew days or months, we could get by.But by the end of the first year withoutthe Sun, the average global surface temperaturewould be -73 degrees Celsius, -100 Fahrenheit.The best option, really, would be to moveto geothermal areas like Yellowstone or Iceland.These places would be the few safe havensfor human life after the Sun. Nearly all lifeon Earth exists because of, and is dependentupon, extraterrestrial energy: the Sun. Butthe Earth produces its own heat. Despite floatingin the coldness of space for billions of years,down below the crust the Earth is quite warm.20% of this warmth came from the fact thatwhen the Earth formed, mass crushed so tightlyin the middle that the pressure liquified rock.The other 80% of Earth's internal heatcomes from that fact that deep in its core,radioactive elements decay, providing theenergy needed to keep the Earth's core at5,000 degrees Celsius.Anyone who failed to secure a position withinone of these bastions of warmth, or, perhaps,underground in a community warmed and poweredby nuclear fuel, would likely be dead withinthe first year of no Sun.In the next 10 or 20 years things would startto get wet with dew. But not with gloriouswater droplets. Instead, droplets of liquid air.The air would literally become cold enoughfor the gasses that make it up to condense,or form clouds and precipitate, first as rain,and then as it got colder and colder,eventually, as snow.In Fritz Leiber's famous science-fiction shortstory \"A Pail of Air,\" this has already happened.The Earth was ripped away from the Sun, and,in order to survive, a family must go outdoorsin a special suit and scoop up a pale of justthe oxygen snow, bring it back in, and placeit over a fire to warm and allow them to breathe.A year or so after the sun disappeared, Earth'soceans will have frozen over. Ice all theway across. But ice is less dense than liquidwater, which means that ice floats. And iceis a pretty decent insulator.So, for billions of years after the Sun disappeared, liquidwater could still exist at the bottom of ouroceans, protected and insulated from spaceby miles of ice above it, and warmed by ventson the ocean floor that spew water out, superheated by Earth's interior.This would continue on Earth for a very, verylong time - Sun or no Sun. Instead of becomingfrozen and lifeless, extremophiles, like microbes,that live around hydrothermal vents deep inthe ocean, would be fine. They live deep inthe ocean, far below the point where sunlightcan penetrate, and they make energy not throughphotosynthesis, but via chemosynthesis - convertingheat and methane and sulphur into the energythey need. They are then eaten by clams andtubeworms.Extremophiles deposit minerals back into thevents, meaning that their food chain is complete.It's a circle. It's independent of the Sun.Earthlings like them would thrive if the Sunwere to disappear. They would live just finewithout every knowing that the Sun was gone.Or, honestly, without ever even knowing itexisted in the first place.It's amazing to think that life, here on Earth,all alone, flying through space with no Sun,would kind of be fine. Far from becoming afrozen dead rock, or a boring dormant seed,the Earth would be a spaceship, carrying livingpassengers with enough geothermal heat forbillions of years of life.If the Sun disappeared, spaceship Earth wouldfly out in a straight line covering about30 kilometres every single second. After just 1 billionyears, it will have covered 900 quadrillionkilometres or about 100,000 lightyears - a trip thatcould potentially take it all the way acrossour galaxy, near thousands of stars.And nothing's to say it couldn't fall into orbit around one,thaw out, and allow its still-living extremophilesto proliferate life on Earth all over again;maybe one day developing life intelligentenough to uncover whatever is left of ourlives.Maybe they could even find this very video.In which case, hi, uh, you're welcomefor this video about your planet's history and journey.And, um, as always, thanks for watching.",

   "title": "How Big Can a Person Get?",
   "publishedAt": "15 Apr 2013",
   "transcription": "Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.Tencentimeters - about four inches.Thisis how much taller on average peopleare today than they were 150years ago.Better nutrition and medical careearly in life has allowed us to bettertake advantage of the blueprintswithin our genes.Blueprints that carry plans for just howbig a healthy human being can get givenan optimal environment.In terms of height, those plansrarely exceed 7 feet 6 inches.But individuals with endocrine disorders,for instance a tumour,near the pituitary gland in the braincan experience growth that occurs morerapidly and for a longer period of timethan usual.For instance, Igor Vovkovinskiy,who at 7 foot 8 inches is thetallest man currently livingin America.The tallest living person anywhere on Earthis Sultan K\u00f6sen, who at 8 foot 3 inches tallalso holds the Guinness world record for largest handsand feet.But the tallest personever officially recorded was Robert Wadlow.He was the size of an average adult malewhen he enteredkindergarten at the age of 5.When he diedin 1940 at the age of 22, he was8 foot 11 inches tall.Andre the Giantwas 7' 4\".And thisis me holding a 12-ounce can.Here's Andre doing the same.Human size variationis fascinating, but what's the maximum, biologicallyhow big can a human get?And more importantly,how big are you really?It turns out that today, nowin history, average human heightis probably quite near the geneticlimit.By manipulating the very genes responsible for height,we may be able to add an extra 15centimeters or so to thataverage, but beyond that we are likely to hita ceiling.In order to regularly producepeople over 8 feet tall, 2.44 meters,those people would probably need to bea different shape.Not human shaped.This is because of the square-cube law.As a shape grows, say, taller,its volume increases at a greater rate.Take a look at this cube.If we make it 10 times larger,well, sure, it's 10 times as tall,but the area covered by its facesis 100 times larger and its volume,the space within it, is 1000 times larger.Now, since weight is connected to volume, this cubeonly has one hundred times thecross-sectional area to support itself,but one thousand times the weight to support.So, if you were ten times larger,and still shaped like a person, that isyour proportions were the same as theyare now,you would need to either have a skeletonmade out of something stronger than boneor bones that were monstrously thick,like way out of proportion.But even if you solved the bone andmuscle strength problem,there would still be a whole host ofother issues. For instance, your heartwouldn't scale up fast enough tokeep blood pumping throughout a bodythat large.Animals can get that big,because their proportionsand organs are quite different.Chris Howard from Earth Unplugged tipped me off to thegiant, not human proportioned, legsof the largest land animal ever known tohave existed withthe certainty of a complete skeleton,the awesomely named giraffatitan.Discovered in Tanzania and now mountedin Berlin's Humboldt museumit probably weighed 20 to 30 thousand kilograms.The Bruhathkayosaurus may have been even larger,but this is controversial because weonly have a few of its bones.Estimates put this guy at 140,000kilograms.Any larger than that,and in order to survive long enough to reproduce,an animal would need more buoyancy tocounteract its weightthan air can provide.This is one of the reasonsblue whales love the water so much.The heaviest blue whale ever measured by NMMLweighed in at 177,000 kilograms,making it the heaviest animal we are aware ofthat has ever existed.It might be the heaviestpossible, because animal size is limitedby simple geometryand the gravity of our planet.Theoretically, humans born on Mars couldgrow a few inches taller,because gravity there is only one thirdof what it is on earth.The trade off of course being that theirbones and muscles wouldn't grow strongenoughfor them to ever visit Earth andenjoy it. The point is, in order to havethe same shape and proportions that wehave now,we can't really get that much bigger.Some of the higher estimates of the upperlimit upaverage human height are around 7 feet tall.A person who is more than 9 feettall would struggle to move around.aAd up in the 12- to 15-foot range, it would bedifficult to live very long at all.But what does size mean?Where do you really beginand end?So far we have been measuring people usingtheir rigid boundaries.It's a good one to use,it's very common, but of course, when I speakI can fill an entire room and when I shoutI can fill city blocks.That'shuge.Of course, my voice is not a part of my physical body.It's not part of the matter that fitswithin my skin container.But it's relevant to the question of how biga person is.How large of animpact on their environment can a personhave using what comes directlyfrom their bodies?Well, Guy Murchie illustrated this quite wellin his tome \"The Seven Mysteries of Life.\"The little solid dogs are small,but their sound and smell extend intoshapes and sizes no creature could evendreamof filling up with their bodies on earth.Let's begin with sound.How farcan your loudest shout travel?How much bigger are you?The volume of space within which peopleare aware that you existwhen you shout.Well, the loudest shout a human can make is about88 decibels from 30 centimeters away.A shout like that will die out down belowthe threshold of human hearingin our atmosphere, after traveling about 5kilometres or 3 miles.A person standing downwind from youmight be able to make you out a littlefurther than that,but the point is, in space no onecan hear you scream.And on earth, from 5 kilometres away,no one can hear you scream.But could they see you scream?Really, could they see youat all?Well, on the surface of the earth,the furthest you can see another person isthe horizon.If you and another person are standing on the ground,that distance is about 5 kilometersor 3 miles. Any further away than thatand you will literally be hidingbehind the curvature of the earth.So what aboutin, say, outer space, where moving awayfrom another person doesn't meaneventually hiding behind the earth.Well, as an object moves farther and farther away,it becomes smaller and smaller.Of course, theactual size of the object doesn't change.What does change to youis its angular size.This brilliant measurement describes how muchspace in your visual field an object takes up.Imagine your visual field as a completecircle, 180 degrees of which go from thehorizon in front of youto the horizon behind you.So, an object with an angular sizeof 90 degrees would have to be big enoughand close enough, so as to take up allthe space from the horizonto right above you.Interestingly, yourthumb held at an arm's length away from your facetakes up about one degree of your visual field.Its sizeis 1 degree.The Moon takes up abouthalf a degree at all times.It sometimes appearslarger at the horizon, but that's becauseof an illusion that AsapSCIENCEcoveredreally well. Te smallest angular size we can see with the naked eyeis about one arc minute, a sixtiethof a degree. But given enough contrast,we can see things like Sunspots,a mere 20 arc seconds across,a third of a sixtieth of a degree.Plugging in numbers to do the mathwill tell us that with perfect conditions:outer space, no air, no obstructions,a lot of contrast, because you are wearingbright white, the farthest awaya person could see you with their nakedeye would be about10 to 15 kilometres.Any further away than that and they willhave passed the edgeof your naked eye visibility existence.But... do you smell that?It might beyou.If we consider the senses of other animals,your smell, your scent, might be yourlargest earthly dimension.You know how animals like cats and dogshave those cute littlewet noses?It's calleda rhinarium.Rhinariums allow mammals to smellreally really well.They don't just pick up molecules that float by,they localize them.Air cools the wet nose,allowing the animal to tell the source of the smell.It's the same as when you wet yourfinger and stick it in the air to tellthe wind's direction.A Bloodhound can pick up and trace to youa scent trail that is days old,making your scent imprint on the earthabout as large as you can move in a couple days.But the Silvertip grizzly has a sense of smell that isseven times stronger that a Bloodhound.These guys can smell things from 18 miles away,nearly 30 kilometres.That's probablythe largest bubble we could draw around youand still call you, because it containsthings that you omitted that can betraced back to you by other livingthings.But if we include everything you emit,well, fundamentally we're limited to the edges of earth'satmosphere,because with the exception of a few light molecules,hydrogen, helium, which escape into space,not much else leaves. There's no medium inspace for your sound and smells totravel through.Which brings us back to light.The human body emits light,electromagnetic radiation.Most of it is infrared light,heat.But some of it lies within the visible spectrum,though it's about 1,000 times dimmer thanthe dimmest lightthe eye can see.It seems that what little visible light youdo emit is tied in some way to your circadian rhythms,meaning that around 4 p.m. everyday,you are literally visibly the brightestyou will be all day.But here's the thing about light, aboutelectromagnetic radiation.It doesn't need a medium to travel through. It justkeeps goingout into and through space,which of course brings us to Australia.If you're not subscribed to Derek's channel VeritasiumI don't know what you're doing with your life.It is amazingand he recently made a video that I havenot been able to stop thinking about.The smallest possible piece of lightis a photon and the human eye cankind of perceive individual photons,a bit better than chance.But some frogs can see individualphotons quite well.Now, in his video he explains that,as you move away from the Sun,its angular size gets smaller andsmaller and smaller, until eventuallyyou're so far away from the Sun that youcan no longer see it.But it's still there and it is still emitting lightthat can reach your eye, except nowthat light has been spread so thinit's not big packets of light you cansee,it's just individual photons.The Sun is still there, it's just less frequent.Sometimes a photon hits your eye,sometimes nothing and sometimes a photon again.Well, the same thing happens to radiation emittedby you.I Skyped with Derek this afternoonand he calculated that the human body,seen at a distance of 168,000 kilometreswould also be reduced to merelya few individual photons.Further than that and your size wouldno longer get smaller, it would justremain individual photons flying through space,they are, after all, indivisible.So,your physical size is limited by geometryand biology and gravity.Yourvocal and fragrant size can be biggerbut it still limited by the size of Earth.But your light, your personalglow, isn't really bounded by anything.The photons that you are emitting rightnow, the ones that don't get absorbed byanything,have no reason to ever really stop.And they can continue conceivably pasteven the observableuniverse, making you,in a way, completely hugeand kind of immortal.And as always,thanks for watching.",

itprobably won't go away altogether it'stoo useful but the words we don't likewill likely change history has shownthat as disease becomes less scary andsex and the supernatural more personalwords related to them become less tabooand more commonwhereas words that were common in thepast are increasingly unpleasant perhapsin the future spurt not by runawaypolitical correctness but by

   "transcription": "hey Vsauce Michael here what is thebiggest number you can think of a Googlea googolplex a milli million all Plexwell in reality the biggest number is 40covering more than 12,000 square metersof Earth this 40 made out ofstrategically planted trees in Russia islarger than the battalion markers onSignal Hill in Calgary the six found onthe above and badges in England even themile of pieBrady unrolled on numberphile 40 is thebiggest number on earth in terms ofsurface area but in terms of amount ofthings which is normally what we mean bya number view big 40 probably isn't thebiggest for example there's 41 now andthen there's 42 and 43 a billion atrillion you know no matter how big of anumber you can think of you could alwaysgo higher so there is no biggest lastnumber except infinityinfinity is not a number instead it's akind of number you need infinite numbersto talk about and compare amounts thatare unending but some unending amountssome infinities are literally biggerthan others let's visit some of them andcount past themfirst things first when a number refersto how many things there are it iscalleda cardinal number for example forbananas twelve flags twenty dots twentyis the cardinality of this set of dotsnow two sets have the same cardinalitywhen they contain the same number ofthings we can demonstrate this equalityby pairing each member of one setone-to-one with each member of the othersame cardinality pretty simple we usethe natural numbers that is 0 1 2 3 4 5and so on as Cardinals whenever we talkabout how many things there are but howmany natural numbers are thereit can't be some number in the naturalsbecause there'd always be one plus thatnumber after it instead there's a uniquenamed for this amount aleph-null Alephis the first letter of the Hebrewalphabet and Aleph null is the firstsmallest infinity it's how many naturalnumbers there are it's also how manyeven numbers there are how many oddnumbers there are it's also how manyrational numbers that is fractions thereare that may sound surprising sincefractions appear more numerous on thenumber linebut as Cantor showed there's a way toarrange every single possible rationalsuch that the naturals can be put into aone-to-one correspondence withthey have the same Cardinale point isaleph-nullis a big amount bigger than any finiteamount a googol a googolplex agoogolplex factorial ^ a googolplex - agoogolplex squared times Graham's numberAleph Nolan is biggerbut we can count past it nowwell let's use our old friend the supertask if we draw a bunch of lines andmake each next line a fraction of thesize and a fraction of the distance fromeach last line well we can fit anunending number of lines into a finitespace the number of lines here is equalto the number of natural numbers thatthere are the two can be matched one twoonethere's always a next natural butthere's also always a next line bothsets have the cardinality aleph-nullbut what happens when I do this now howmany lines are there aleph-nullplus one no unending amounts aren't likefinite amounts there are still onlyaleph-null lines here because I canmatch the naturals one-to-one just likebefore I just start here and thencontinue from the beginning clearly theamount of lines hasn't changed I caneven add two more lines three more fourmore I always end up with onlyaleph-null things I can even add anotherinfinite aleph-null of lines and stillnot change the quantity every evennumber can pair with these in every oddnumber with these there is still a linefor every natural another cool way tosee that these lines don't add to thetotal is to show that you can make thissame sequence without drawing new linesat all just take every other line andmove them all together to the end it'sthe same thingwhat hold on a second this and this mayhave the same number of things in thembut clearly there's something differentabout them right I mean if it's not howmany things they're made of what is itwell let's go back to having just oneline after an Aleph null sizedcollection what if instead of matchingthe Naturals one to one we insist onnumbering each line according to theorder it was drawn in so we have tostart here and number left to right nowwhat number does this line get in therealm of the infinite labeling things inorder is pretty different than countingthem you see this line doesn'tcontribute to the total but in order tolabel it according to the order itappeared in well we need a set of labelsof numbers that extends past thenaturalswe need ordinal numbers the first transby night ordinal is omega the lowercaseGreek letter Omega this isn't a joke ora trick it's literally just the nextlabel you'll need after using up theinfinite collection of every singlecounting number first if you got omega'the place in a race that would meanthat an infinite number of peoplefinished the race and then you did afterOmega comes Omega plus 1 which doesn'treally look like a number but it is justlike 2 or 12 or 800 then comes Omegaplus 2 Omega plus 3 ordinal numberslabel things in order ordinals aren'tabout how many things there are insteadthey tell us how those things arearranged their order type the order typeof a set is just the first ordinalnumber not needed to label everything inthe set in order so for finite numberscardinality and order typethe same the order type of all thenaturals is Omega the order type of thissequence is Omega plus 1 and now it'sOmega plus 2 no matter how long anarrangement becomes as long as its wellordered as long as every part of itcontains a beginning element the wholething describes a new ordinal numberalways this will be very important lateron it should be noted at this point thatif you are ever playing a game of whocan name the biggest number and you'reconsidering Sain Omega plus 1 you shouldbe careful your opponents might requirethe number of you name to be a cardinalthat refers to an amount these numbersrefer to the same amount of stuff justarranged differently Omega plus 1 isn'tbigger than Omega it just comes afterOmega but aleph-nullisn't the end why well because it can beshown that there are infinities biggerthan aleph-nullbut literally contain more things one ofthe best ways to do this is withCantor's diagonal argument in my episodeon the Banach tarski paradox I used itto show that the number of real numbersis larger than the number of naturalnumbers but for the purposes of thisvideo let's focus on another thingbigger than Aleph null the power set ofa littlethe power set of a set is the set of allthe different subsets you can make fromfor example from the set of 1 & 2 I canmake a set of nothing or 1 or 2 or 1 & 2the power set of 1 2 3 is the empty set1 & 2 & 3 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 1 23 as you can see a power set containsmany more members than the original setto ^ however many members the originalset had to be exact so what's the powerset of all the Naturals well let's seeimagine a list of every natural numbercool now the subset of all say evennumbers would look like this yes no yesno yes no and so on the subset of allodd numbers would look like thishere's the subset of just 3 7 and 12 andhow about every number except 5 or nonumber except 5 obviously this list ofsubsets is going to be well infinite butimagine matching them all one to onewith a natural if even then there's away to keep producing new subsets thatare clearly not listed anywhere here wewill know that we've got a set with moremembers than there are natural numbers abigger infinity than aleph-null the wayto do this is to start up here in thefirst subset and just do the opposite ofwhat we see 0 is a member of this one soour new set will not contain 0 next movediagonally down to ones membership inthe second subsetone is a member of it so it will not bein our new one two is not in the thirdsubset so it will be in ours and so onas you can see we are describing asubset that will be by definitiondifferent in at least one way from everysingle other subset on this aleph-nullsized list even if we put this newsubset back in diagonalization can stillbe done the power set of the naturalswill always resist a one-to-onecorrespondence with the naturals it's aninfinity bigger than aleph-nullrepeated applications of power set willproduce sets that can't be put intoone-to-one correspondence with the lastso it's a great way to quickly producebigger and bigger infinities the pointis there are more Cardinals afteraleph-nulllet's try to reach them now rememberthat after Omega ordinals split andthese numbers are no longer Cardinalsthey don't refer to a greater amountthan the last Cardinal we reached butmaybe they can take us to one wait whatare we doing Aleph null Omega come onwe've been using these numbers likethere's no problem but if at any pointdown here you can always add one alwayscan we really talk about it this endlessprocess as a totality and then follow itwith somethingof course we can this is math notscience the things we assume to be truein math are called axioms and an axiomwe come up with isn't more likely to betrue if it better explains or predictswhat we observe instead it's truebecause we say it is its consequencesjust become what we observe we are notfitting our theories to some physicaluniverse whose behavior and underlyinglaws would be the same whether we werehere or not we are creating thisuniverse ourselves if the axioms wedeclare to be true lead us tocontradictions or paradoxes we can goback and tweak them or just abandon themall together or we can just refuse toallow ourselves to do the things thatcause the paradoxes that's it what'sfascinating though is that in makingsure the axioms we accept don't lead toproblems we've made math into somethingthat is as the saying goes unreasonablyeffective in the Natural Sciences so towhat extent were inventing all of thisor discovering it it's hard to say allwe have to do to get Omega is say letthere be Omega and it will be goodthat's what Ernest Zermelo did in 1908when he included the axiom of infinityin his list of axioms for doing stuff inmath the axiom of infinity is simply thedeclaration that one infinite set existsthe set of all natural numbers if yourefuse to accept it that's fine thatmakes you a finite list one who believesonly finite things existbut if you accept it as mostmathematicians do you can go pretty farpast bees and through these eventuallywe get to Omega plus Omega except wereached another ceiling going all theway out to Omega plus Omega would be tocreate another infinite set and theaxiom of infinity only guarantees thatthis one exists are we going to have toadd a new axiom every time we describeout of no more numbers no the axiom ofreplacement can help us herethis assumption states that if you takea set like say the set of all naturalnumbers and replace each element withsomething else like say bananas whatyou're left with is also a set thatsounds simple but it's incredibly usefultry this take every ordinal up to Omegaand then instead of bananas put Omegaplus in front of each now we've reachedOmega plus Omega or Omega times to usingreplacement we can make jumps of anysize we want so long as we only usenumbers we've already achieved we canreplace every ordinal up to Omega withOmega times it to reach Omega timesOmega Omega squaredwe're cooking now the axiom ofreplacement allows us to construct newordinals without end eventually we getto Omega to the Omega to the Omega tothe Omega to Omega and we run out ofstandard mathematical notationno problem this is just called epsilonnot and we continue from here but nowthink about all of these ordinals allthe different ways to arrange a lovenull things well these are well orderedso they have an order type some ordinalthat comes after all of them in thiscase that ordinal is called Omega onenow because by definition Omega onecomes after every single order type ofElath null things it must describe anarrangement of literally more stuff thanthe last Aleph I mean if it didn't itwould be somewhere in here but it's notthe Cardinal number describing theamount of things used to make anarrangement with order type Omega 1 isAleph 1 it's not known where the powerset of the naturals falls on this lineit can't be between these Cardinalsbecause well there aren't Cardinalsbetween them it could be equal to aloved one that belief is called thecontinuum hypothesis but it could alsobe larger we just don't know thecontinuum hypothesis by the way isprobably the greatest unansweredquestion in this entire subject andtoday in this videoI will not be solving it but I will begoing higher and higher to bigger andbigger infinities now using thereplacement axiom we can take anyordinal we've already reached like sayOmega and jump from Aleph to Aleph allthe way out to a love Omega or pick whynot use a bigger ordinal like Omegasquare to construct Aleph Omega squaredAleph Omega Omega Omega Omega OmegaOmega M in our notation only allows meto add countably many omegas here butreplacement doesn't care about whetheror not I have a way to rank the numbersit reaches wherever I land will be aplace of even bigger numbers allowing meto make even bigger and more numerousjumps than before the whole thing is awildly accelerating feedback loop ofimbibing we can keep going like thisreaching bigger and bigger infinitiesfrom below replacement and repeatedpower sets which may or may not line upwith the ellipse can keep our climbgoing forever so clearly there's nothingbeyond themright not so fast that's what we saidabout getting past the finite to Omegawhy not accept as an axiom that thereexists some next number so big no amountof replacement or power setting onanything smaller could ever get you nowsuch a number is called an inaccessiblecardinal because you can't reach it frombelow now interestingly within thenumbers we've already reached a shadowof such a number can be found Aleph nullyou can't reach this number from beloweither all numbers less than it arefinite and a finite number of finitenumbers can't be added multipliedexponentiate 'add replaced with finitejumps a finite number of times or evenpower set a finite number of times togive you anything but another finiteamount sure the power set of a millimillion to a googolplex to a googolplexto a googolplex is really big but it'sstill just finite not even close toAleph null the first smallest infinityfor this reason Aleph null is oftenconsidered an inaccessible number someauthors don't do this though saying aninaccessible must also be uncountablewhich okay makes sense I mean we'vealready accessed Aleph null but rememberthe only way we could is by straight-updeclaring its existence axiomatically wewill have to do the same forinaccessible Cardinals it's really hardto get acrossjust how unfathomable the size of aninaccessible Cardinal is I'll just leaveit at this the conceptual junk fromnothing to the first infinity is likethe jump from the first infinity to aninaccessibleset theorists have described numbersbigger than inaccessible x' each onerequiring a new large cardinal axiomasserting its existence expanding theheight of our universe of numbers willthere ever come a point where we devisean axiom implying the existence of somany things that it impliescontradictory things will we somedayanswer the Continuum Hypothesis maybenot but there are promising directionsand until then the amazing fact remainsthat many of these infinities perhapsall of them are so big it's not exactlyclear whether they even truly exist orcould be shown to in the physicaluniverse if they do if one day physicsfinds a use for them that's great but ifnot that's great too that would meanthat we have with this brain a tinything a cept Elian times smaller thanthe tiny planet it lives on discoveredsomething true outside of the physicalrealm something that applies to the realworld but is also strong enough to gofurther past what even the universeitself can contain or show us or be andas always thanks for watchinganother interesting fact abouttransfinite ordinals is that arithmeticwith them is a little bit differentnormally two plus one is the same as oneplus two but Omega plus one is not thesame as one plus Omega 1 plus Omega isactually just omega think about them asorder types one thing placed beforeOmega just uses up all the naturals andleaves us with order type Omega onething placed after Omega requires everynatural number and then Omega leaving uswith Omega plus 1 as the order type",

   "title": "What If The Earth Stopped Spinning?",
   "publishedAt": "16 Jun 2014",
   "transcription": "Hey, Vsauce. Michael Here. The Earth is spinningand we are spinning along with it. But what if theEarth suddenly stopped spinning? Well first of all, you wouldgain weight. But that would be the leastof your worries. The spin of our planet is importantand literally giving you the time of your life.At the equator, the surface of Earth, andeverything on it, is spinning around at 465 metres a second.As you move closer to the poles you don't have to move as quickly to completeEarth's daily rotation. Here in San Francisco, the Earth is driving meeast at 368 metres per second. If I could float above the surfaceindependent of the Earth's rotation, the Earth would spin underneath methis quickly. Pretty cool. But, of course, when I jump straight up into the air,the Earth doesn't move underneath me because I continued to spin with it.We are all spinning with the Earth and that is why slamming on a set ofmagical planetary breaks that caused everythingclassically called Earth to stop spinning would be catastrophic.Immediately everything that wasn'tEarth, and wasn't safely at the poles, would continue moving, as it had been,and be flung due east at more than a thousand miles an hourYou wouldn't be flung into space because escape velocity is 24,800 mph (39911.731 km/h)but your body wouldinstantly become a 9.5 inch calibre bullet.Well, really more of a supersonic tumbleweed.Because the atmosphere would more gradually slow down, people in airplanesassuming they could navigate the resulting storms, might have a betterchance of surviving.Astronauts aboard the ISS would fare even better.But it is unlikely that anyone would be waiting for themdown on the ground. Runways would just beentrances to the new planet-sized graveyard,created by the no longer spinning EarthPeople really really near the poles might be okay butonly at first. Gusts of wind, as fast as those near an atomic bomb detonation,would blast, pass the surface and up into the sky forming worldwide stormsof unprecedented magnitude. The friction alone,caused by the now stopped Earth colliding with these winds, would be enough to causemassive fires,unparalleled erosion and damage to anything strong enough to stay putafter the initial braking. The Sun would seem to freeze in the sky as daysbecame not 24 hours long but 365 days long.Without spinning innards, Earth's protective magnetic field would cease to existand we would be dosed with deadly amounts of ionising radiation from the Sun.The oceans would surge onto land in tsunamis kilometers high and wash over nearlyall dry land, before migrating to the poles,where gravity is stronger, no longer held to the ocean basins by the inertiaEarth's spin gave them,until Earth itself, no longer bulging an extra 42 kilometers around its equator, becauseof its rotationslowly compressed into a more perfect spherethan it is now. Possibly allowing the oceans to eventually return somewhat.That is what would occurif it actually happened. It won't actually happen butwoah, its rotation is slowing down.More on that later. First, if the Earth really is spinning so quickly,why can't we feel it? Why doesn't the Earth's rotationmake us dizzy? Well, lucky for us,the change in velocity is just too gradual. The Earth is too huge.It's like driving in a car that takes6 hours and six thousand miles to make oneleft turn. It's not sudden enough to registerwith our senses. But that change in velocityis real and it makes us weighless, because of inertia. On our spinning planet your velocity is constantlychanging but alwaystangential to the circular path you were being dragged along.Now, because inertia is a property of matter, which includesyour body, without a force acting upon us we wouldslowly leave the surface of Earth.Luckily, the Earth is exerting a force on us. A centre-seeking,centripetal force, delivered by gravity.The centripetal force required to keep you along a circular path with Earth is subtractedfrom Earth's total gravitational pull on you.The remaining force simply pushes you down,toward the centre of the Earth - it gives you weight.At the equator, if the Earth didn't spin, and no centripetal force was required tokeep youwith the Earth, you would weigh 0.3 percentmore than you currently do. If Earth spun you around17 times faster than it currently does, all of its gravitational forcewould go toward centripetal force fighting against your inertiaand you would be weightless.So here's a diet idea. Hope that the Earth startsspinning faster and go back for guilt-free seconds.Seconds.We know exactly how longa second is. The outermost electronof an atom of cesium 133 is aloneWhen the atom is undisturbed, only the nucleusinteracts with this outermost electron, tickling itregularly and rapidly between two levels.After 9,192,631,770oscillations between those two levels, one second has passed.Exactly.That is literally the definition of a second.We can measure and count those oscillations.It's how atomic clocks work. Making atomic clocks,the most accurate measurement device ever built by humans, to measure anything.We can't definea second more simply, as say, 1/60th of 1/60th of 1/24th of a daybecause of Earth's spin.It's too irregular. Little changesin the distribution of mass on Earth, caused by earthquakes or melting iceor man-made dams or technicallyeven you walking up stairs or downstairs,cause Earth's rotational speed to change.Like a figure skater moving their arms further away from or closer to their bodies.Now add on top of that the fact that tides, caused by the Moon,drag against Earth's rotation and you wind up with anunstable rotation speed that ispredominately slowing down.Now, these changes are incredibly incredibly slight, but over timethey add up. In 140 million years,a day on earth will not be 24 hours long,it will be 25. That might not sound like muchbut in order to do important things, like deliver accurate GPS information,we need a more accurate timekeeping devicethan that. So, as a solutionscientists keep the pace of seconds using atomic clocks,TAI time. And other scientistsmeasure the changing speed of Earth's rotation by observing distant starsand quasars. Now, every few months they find out just how behind or aheadEarth is running, and if it's getting too close to being a secondoff, they decide to add or subtract the second from the current year.The result is the time used almost everywhere,including your phone: UTCSince this system began in 197225 leap seconds have been added.What this means is that clock time is,and has to be, a manufacturedproduct with upgrades and tune ups administeredperiodically, after defectsare noticed. The time we give to nowand the future is only everapproximate. That's weirdbut it's also entirely not weirdAs Demetrios Matsakis, the Chief Scientist of Time Services for the USNaval Observatory puts it,\"we save livesand we end lives. We add time and we can take time away,but in both cases we do so without completelyunderstanding exactly what life is,or what time is.\"Regardless, thank you for spending some of yours with me...And as always,thanks for watching.",

2,000 people disappear and arenever found again dead or alivewhere do missing people go how do theydisappear what if you disappeared andhow do you know you haven't alreadydisappeared in many cases missingpersons are the victims of unsolved orunknown crimes they may have sufferedaccidents or taken their own lives andtheir bodiesare never found or they may be perfectlyfine and have simply escaped their oldlife old friends and family old debt andobligations to start a new lifesomewhere else possibly as someone elsehow long would it take for people tonotice if you disappeared hmm well thinkabout it I mean it sort of depends onwho you are how you live and how youdisappeared in most jurisdictions afterabout five to seven years if no one hasheard anything from you at all you canbe declared dead in absentia this iswhat happened to French astronomerGuillaume Liu Zhang T in the 18thcentury hundreds of people travelled farand wide to observe the transit of Venusfrom different locations on earth theyknew that by comparing theirmeasurements they could calculate moreaccurately than ever beforejust how far away the Sun was so LouJean T left Paris in 1764 Pondicherry inIndia but after a storm blew him offcourse and the British occupiedPondicherry he was forced to spend theday of the transit on a boat at seawhich rocked too much for accuratemeasurements to be taken now the nexttransit would happen in 8 years butafter that the next next transitwouldn't happen for another hundredyears so he stuck around he didn'treturn to Paris instead he built anobservatory and waited when he finallyreturned to Paris eleven years afterleaving he found that he had beendeclared dead his wife had remarried hisfamily had plundered his belongings andhis position at the Royal Academy ofSciences had been given to someone elsehe never did see the transit of Venus bythe way on the day that it happened thesky above him was overcastwe know the human population of Earthkind of population figures

powerful articles i've ever readthere is a lot of information out therethere's even a word for itinfo bee city it takes a lifetime toeven experience some of it it's easy tothink that everyone knows everythingthat you know but every year more than100 million new people are born and nota single one of them is born knowingthat they are made out of atoms or thatblack holes are awesome someone needs tobe there to tell them to show them howmany jokes do you hear every day everyweek how many jokes do you hear everyyear here's a fun thought by consideringaverage life expectancy and the typicalnumber of jokes a person hears in a yearDavid Wong posited a thought ruff in itsapproximation but sharp in its essenceif you are under the age of thirty eightodds are the funniest joke you will everhear is a joke you haven't even heardyet and if you are over the age ofthirty eight odds are you already know ajoke that to more people than you couldever possibly meet might be the funniestjoke they will ever hear so wherever youwe're glad you're there and as alwaysthanks for watching",

   "title": "Is Anything Real?",
   "publishedAt": "03 Jun 2013",
   "transcription": "Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.Where are your fingers?Seriously. It's a pretty easy question.You should be able to answer it.But how do you know?How doesanyone know anything? You might say, well,I know where my fingers are. I'm lookingright at them.Or, I can touch them, I can feel them, they'reright here and that's good.Your senses are a great way to learn things.In fact, we have way more than the usualfive senses we talk about.For instance, your kinesthetic sense, proprioception.This is what the police evaluateduring a field sobriety test.It allows you to tell where your fingersand arms and head and legs in your bodyis all in relation to each otherwithout having to look or touch other things.We have way more than five senses, wehave at least twice as manyand then some. But they're not perfect.There are optical illusions,audio illusions,temperature sensation illusions, even tactileillusions.Can you turn your tongue upside down?If so, perfect. Try this.Run your fingeralong the outer edge of the tip of your upside downtongue. Your tongue will be able to feel your finger, but in the wrong place.Our brains never needed to develop an understandingof upside down tongue touch.So, when you touch the right side of your tonguewhen it's flipped over to your left sideyou perceive a sensationon the opposite side, where your tongue usually is but isn'twhen it's upside down.It's pretty freaky and cooland a little humbling,because it shows the limits of theaccuracy of our senses, the only tools wehave to get what's out therein here.The philosophy of knowledge,the study of knowing, is called Epistomology.Plato famously said that the things we knoware things that are true, that we believeand that we have justification for believing.those justifications might beirrationalor they might be rational, they might be based on proof,but don't get too confident becauseproven is not a synonymfor true. Luckily, there are things that we can knowwithout needing proof, without needing toeven leave the house, things that we canknow as trueby reason alone.These are things that we knowa priori.An example would be the statement\"all bachelors are unmarried.\"I don't have to go surveyevery bachelor on earth to know that that is true.All bachelors are unmarriedbecause that's how we definethe word bachelor. Of course, you have to know what the wordsbachelor and unmarried mean in the first place.Oh, you do? Okay. Perfect. That's great.Buthow do you know?This time I meanfunctionally, how do you know?Where is knowledge biologicallyin the brain?What are memories made out of?We are a long way from being able toanswer that question completelybut research has shown that memoriesdon't exist in the brain in singlelocations.Instead, what we calla memory is likely made up of manydifferent complex relationships all overthe brain between lots of brain cells,neurones. A major cellular mechanismthought to underlie the formation ofmemoriesis long-term potentiation orLTP.When one neurone stimulates another neuronerepeatedly that signal can be enhanced overtimeLTP, wiring them more strongly togetherand that connection can last a long time, evenan entire lifetime.A collection of different brain cells,neurones that fire together in a particular orderover and over again frequently and repeatedlycan achieve long-term potentiation, becomingmore sensitive to each other and moreready to fire in the exact same waylater on in the future.They're a physical thingin your brain, firing together more easilybecause you strengthen that pattern of firing.You memorized.This branching forest of firing friendslooks messy, but look closer.It could be the memoryof your first kiss.A living souvenirof the event.If I were to go into your brain and cut outthose cells, could I make you forget your first kissor could I make you forget where your fingers are?Only if I cut out a lot of your brain.Because memories aren't just stored in onerelationship, they're storedall over the brain. The events leading upto your first kiss are stored in onenetwork,the way it felt to the way it smelled indifferent networks, all added up togethermaking what you call the memory of your first kiss.How many memories can you fitinside your head?What is the storage capacityof the human brain?The best we can do is a roughestimate, but given the number ofneurons in the brain involved withmemoryand the number of different connectionsa single neurone can makePaul Reber at Northwestern University estimatedthat we can store the digital equivalent of about 2.5petabytes of information.That's the equivalent of recording a TV channelcontinuously for 300 years.That's a lot of information.That is a lot of information aboutskills you can do and facts and people you've met,things in the real world.The world is real, right?How do you know?It's a difficult question,but it's not rocket science.Instead, it isasking whether or not rocket scientistseven exist in the first place.The theory that the Sun moved around the earthworked great. It predicted that the Sunwould rise every morningand it did. It wasn't until later that werealized what we thought was truemight not be.So, do weor will we ever know true realityor are we stuck in a world where thebest we can do is beapproximately true? Discovering more andmore useful theories every day but neveractually reachingtrue objective actual reality.Can science or reason ever prove convincinglythat your friends and YouTube videos and your fingersactually exist beyond your mind?That you don't just livein the matrix?No.Your mind is all that you have,even if you use instruments, like a telescopeor particle accelerators.The final stopfor all of that information is ultimatelyyou.You are alone in your own brain,which technically makes it impossible to prove thatanything else exists.It's calledthe egocentric predicament.Everything you knowabout the world out there depends onand is created inside your brain.This mattered so much to Charles Sanders Peircethat he drew a linebetween reality, the way the universe truly is,and what he called the phaneron,the world as filtered through our sensesand bodies, the only information we can get.If you want to speak with certainty you live in,that is you react to and remember and experience yourphaneron, not reality.The belief that only you existand everything else, food, the universe,your friends are allfigments of your mind is calledsolipsism.There is no way to convincea solipsist that the outside worldis real.And there is no way to convince someone whodoubts that the universe wasn't createdjust three seconds agoalong with all of our memories.It's a frightening realizationthat we don't always know how to deal with.There's evenThe Matrix defense.In 2002Tonda Lynn Ansley shot and killed her landlady.She argued that she believed she was inthe matrix, that her crimesweren't real.By using the matrix defenseshe was found not guiltyby reason of insanity, because theopposite view is just way more healthyand common.It's called realism.Realism is the belief that theoutside world exists independently of your ownphaneron.Rocks and stars and Thora Birchwould continue to exist even if you weren't aroundto experience them.But you cannotknow realism is true.All you can dois believe.Martin Gardner, a great source for math magic tricks,explained that he is not a solipsistbecause realism is just way moreconvenientand healthy and it works.As to whether it bothered him that hecould never know realism was true,he wrote \"if you ask me to tell youanything about the nature of what liesbeyond the phaneron,my answer is how should I know?I'm not dismayed by ultimate mysteries,I can no more grasp what is behind such questionsas my cat can understand what isbehind the clatter i makewhile I type this paragraph.\"Humble stuff.What strikes meis the cat.Cats do not understand keyboards,but they know the keyboards are a fun place to be.It's a great way to get the attentionof a human, they're warmand exciting, surrounded by noises andflashing lights pluscats love to get their scenton whatever they can,a mark of their existence.We aren't that much different,except instead of keyboardswe have the mysteries of the universe.We will never be able to understand allof them. We won't be able to ever answerevery single question,but walking around in those questions, exploring them,is fun.It feels good.And as always,thanks for watching.Do you want more unanswered questions?Well, you're in luck.Today, nine other amazing channels onYouTube have made videosabout questions we still haven't fully answered.Alltime10s has organized them and to watch them allclick the annotation at the end of this video or the linkat the top of the description.Enjoy.",

   "title": "What's The Brightest Thing In the Universe?",
   "publishedAt": "03 Feb 2014",
   "transcription": "Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.This symbol, commonly called a Yin Yangsymbol, is a taijitu meaning diagramof the supreme ultimate. The principalof Yin and yang, opposites existing inharmony,is associated with ancient Chinesephilosophy.But the very first use of the iconography,the classic symbol,actually comes from a shield patternused by the ancientRomans seven hundred years before its firstknown use in China.A connection between the twohas yet to be found.Regardless of who came up with it first,the symbol was a bright idea.But what's the brightest object in the entire universe?Well, apparent magnitude.Commonly used when stargazing refers tohow bright an objectappears to us, say, when looking up from Earth.It depends on Earth-centric factors,like how close the object isto our planet. Magnitudes are logarithmicand arranged like golf, where a smaller numbermeans a greater brightness. But todayI'm looking for absolute magnitude,a measure of how bright things all overthe universe nearand far would be if we looked at themfrom the same distance.Absolute magnitude will guideus to the most blindinglight in the universe, irrespective of it looking faintto us here on Earth, just because it's far away.The difference is significant. A 100-watt light bulbplaced closer than 8 centimetres - about3 inches - from your eyewill appear brighter than the Sun in the sky.But that's not fair. If you could see the Sun and the bulbfrom the same distance, the Sun would bea septillion times brighter.That's bright. But the Sunshines punily compared to the rest of the cosmos.If you could line the Sun up witheverything else out there,giving every star and cosmologicalphenomenona fair chance, the Sun's absolute magnitudewould be 4.8. Not bad. But check outR136a1. This nuclear fuelled beast isn'tthe biggest star in terms of volume but it's 256times more massive than our Sun.It's the most massive starever found and it's also the brightest.Remember that lower absolutemagnitudes are brighter.R136a1 isn't 4.8,like our Sun, it is -12.6,which means it is 8.7 million times brighterthan our own Sun. But R136a1isn't the brightest thing out there.When a giant star dies, it explodes violentlyin what is known as a supernovaor hypernova. As I mentioned in my video'How Hot Can It Get?',supernovas can eject terrifying flashes ofradiation known as gamma ray bursts.Arguably,the brightest electromagnetic events inthe universe.A typical gamma-ray burst releases as muchenergy in a few seconds as our Sunwill release altogether in its entire10 billion year lifetime. If WR104,a gamma-ray burst future candidate, directly struckEarth with such a beam for only 10 secondsastronomers predict it could deplete 25% of ourozone layer and lead to mass extinction and starvation.The largest thermonuclear bomb ever detonateddidn't do anything close to that and itwas exploded righthere, in our atmosphere. Whereas WR104is eight thousand light years away.You can't even see it with your naked eyeor a pair of binoculars.But gamma ray bursts are merely briefevents lasting only a few minutes at most, sometimesjust a matter of milliseconds. If you want the brightestsustained thing, you'll paradoxically have to lookat the darkest thing. Black holes.To be fair, dark matter is ostensiblydarker. But because dark matter has been hypothesizedto not even interact with light, with electromagnetismat all, calling dark matter \"not bright\"is kind of like calling your peanut butter sandwich\"a not fast airplane\".It's not really even in the same category.Black holes, however, do interact with light;reflecting so little, well, they don't let anyescape, at least not in a form resembling the wayit came in. That's dark.But the intense energies created byblack holes in the process of eatingthings like starsis anything but dark.Gas and debris from the stars they eat swirl intoarcipluvian cosmic gallows known as accretion discsbefore making their final death plungeinto the black hole.In the disc, debris spins at unfathomablespeeds, pulled around by a black holebillions of times more massivethan our Sun.Friction in the accretion disk generates heaton a level difficult to fully appreciate.Just as hot things glow, the disk does too.So brightly it has its own name.A quasar.Quasars shine thousands of times more brightlythan even the brightest stars.I'm kidding, it's scarierthan that.Quasars shine thousands of times more brightlythan galaxies containing billions of stars.The first identified quasar, 3C 273,has an absolute magnitudeof -26.7, making itfour trillion times brighter than our Sun,about 100 times more luminous than thetotal amount of light produced by theentire Milky Way. If you put 3C 27333 light years away from us it wouldshine as brightly as our Sun - a mere 8 light minutes away.Blocking the brightness of a quasar with the coronagraph reveals that quasars exist in thecenters of galaxiesthat are larger than them in area, but are, nonetheless,drowned out by their light.Such galactic centres are called active galactic nuclei.The bulk of their energy spewing forthin the form of a powerful radiation jet,the length of which puts evenour solar system to shame.The visible part of the jetin this photograph, for instance, is solong it could stretch from the Sunto Pluto and back, one-and-a-half million times.Now, specifically, if a large portion ofthis ajected energy heads toward Earth,it's responsible for what we call a quasar.But if Earth is right and the activegalactic nucleus' sights,it's got a scarier name: a blazar.And it's blazar 3C 454.3 that clockedin the greatest brightnessever observed.At historically high levels of activity it registered inabsolute magnitude of -31.4.To put the brightness of quasarsin yet another perspective, take a lookat the one hundred thousandthpicture snapped by the Hubble telescope.This is a star a few hundred light years away.And this thing looks just about as bright,but it is a quasar.9 billion light years away.Why are quasars so far away?Well, a quasar is not forever.They are billions of light years away,which means the light we receive fromthem, the pictures we take of them,are pictures of things happeningbillions of years ago.They represent a phenomenon more commonearly in the universe's history, whenmonster black holes hadn't eatenall the stars around them to fuel theiraccretion discs andbefore those holes became too fat to be active.Neil deGrasse Tyson points out that in order to remaina quasar producer, a black hole must consumeabout 10 stars a year. Manyconsume more than a thousand stars a year, 600Earths worth of matter every single minute. The morestars a black hole consumes,the larger its event horizon becomesuntil, eventually, it no longer shreds stars apartto fuel an accretion disc.Instead, it just swallows them wholein one dimmer, but still terrifying, gulp.Quasars are some of the mostancient things in our universe.If you could teleport instantaneously to one right nowfaster than light, it would most likelyno longer be burning. What we seeare just their ghosts. Light that left when they wereactive that traveled longer than they could live.But quasars can still be born. They can even be bornright here, in fact. In my video'What Will We Miss?' I pointed out thatthe Andromeda Galaxyis headed our way.In 3 to 5 billion years it will collidewith our own galaxy, the Milky Way. And the collisioncould rearrange stars near thegalaxy's central black holes to be consumed,reigniting a quasar right here, in our galactic backyard.Funny enough, right now very few of us even seeAndromeda, even though all youneed is your unaided eye.Light from our cities drowns out the night sky like aquasar drowns out its host galaxy. ArtistThierry Cohen mocked up what big citieswould look like if all their lights wereoff and the sky above them could be seenfully. New York, Hong Kong, Shanghai,Tokyo, Los Angeles. It's beautifuland rare. In the 1990s,during a blackout in the city of Los Angeles,a number of residenceactually called the police they wereafraid of mysterious glowing cloudshovering above the city. They were seeingour galaxy for the first time in their lives.At night, artificial lights allow us to seewhat's around us but we losewhat's above us. The brightest placeshave the darkest, emptiest skies.There's Yin and Yang again. A taijituhas actually been lurking in this videothe entire time.The brightest things in the universe, quasars,are caused by the darkest things in the universe -black holes. The process that unshackles the most lightis caused by the thing that best imprisons it.And as always,thanks for watching.",

   "title": "The Cognitive Tradeoff Hypothesis",
   "publishedAt": "05 Dec 2018",
   "transcription": "[clangs]This is Inuyama, Japan,a historic cityhome to Japan's oldestoriginal wooden castle.It is also hometo Kyoto University'sPrimate Research Institute. Here, a group of chimpanzees have been trained to play a game that exposes something shocking about their memories. This is going to blow your mind. Here is how it works. Take a look at these numbers. 1, 2, 3. Remember where they are, because they're about to disappear. Can you point to where each number used to be in numerical order? Probably. It's pretty easy. 1, 2, 3. But what if we make it harder? Get ready to point to where each number was in order... now. If you feel like you didn't have enough time to memorize the screen, that's fine. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Or is it? Here is a chimpanzee taking exactly that long to memorize the same arrangement. Nailed it. Each of these puzzles is completely new to the chimpanzee, but just a glance is all it needs to completely capture all the numbers. How can a chimpanzee's memory be so much better than ours? Well, one theory is that we humans are worse at this task because we can talk.What makes humans differentfrom other animals?Well, one thing is language.We have the cognitive abilityto communicate not just aboutwhat's happening now,but also about what did happen,and what could happen.We can tell stories,and it's awesome.But if language is so good,why didn't any other animaldevelop it like we did? A good approach to this question is one that looks at how we are different from those who were almost us. Around 7 million years ago, there were no chimpanzees and there were no humans. But there were CHLCAs, an acronym which stands for \"Chimpanzee-Human Last Common Ancestor.\" Like us, CHLCAs didn't have great natural offenses or defenses, protective shells or claws, fangs or venom. So living in the safety of the trees was great. Those who stayed became the chimps we know today. But for reasons we're still not quite sure of, some of the CHLCAs decidedto venture down to the savanna. Without appropriate physical abilities, things like cooperation, imagining new strategies, and the assigning of roles were necessary for survival, all of which are easier if you have a rich collection of symbols that can refer to things across time: language. Many different types of creatures emerged with varying adaptations. But today, only one member of the family remains. Us.Language as we know it may havebeen one of the strategiesthat kept us alivein the savanna.But where did it move in?The brains of thosewho developed languageand those who didn'taren't totally different.A brand-new brain structuredidn't just pop into existence.Instead, anatomy usedfor other tasksmust have been sacrificed.And as it turns out,for beautiful reasons,detailed short-term memorymay have beena fair thing to losein return for language.This trade-offbetween memory and languageis the Cognitive TradeoffHypothesis. The Cognitive Tradeoff Hypothesis is the culmination of decades of work by one of the world's leading primatologists, Professor Tetsuro Matsuzawa of Kyoto University's Primate Research Institute. Founded in 1967, the institute was created for scientific research in association with the nearby Japan Monkey Center.The collaborative centers house over 60 species and nearly 1,000 primates who live and play in open spaces.Look at monkeys.[monkeys chitter]Is there a babyon that one?-[Michael] Six months?-[Tetsuro] Yes.[gibbers]That's where they live.[Michael]Can you do it?[grunts] Dr. Matsuzawa has spent over 40 years researching non-human primates. He splits his time between fieldwork in the West African country of Guinea, and here in Japan, where he and his colleagues have developed a chimpanzee habitat designed to mimic life in the wild.This habitat is home to Skylab, a working laboratory set high atop the chimpanzee'' climbing structure. In this open air lab, chimpanzees are free to come and go as they please.And this is how you move? If they decide to stay, they participate in cognitively enriching tasks designed to mimic foraging behavior. When the chimpanzees are interested in participating, they enter one of Skylab's specially designed computer booths, where a camera uses facial recognition software to recognize them and select a test based that particular chimp's current familiarity with the task. Each trial takes about as long as it would for a chimp to forage a single bite. And each morsel of food they get is accounted for in their diet.Do the doors openwhen they approach?No human even needs to be...? So, what is for us a great way to collect data, is for them an experience similar in many ways to what they would be doing in the wild.Impressive. Dr. Matsuzawa has been running memory tests like these on chimpanzees since 1978. His research has shown the phenomenal and nearly photographic short-term memory of these primates. Two of the most famous chimps at the PRI are Ai, named after the Japanese word for \"love,\" and her son Ayumu, whose name means \"walk.\" What can we learn about ourselves by studying chimpanzees like them? Well, I want to find out.If we and chimpanzeescome from a common ancestor,what can explain the splitwhere the chimpanzeesdon't seem to needor to develop languagelike we did?Why would that happen?Was it an accident?Ah-ha.Our habitat...provided a pressureto develop language.Yes.-That's incredible.-Mm.So, in a way, we should bereally gratefulthat our ancestorswere so weak,they got pushedout of the trees.[thumping]-Bang, bang.-[laughs][Michael] I'd invite you to bea part of this interview,but you don't have language.Right now.Mm-hmm.Quick decisions.Our ancestors didn't havethat same pressure?Hmm.[Michael] The Cognitive Tradeoff Hypothesis suggests that in the dangerous world beyond the trees, early humans needed to teach each other and use abstract symbols that could refer not just to the immediate here and now, but to hypotheticals and generalities. Making room for that kind of abstract thinkingmeant sacrificing the immediate and detailed memory of their ancestors.Yeah.I'm able to imaginepast and future.I'm able to describe thingsin an abstract way.And I don't need the details,because I have the label.So it seems like a pretty goodtrade-off.Yeah.Yeah.What a great message, right?Sharing is what makes us \"us.\"I would love to see yourworking memory testson chimpanzees in action.I would also really loveto participate myselfand see how well I can docompared to a chimpanzee.Yes.Have you ever hada human and a chimpanzeecompete like thattogether?-[hooting]-[Michael] They're excited-about the idea too.-[laughs][gibbering][Michael]An opportunity to do the memory task just like a chimpanzee is really special. Who knows how it will go? Let's see who shows up.-[clapping]-[Michael] Yeah!You're really goodat this, Ai. Looks like today,it will be celebrity chimp, Ai. Ai is older now, and just like in humans, her cognitive abilities have decreased with time. So I may actually stand a chance. To face off against Ai, I will be sitting in the booth next to her. Normally, her son Ayumu plays against her. But today, well,she's in for some Michael time.I'm not your child, though,am I? The tests are going to get harder as we go along. How will my memory compare to that of a chimp who never made the same cognitive trade-off?[exhales] In the first round, the task is to rememberwhere each of the three numbers are in numerical order. But here's the trick: as soon as I touch one of them on the screen, the other two will be covered by solid squares, so I can no longer see where they are. Now, well, it's up to my memory.[Tetsuro]Okay, let's go.[Michael] If I make a mistake, I get an error noise like this...[buzzer] ...while a correct answer sounds like this.[computer chirps] When the chimpanzee gets it right, they are rewarded with apples. The human, me, well, just gets the bragging rights.I'm not getting apples.[laughs][computer chirps]You really actually haveto focus more than I expected.Almost messed that one up.[buzzer][computer chirps][Tetsuro]How did Michael do?95.[Michael] On my first run, I've managed to beat Ai.What is the next task?How many symbols?Whoa.[computer chirps]This is a lot harder. This game is similar to the last, but starts a little bit differently. This time, three numbers appear on a blank screen, but as soon as I touch the first one, the entire screen is covered in boxes.[computer chirps]Whew.[buzzer][computer chirps][buzzer][Michael]Ai...you having fun?-Whoa!-[grunts] Ai is used to Ayumu, her son, playing the game beside her, so my presence may be throwing her off.I'm here for moral support, Ai. It was fun squaring off against Ai, but I want to see how I would do against her son, Ayumu.I'm ready.Okay...[Michael] Ayumu is currently Matsuzawa's best pupil, able to ace the memory tests at blazingly fast speeds.[computer chirps] But today, Ayumu is not interested in mental combat. He's busy flirting with some young ladies who live with him here at the PRI. And since free choice is the guiding principle of Matsuzawa's research, we can't make him join us. The good news is that Ayumu doesn't need to be here for me to compete against him. The game can be presented to me just as Ayumu does it: with nine numerals. Let's see if my luck is the same against Ayumu as it was against Ai.Oh, man.Okay.-[buzzer]-Wow.[laughs]Even when I take timeI can't do it right.Okay, more time.[buzzer]I thought I had that one.It takes a long time to memorizenine numerals' positions.[buzzer]It's embarrassinghow long this takes me.I can do this one.[computer chirps]All right.Yeah.You don't needto laugh about it.Thirteen.I got better, yeah,because you were pressuring me.Jesus.Six times worse,six times slower.Yeah. I would love to.[Michael] This is the most difficult test. I have to remember all nine numbers in numerical order at Ayumu's speed, which is to say, I have to do what I could barely do before, but now I have to memorize them all within the amount of time it takes to blink.So I get half a secondto prepare?I'm going to prove you wrong. As a reminder, this is how Ayumu performs, which is standard for a young chimp.You got to be kidding me.-That's way too fast.-[buzzer]I got the first three.[buzzer]It's like a joke.[buzzer][laughs]I don't know where the 2 is.[buzzer]It's too fast.Trying to think of thisvery holistically.[buzzer][clears throat][buzzer]After the first three,if I see them,I'm just having to guess.[laughs][buzzer]Yeah. It's impossible.Well, I hope this washelpful for you.It was the first time you hadhad a chimpanzee and a humantogether in the booth.What do you think--?[both laugh]If you ever need meto study as a primate,-I give myself to you.-Okay.Wow.And we need to make sureto preserve them.-They're already endangered.-Yes.And yet they are our closestlink to understandingwhat we came fromand where we might go.[Tetsuro]Mm.[Michael] It's like taking careof your family.-[Tetsuro] Mm, right.-[Michael] Quite literally.[Tetsuro]Yes.[snarling][Michael] The fact that humans alone use complex symbolic language doesn't make us any better than any other species. It just means that the path we took required it. In fact, in some ways we aren't better, because we can talk. Today, we study those who took different paths as a way to learn more about ourselves. If we lose them, we lose part of our story, where we came from, who we are, and who we can be in the future.[gibbering][shrieks] And, as always, thanks for watching.

twentyfive but the world record for thelargest number ever counted two belongsto Jeremy Harper from Birmingham Alabamain order to set the record Harper neverleft his apartment he got regular sleepbut from the moment he woke up in themorning until the moment he went to bedat night Harper did nothing but count hestreamed the entire process over theInternet and raised money for charitywhile doing it but after three months ofcounting all day every day he finallyreached the world record 1 million now amillion might not sound like a lot butthink of it this wayone thousand seconds is about 17 minutesbut a million seconds is more thaneleven days and a billion seconds wellthat's more than 31 years there's nofull video online of Harper counting allthe way to a million but you can watchJohn Hart Chuck count all the way to100,000 if you have 74 hours to spareJohn also has some other channels oneinvolves more than 300 videos of himselfeating carrots another more than 3,000videos of himself drinking watermany of John's videos literally have noviews they are as lonely as a video onYouTube can get a great way to find suchvideos is a website made by Yann Vandercruson this website autoplays videos onYouTube that no one has yet watched Johnand Jeremy as well as Mike the onebreath counter counted like this 1 2 3 45 6 7 and so on but that's not the onlyway to count and it doesn't seem to bethe one we're born with additivecounting is the one we're all familiarwith where each next step is justadded to the last but what if wemultiplied by a number instead well thatkind of counting is logarithmic fromErath most meaning number and logosmeaning ratio proportion on this scalesimilar distances are similarproportions one is a third of three andthree is a third of nine four is a thirdof twelve and so on our brains perceivethe world around us on a logarithmicscale it's believed that almost all ofour senses are multiplicative notadditive for example how loud weperceive a sound to be to boomboxesplaying at the same volume don't soundtwice as loud as one in order to make asound that is perceived as being abouttwice as loud as one boomboxyou actually need ten times as many soten and to double that loudness youwould need a hundred and to double thatloudness you would need a thousandhaving an intuitive sense of logarithmicscales built into your brain is probablyan advantage when it comes to naturalselection and survival because oftenproportion matters more than absolutevalue for example is there one lionhiding over there in the shadows or twois a very different question then arethere 96 lions about to attack us orninety seven sure in both cases I'm justtalking about one extra lion but addingone lion to one lion doubles the threatadding one lionto 96 well that's basically nothingmother admits thinking and feeling theyexplain why life seems to speed up as weget older it seems like I was a childforever and then college in my early 20sjust whizzed by and logarithmically thatmakes sense because each new year that Ilive is a smaller fraction of all theother years I've already lived when youturn 2 years old the last year of yourlife is half your life but when you turn81 that last year that you've lived wellthat's just a tiny part of the other 80that you know logarithmic thinking isn'talways helpful especially in scenarioswhere proportion doesn't logicallymatter but we nonetheless act like itdoes one of my favorite examples is thepsychophysics of Christ's paradox thisis something almost all of us doresearch has found consistently thatpeople are willing to put a lot ofeffort into saving five dollars off a$10 purchase but they won't put mucheffort into saving five dollars off a$2,000 purchase it's five dollars savedeither way but our natural obsessionwith proportion leads us astray take alook at these pictures can you tell howmany objects are in each of them youprobably can it's like really easy youcan tell if there are 0 1 2 3 or 4objects in a photo without even needingto count how are you doing that is itsome sort of sixth sense nopsychologists call it sabotaging we canintuitively at a glance determinewhether there are about four or fewerobjects in a photo this has been part ofhuman culture for a very long time andit may be the reason so many tallysystems from all over the world allthrough history wind up having to dosomething different when counting thenumber 5 when estimating or comparingamounts above 4 the brain uses what'sknown as an approximate number systemit's a psychological ability we havethat's about 15% accurate if two amountsare at least 15 percent different we cantell so for example 100 objects andfifteen or a thousand and eleven fiftyor twelve hundred if you want to testthe accuracy of your approximate numbersystem panamath has a pretty good testwe often take linear additive countingfor granted but it's not granted to uswe aren't born with it we are howeverborn with the ability to subah ties anduse an approximate number systemchildren younger than the age of threecan tell without counting that this lineof four coins contains fewer coins thanthis line of six even if you spread thefour coins out into a line that isphysically bigger longer than this lineof sixhowever mysteriously around the age ofthree and a half children lose thisability and begin saying that this lineof six coins contains fewer coins thanthis long line of just four coinspossibly because around this age thephysical world of objects of physicalsizes is more salient in their minds butthen when they begin to learn linearcounting they reverse back and beginagain correctly saying that this line ofsix contains more coins in this line offour around the age of four the smallestphysical thing science could ever hopeto observe is the Planck length in orderto look at anything smaller you wouldneed to have so much energy concentratedin such a small area a black hole wouldform and you would lose whatever youwere looking at okay with that in mindhere's a question what number is halfwayin between one and nine five seems likethe obvious answer there are fournumbers on either side of five it'shalfway between right well if you askthis question of a young child or amember of a culture that doesn't teach alinear additive number line their answerwill be three you see they areexhibiting the human minds

   "publishedAt": "17 Jul 2017",
   "transcription": "Hey, Vsauce, Michael hereAnd here, I am the real MichaelThis Michael was created by a brilliant young man named Mitchell,who brought it to me at a meet-and-greet after Brain Candy LiveIt is phenomenal and obviously the most handsome jack-in-the-box everEver-est is a mountain that's 8.848 km tallIts size is impressiveOr is it?(Characteristic music of Vsauce, get prepared to be mind = blown)Let's cut Earth, the entire planet, right in half,straight through Everest, and then start zooming outAs you can see, Everest's monumentality quickly disappears against Earth's planetary ginormosityCompared to Earth's diameterEverest\u2014in fact, all of Earth's ruggedness\u2014barely registersThat can seem surprising, since we are often surrounded by diagrams and maps and globesthat exaggerate Earth's topographyThere is a good reason to do that,but it leads to a misconception about just how smooth Earth isHere's a typical example:a cross section of the United States that I found on redditThe vertical axis spans about 10,000 ft,but the horizontal axis represents nearly 14 million ftStretched to the same scale so as to mirror reality,the actual smoothness of the Earth becomes apparentOn this 1 ft diameter globe,Everest is a bump about 2 mm highFeels good!But if the Earth was actually this small,Everest would be a bump only 0.2 mm highIt's 10 times taller than it should beOnly 24 people have seen the Earth, with their own eyes, as a circle small enough to be looked right at;not as the whole world, but as a little thing suspended alone in spaceThe further away you are from a ball, the more of its surface you can seeWe don't always notice this,because in our day-to-day lives,most of the balls we deal with are so smallthey're almost always many of their own radii away from us,and the available amount of their surface visible is near a maximumOr, they're so big, like the Earth, that we rarely get far enough away fast enough to notice this propertyBut the next time you are near a ball, get close to itYou'll see that as you get nearer, more of its surface disappears behind the horizon,but moving back up will make it available againFor most of us, stuck our whole lives on Earth's surface,such an experience is impossibleWIth nothing around to block your view,5 km (about 3 mi) is about the furthest you can seeHaze can limit your view and atmospheric refraction can slightly extend it,but for the most part, everything you can see happens within an area of just 80 km^2That's not bad, but it's tiny compared with what there is to seeThe higher up you go, of course, the further away you will be able to seeThat's why it's great to be a satelliteHere's the International Space StationYeah, look at that nice bit portion of the surface in viewUnfortunately, this isn't to scaleIf the Earth were the size of an apple,how far away would the International Space Station  orbit?Like this far away?Maybe this far awayMaybe this far awayActually, it orbits\u2026 here,2.7 mm above the surfaceThat's how far the stem of this apple sticks upIt's not very farOh, here's another fun little to scale fact:if the Earth were the size of an apple, your eyeball would be about the size of the moonWe often imagine that from the International Space Station,astronauts see the Earth like this, but they're just not that far awayFrom where they actually orbit,International Space Station residents only see about 3% of Earth's surface at any one timeAnd that 3% is too wide to all fit within a windowWhen I was in Pittsburgh, their science museum had a mock-up of part of the ISSAnd as you can see, out of the window, Earth is still quite expansiveUsing special lenses, images can be taken from the ISS that look like circular disk Earths,but the lens is distorting things hereIt's fitting much more into the pictureIn order to truly witness Earth's entire shape with your own eyes,you would need to either smash your face right up against the windowor just be floating outside the stationAnd even then, you would have to move your head to see from edge to edgeSo, how high up do you have to go to see the edges of Earth all at once?And, even if you did that, how much would you actually see?How much is there to see?Earth is made of stuff,lots of stuff: water and dirt and rocks and air, all of which are composed of atomstiny things so teeny that a single drop of water contains not a million atoms,not a billion atoms, or a trillion, or a quadrillion, or a quintillion but 5 sextillion atomsEarth is made of even more stuff:not a septillion atoms, not an octillion, nonillion,decillion, undecillion, duodecillion, tredecillion,not even a quattuordecillion but 100 quindecillion atomsBut since we live only on the surface of our planet, we unfortunately can't see most of those atomsIf the Earth was shaped like a disk or an icosahedron,or, say, a cube, or a rectangular prism, or two stellated rhombic dodecahedrons,we could see more of the Earth than we normally canBut as things are, we actually see nearly the least of Earth's matter possiblebecause of all solids, a sphere, which the Earth approximately is,has the smallest surface-area-to-volume ratio\u2014the most stuff inside and the least stuff outsideSo, how many of these 10^50 atoms that make up Earth are on the surface for us to see?That's not an easy questionFor one thing, technically, atoms on the surfaces of opaque things like rocks and dirtaren't the only parts involved in their appearancesSub-surface scattering can and does happenRegardless, attempting even a rough approximation is illuminatingI asked Grant from the YouTube channel 3Blue1Brown for some helpAnd he pointed out that if you calculate the number of circles with atom-sized radiithat could, packed optimally, cover a sphere with the surface area of Earth, you'll get about 1.5\u00d710^34That's a lot of atomsBut then he pointed out that the Earth's surface isn't smoothIts roughness provides extra surface area for atoms to occupyWithout a complete description of the shape of Earth's surface\u2014every mountain and valley,every bump on every rock\u2014this is just gonna be hopeless, right?Well, here's the thing, Earth is made of little rugged shapes that from far away make big rugged shapesIn other words, Earth's surface can be described as a fractalThere is a regularity to its roughnessIn fact, mathematicians have even assigned a fractal dimension to Earth's surface: 2.3To see what that means, I highly recommend Grant's video on fractal dimensionsIt's fascinatingUsing 2.3 and assuming that it applies from the scale of a human hair up to that of a mountain,Grant found that the number of atoms on Earth's surface changes significantly:up from a power of 34 to a power of 37That's 1000 times more atomsSo, maybe we shouldn't count Earth's roughness out just yetIt's smooth, but not perfectlyTo put that number in perspective, the human body contains about 10^27 atomsThat's 10 powers of 10 less than the surface of the Earth10 powers of 10 is 10 billionThere are about 7.5 billion humansSo, more or less, it can be said that there are the same number of atoms in every human body right nowas there are on the surface of the EarthAs I've shown before, all human bodies piled into one place would barely even fill the Grand Canyon,but all human atoms spread across the Earth would almost perfectly cover it just one atom deepFun fact: the mass of the atmosphere is about 2.5% lessthan what you would get by multiplying sea level pressure (14.7 psi) by the surface area of the Earthbecause Earth's terrain displaces about that much airHuh, Earth's surface is pretty coolObviously, I mean it got lichen and monster trucksand an island in a lake on an island in a lake on an islandBut from down here, on its surface, we just can't see that much of itYour view of Earth is obstructed by lots of opaque things: walls, buildings, trees, rocks, terrainIf Earth was flat, you could see further, but sorry, it's a rough world out thereOr is it?If you could hold the Earth in your hands like this, how bumpy would it actually feel?We already saw that even our planet's biggest bumps barely register relative to Earth's sizeBut let's go somewhere famously flat,where relative to our size, terrain rarely gets in the way of seeing lots of the planet:the US state of KansasI grew up here and took this footage while driving across the state last yearYou can probably see why Kansas is often called \"flatter than a pancake\"However, although it is famously flat, Kansas is not the flattest US stateIn a fantastic piece of research, Jerome Dobson and Joshua Campbell defined \"looks flat\" like this:if, from a given point, any part of the terrain within the horizon rises more than 0.32\u00b0 up(about the height of a 30 m hill at the horizon),a typical person would say, \"Hey! That part's not flat!\"By cleverly applying this rule to topographical data, they were able to give every state a flatness scoreWest Virginia was the least flatKansas was only the seventh flattestDelaware, Minnesota, Louisiana, North Dakota and Illinois are all, by this method, flatter than KansasAs was the number 1 flattest state: FloridaAdam Savage and I had the pleasure of visiting Florida with our Brain Candy Live show this year,and as this footage from atop the King Center in Melbourne, Florida shows, it's pretty gosh dang flatEven though Kansas is not the flattest,it is the state most often ranked flattest when the general population is askedIt is truly, scientifically flatter than a pancake\u2014it's been demonstratedBut there's more to the story than thatIn 2003, researchers took a 130 mm wide pancake procured from IHOP and analysed its local reliefsThey found the difference between high and low points was on the order of about 2 mmIf a typical pancake like this was the size of Kansas, 5 million times larger,2 mm high peaks would be 10 km high mountainsIn comparison, Mount Everest is only about 8.8 km talland Earth's deepest scar, the Marianas Trench, is thought to be just under 11 km deepSo, not only is Kansas about as smooth as a pancake, but so is every other state in the unionand so is the entire worldIf you were a giant holding the planet in your hands like this,you and it would be torn apart by the immense tidal forces created by your gravitiesIf somehow you could avoid that though,the planet would feel not much rougher than running your hands over a pancakeBut a soggy one, right?I mean, most of Earth's surface is covered in water\u2014your hands would get wetOr would they?Yes, Earth is covered in liquid, but the depth of that liquid, like the mountains above,just doesn't compare to the total size of the planetAs it turns out, if the Earth was the size of a typical classroom globe like this one, 1 ft in diameter,the volume of water contained in, above and on it would only be about 14 mLThat's this much waterIt's kinda hard to believe because at this scale, spreading this much water across all of the ocean surfaceswould be pretty much impossible due to surface tensionBut, this is it:all of Earth's water compared to all of Earth90% of the space on our planet life can live in is in hereThe other 10% is dry landSo, no, you wouldn't get wrinkly fingers playing with an Earth like thisYou could sop it dry just with a paper towelDespite the incredible area oceans cover on our planet,their depth is just nothing compared to the size of our entire planetYou may have heard it said that if the entire planet were shrunk down to the size of a billiard ball,it would be smoother than a billiard ballAfter all we've seen so far, that seems believable, but as it turns out, it's not trueThe misconception stems from the interpretation of the World Pool-Billiard Association's rulesAccording to them, a ball must have a diameter of 2.25 in \u00b1 0.005 inSome writers have taken this to mean that pits and bumps of 0.005 in are allowedProportionately, on Earth, that would mean a mountain that was 28 km highSo, since Earth has none of those, Earth must be smoother than a billiard ballExcept if bumps that high were actually allowed on a pool ball,a ball covered with 120 grit sandpaper would be within regulationClearly, the 0.005 in rule is more about roundness, deviation from a sphere, and not textureIn fact, as microscopic photography has shown, imperfections on regulation balls are only 1/100,000 in,or about 0.5 \u03bcm deep and highScaled to the size of a billiard ball, Earth's Marianas Trench would be 49 \u03bcm deepSo, Earth is smoother than a pancake but not smoother than a billiard ballNor, as xkcd wonderfully showed, is Earth smoother than a bowling ballBut hold on, earlier we were using the word \"flat\", now we were using the word \"smooth\"That distinction is importantYou see, the Earth isn't flat like a plane (or is it?)Instead, it curvesIt's a ballPieces of Earth, like Kansas, might be quite smooth, but they curve along with EarthIf you were to stand in the middle of Kansas,people on the eastern or western edges of the state would appear to be, not level with you,but about 8.1 km below youThat's nearly the height of EverestAnd if they stood straight up, they'd be tilted nearly 2\u00b0 relative to where you thought up wasHere is an interesting coincidence:generally speaking, 1 mi from where you are, Earth curves down about 8 in;1 km from where you stand, it curves down about 8 cmThe rate of drop due to curvature isn't a linear oneYou can't just multiply any distance by 8 to get the drop due to curvatureInstead, use an online calculator like the one I have linked down in this video's descriptionYou can put in any distance you wantAnyway, the visibility limit caused by Earth's curvature is your horizonIt encircles you like a visual cage,but it's a cage whose radius is determined by how high up your eyes areConan O'Brien, at 6 ft 4 in tall, can see up to 5 km in any direction,but Snooki, at 4 ft 8 in, can only see about 4.3 kmTo find out how far away your horizon is,geometrically, just use the online tools I've put down in the description belowEarth's texture can get in the way of your horizon but can also cause things beyond the horizon to peek into viewHeyWhatsThat.com factors all of this inIf Earth was a smooth sphere, the view from atop Ben Nevis, the highest mountain in the British Isles,would end at the horizon 131 km away (about 80 mi)Such an area would look like thisBut factoring in Earth's ups and downs, here's a more precise boundary of what you can seeLoch Treig, Scottish Gaelic for \"lake of death\", is only about 10 mi from the peakThat's within an 80 mi radius, but it can't be seen because terrain in the way blocks itParts of the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea 8 times further away can be seenThey lie at the limit of the Earth's curvature, just before it bends the surface out of sightThese spikes extending beyond the geometric horizonare caused by things beyond it that are tall enough to peek above Earth's curvatureIn the case of Ben Nevis, this includes high elevation parts of Northern IrelandOK, enough about the surface and what it's like close up, let's go further away and see moreThis'll be fun, but there'll be a trade-offThe further away you are from something, the smaller it will appear to beMoving away from Earth will make more area available to see, but that area will take up less of your field of viewIt can be difficult to illustrate this in a YouTube video,because your field of view, the shape and size of what you can see with you head still,just by moving your eyes around, is about 120\u00b0 up and down and more than 180\u00b0 horizontalA screen is just a window of that space\u2014nowhere close to filling it, unless you get uncomfortably closeTo help us visualize large apparent sizes, let's replace the spherical Earth with a flat diskthat's always the same distance from the observerThis disk can be given an apparent size equal to Earth's from any altitude,and the disk can contain on it everything that would fit within your horizons from any altitudeOK, so, standing on the surface looking straight down, Earth will take up nearly a full 180\u00b0 of your field of viewWith your arms extended straight out, parallel to Earth,your fingers will point to the edges of the planet: your horizonFrom 400 km up, about where the ISS orbits, 3% of the Earth's surface is within your horizon,but the Earth will only take up about 140\u00b0 of your visionYour fingers would point to Earth's edges if you narrowed your arms' angles,each by the width of two outstretched fistsOne fist is about 10\u00b0 across at arm's lengthYou can move your eyes from edge to edge horizontally here, but you can't quite take in the full width verticallyBut from more than twice this altitude, 1000 km away, Earth is only 120\u00b0 acrossThat's one less fist width eachThis is perfectThat fits within our narrower vertical field of viewSo, from 1000 km up (about 620 mi),you can just start to see Earth as a complete disk right in front of you at onceHowever,  only 7% of Earth fits within the horizon form up hereImages of Earth taken by satellites this far up, like the Suomi NPP, look kinda weirdI mean, North America doesn't actually take up this much of the globeEarth's 120\u00b0 width has been compressed to fit in an image much narrowerCompare Africa from its height to the famous blue marble picture taken from 45,000 km awayThe latter looks more realistic, like looking at a globe on your deskGeosynchronous satellites are about 35,000 km highFrom their altitude, 43.4%\u2014nearly a whole half\u2014of Earth's surface is visible,but the Earth only takes up a meager 17\u00b0You could completely cover it with two outstretched palmsThat's incredibleBut what about from the Moon?Well, from that far away, Earth is only about 2\u00b0 acrossYou could block it out with your outstretched thumbHowever, you can see more of Earth\u2014you can see further around its curvatureFrom the Moon, 49% of Earth's surface is visibleJust 49If you want to see 50, half of Earth's surface at once, you have to go even further awayIn fact, you have to go infinitely far away, which you can'tThe most of a sphere you can see at once with your own eyes is just halfBut in the real world, way before you were actually infinitely far away,the amount of light reaching you from Earth's surfacewould become so small and infrequent that you wouldn't be able to see anything at allStars, like our Sun, are much brighter and bigger than the Earth,but only a handful have, even with our best technology, been resolved as anything larger than just a single pointFrom 1/1000 of a light-year away, our own Sun would look like every other star in the sky:a single point to the naked eye, only about as wide as R Doradus, the widest star in our skyFrom 91 light-years away, the point of our Sun would dim to a level undetectable by the naked eyeIt would disappearMost of the stars in the night sky you can see with your naked eye are further away than that,we can see them though because they're brighter and bigger than our own Sun,which means if there's life out there, living in systems around the stars we've marvelled atand written stories about since humanity began,chances are, we are not part of their constellations or folkloreWe're a dark patch in the sky to them,an ignorable emptiness framing

   "title": "Where Do Deleted Files Go?",
   "publishedAt": "20 Jul 2013",
   "transcription": "Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.But nowI'm not. I'm gone like 90% ofthe original silent filmsever made.Six of the seven wonders of the ancient worlddeleted, like that text you thought twice about sendingor a Snapchat photo, right?When Stalin decided that Trotsky wasan enemy of the state,he had Trotsky removed from photos he appeared inwith Lenin.Plenty of software tools and professional servicesallow you to do the same.Don't justforget the actual attendees of a moment in time,delete them.But where do things gowhen they're deleted?The Google Ngram Viewer allows youto search words and phrasesin 5.2 million books published between 1500and 2008.It's a great way to see howthe words we use have changed overtime.1979 was a significantyear. According to the Ngram Viewer,it was the first year we begin to use theworddelete more often than the worderase.Biological deletionstill wins though. Forget is by far morepervasive in our communicationbut how does a computer forget?Moving a file to the trash is just the beginning.To protect against accidental deletion,when thrown in the trasha file remains on your computer in atemporary directory, a sort ofpurgatory, where it awaits a moreultimate deletion but can be resurrectedif you wish.When you empty the trashyou are warned that you cannot undo the action.But when you empty the trash, the physical spaceinhabited by the file isn't actually emptied.It's marked as empty.Availableif and when new data needs to be stored somewhere.The file's home has become available real estatebut the file itself hasn't moved out.Only the pointershave gone away. Pointers are another typeof data on your drive that point toplaces in memorywhere the actual file they are referencingcan be found.They're a bit like the table of contents,which means that on mostoperating systems deleting a file and emptying the trashis like deleting a chapter from a bookby turning to the table of contents and markingthe chapter as empty.There's nothing here, do what you want with the pages.To a computer reading the table ofcontents it looks like the space isempty but of course that doesn't changethe fact that the contents of thechapterare still there.Special data recovery toolslook through memory marked empty availableto see what's actually there.If you're lucky,they can even find a file and save it, bring it backmark it not available, undeleted.But if some of the file has already been overwritten,there can be problems.The file can becorrupted, melded together with otherdata like some kind of digitalFrankenstein's monster.A couple years agoa laptop that belonged to photographerMelanie Willhidewas stolen.It contained many of her recent digital photos.Luckily, police were able to return thelaptop to her. They found it in a car theypulled over,but the thief had wiped the laptop'shard drive clean and had been using itfor his own purposes.Data recovery experts were able to findsome of her files, still there,on the now-empty space,but the files had been slightly overwrittenby things the thief had done.They'd been corrupted but in areally cool way.So cool Willhide decided to exhibit the work.She titled the show after the thief who made it possible,\"To Adrian Rodriguez, with love.\"If you want to delete the file so completelyit can't even be recovered in a cool,weird way, like Willhide's photos,you will need to overwrite the unwanted filecompletely.Deny the file a proper burialand rearrange its corpse with new data.One overwrite should be fine but somepeople do as many as 35.Even 35 overwrites might not be enough.Sure, the overridden data is hidden, but what about badsectors? These are parts of a drive thatdevices can't accessbecause of failed transistors or physical damage.An overwrite won't be able to reach them,meaning any data that was ever put therestays there. So, if you are the UnitedStates Department of Defense and youdon't want to take any risks,you will also shred, physically polarizeunwanted drives.The US, Europe, Japanoften send such electronics waste to dumpsin Ghana, like this one.This city in Ghana is known asEarth's digital dumping ground.Why Ghana?Well, it is cheaper to sendunsalvageable electronics to Africa,marked as a donation,than it is to properly recycle them.But there, in these electronic dumps,the files can still be brought back to life.Organized criminals operating in Ghanahave managed to successfully recoverdatafrom unregulated e-dumps.They've been able to find confidentialmulti-million-dollar agreements, involvingthe Defense Intelligence Agency, Homeland Securityand the TSA.Shreddingpaper to get rid of whatever used to beon the paper isn't even safeeither. It's not easy and it doesn'talways work. But by scanningshreds of paper computer software canmatch the pieces together.But in the past, shredded documents have been unshredby hand. In 1979 Iranian students seizedthe US Embassy in Tehran.With the help of local carpet weavers andyears of hard work,they managed to reassemble thousands ofpages of confidential documentsshred by the CIA.The smaller the shredded particlesare and the more of them there are,the more difficult the task. So,the Department of Defense requires thatthe majority of shredded particlesnot exceed 5 square millimetres.If you really want to delete something, destroy it,erase it, time is on your side.In about 5.4 billion yearsthe Sun will become the ultimate shredder.A red giant large enough to swallow earth whole.Everything will be fine for billions of years.But many accepted models of the universepredict that in 10 to the 100yearswhatever intelligence is left willwitness the universe'sdark era and its finalHeat Death, the end of the universe, the end ofany file or photo or memory of youever being accessed again.Every time something happensa little bit of energy is lost.For instance,friction through sound or heat.That energy goes out into the universe alittle bit at a time, slowlymore and more.Eventually, in a closed system,energy becomes homogeneous,evenly distributed, the sameeverywhere.There's no gradient maximumentropy.In a little glass of ice water it's pretty quotidianbut given enough time our entire universemay be no different. A gradient,a difference in energy from one place toanother is necessary forthings to happen, for files to be created and read,for life to exist.And in 10 to the 100 yearsthere may not be any usable energyleft.In Isaac Asimov's short story \"The Last Question\"humans are concerned about this.As the storyleapfrogs billions of years into the future,their list of solutions doesn't get any longerthan none. So, if we think across a grand timescaleis cosmic deletion the freezingof everything, heat death, all we have to look forward toin this universe?We went to the Moon.We broughtflags with us that we planted on theMoon, representing a placeon earth.But those American flags on the Moonare likely erased now,their symbols and colors bleached by theintense radiation of the Sun on thelunar surface,unfiltered by any atmosphere.The flags are still there, we didn'ttake them back with us but now day areempty. White flags.White flags representing our surrenderto the inevitability of deletion in the universe.But we, today, are preoccupied withjust the opposite.What really saturates our language,what we really seem to talk about iscreation.Things happening, notloss.Compared to erase,forget and delete, \"make\" practicallydeletes deletion.The flags on the Moon are bleachedout but is that bleak?Are theydeleted or blank, like a freshsheet of paper ready for new stories?Really, it just depends on what youmake of it.So thanks for making things.And as always,thanks for watching.",

   "title": "What if You Were Born in Space?",
   "publishedAt": "12 May 2013",
   "transcription": "Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.How many peopleare in space right nowdot com tells us that the answeris 6. Ever since the first person reachedouter space 52 years ago, more than 500 humanshave left Earth and they've gone as far as the moon,an impressive distance. I mean, spacestations, which we use in outer spacetodayare way cool, but to scale they onlyorbit about this far away from Earth.Whereasthe Moon, where Apollo astronauts went,is way outhere.For the last twelve years,there has been a continuous anduninterrupted presenceof humans living in space.Different people at different times,ever since November of 2001.But so far,all of us, every human who hasever existed was born right here onEarth. Of course, Earth is a giantcollection of matter that got togetherin space,held together by its own gravity, so technically,we were all born in space.But I wanna talk aboutouter space.What is ourrelation to it and within it?How suited is our biology for thelarger universe we were born into?More specifically, if you were born and raisedbeyond earth, what would you look like?First things first.Whereis outer space?Well, outer space happens to beabout one hundred thousand meters above your head.At that point the atmosphere is so thinthat in order to achieve lift, anaircraft has to travel at a speedso quickly that that speed is the sameas an orbital speed.An orbital speedis a speed that is so fast, even with no lift,even while falling you don't,because the earth literally curvesaway from you as fast as you falltowards it. This is what astronauts inthe International Space Station arereally doing.They're falling. It's a common misconceptionthat astronauts float aroundweightless in space, because there is no gravity there.But there's plenty of gravity.In fact, there's pretty much the same amount ofgravityoperating on them that there isoperating on youright now while you watch this video.Believe it or not,if we build a tower all the way up towhere the International Space Stationorbits, 370,000 meters high,and you walked out onto the top of thattower, it would feel kind of like this.You would just be walking around like I'm walkingright now. You wouldn't feel that much different,but the International Space Stationwould be whizzing byat 17,000 miles per hour.It has to,because they are falling. So to say thatastronauts float around inorbit, because they are experiencing zero gravityis very misleading.Really, what they are feelingis Zero-G, where G is accellerationfelt as weight.G hurtsso good, because gravity's limiting influenceinsures that we develop correctly and healthfully.After all, it is what we were born to thrive in.So asking what a human would look like, if conceivedgestated, delivered and raised in orbitwould look like, requires a discussion of weightlessness.Realistically, people building colonieson planets beyond Earthor traveling through space for longperiods of time,who expected new humans to be born, wouldutilize technology that helped mimicconditions here on earth.But until artificial gravity isperfected and can be easily implemented,it's important to understand the effectweightlessness has onour biology and other things.For instance,in a zero-g environment hot air doesn'trise.So a candle flame is not shaped like a stretchedball of glowing gas that's drawn upward.Instead, it's just a roundball of hot gas.We are not sure we can make babiesin space. The logistics of merelyhugging are difficult enough.A recent invention, called the '2suit',might make it easier.The 2suit provides effortless intimacyin weightless environment, such asouter space or on planets with low gravity.But will it be enough to ensure thatconception happens?The enzyme responsible for stopping themovement of a sperm cell'stale doesn't work very well when they're at zero-g.In space, spermsswim faster.One thing we know about babiesinside mothers in space involves the developmentof the vestibular system. Canals in theinner ear that use the flow of fluidto determine movement, up versus down and balance.In a zero-g environment the fluid in thevestibular system just floats around.It's confused.And this can lead to motion sickness,visual illusions and disorientation.It's calledspaced adaptation syndrome and itaffects about 50 percentof astronauts.Confusion about motion can make youvomit, carsick, seasick, zero-g sick,because of survival.It's believed thatmotion sickness, a confusion about acceleration,is similar to the effects caused by theconsumption of poisonous plants,in which case vomiting can save your life.Pregnant rats taken to spacegive birth to babies back on earth thatstruggle with directions.Unlike rat babies that gestated here on earth,the ones that gestated in space havetrouble writing themselves when throwninto water.They do tend to be better at processingorientations common duringweightlessness,which is a good sign for humans gestated,born and raised in space, but it's some of the onlygood news. Vestibular fluid isn't theonly fluid to be affected by a zero-Genvironment.All of your body fluids are. Onearth, gravity pulls those fluids down, but inorbit, the fluid is free to evenly distribute,giving astronauts their characteristicbird legs and puffy faces.Cosmetically it's kind of a bummer.And all of that new fluid pressure in your facecan compromise vision. Of 27astronauts studied after long spaceflightsnine had fluid expansion around the optic nerve,6 had eyeballs flattened in the back by fluid pressureand four had bulging optic nerves.More fluid pressure in your head causes an errant messagethat your body must have too much fluid.So the bodies of zero-G travelersrespond byproducing less blood. Astronauts can loseup to 22 percent of their total bloodvolumewhile in space, leading to weakeratrophied hearts.Away from Earth's protection,radiation from the Sun, and the rest of the universe,is incredibly dangerous and we're stillnot exactly sure how to best guardagainst it.Mice exposed to levels of radiationexpected during interplanetary journeysshowed signs of different brain bloodflow and larger plaques of the typefound in patientswith Alzheimer's.Psychologically,feelings of isolation in space,thinking about just how far away you arefrom the rest of humanitycan affect you physically. Scientistsworking at the South Pole have developedcompromised immune systemswith fewer T-cells.As for the shape of your body,fully grown astronauts in orbit, no longer presseddown by earth typical g-force experiencespinal expansion, sometimes growing by asmuch as 3 percentbefore they come back to Earth.A 6-foot-tall humancan go to space and come back as a 6-foot 2-inch tallperson. Without usual and necessary stress,bones in space atrophy at a rate ofabout one percentper month.Given enough time, total bone masslost can be as high as 40 to 60 percent.And when weightless, you don't need asmuch muscle strength tomove around. This causes the muscles ofpeople weightless in space to atrophy.Those that you use to fight gravity canshrink 5 percent per month,for total muscle mass loss of 20 percent.It's all kind of scary and sad.But don't bother crying over it, because without 1G to pull them down,tears don't work the same way in space.Astronaut Chris Hadfield makes excellentvideos about how things happendifferentlyin orbit. For instance, tears just poolupon your face due to surface tension.In space you can cry, but as he says,the tears don't fall.We know that these problems exist foradults in space.Theoretically they would affectdeveloping children in space even more so.Parallels have been drawn between theway a child skeleton would likelydevelop inorbit and diseases that cause weakand soft bones here on earth.Bones that break and healaccording to different forces than thetypical downward ones,like Rickets. It's tenable to say thatwithout proper precautions,exercise and care, like adult astronauts already take,children developing in space could look like this.Not because of Rickets or a lack of vitamin D,but because the usual forces and activeuse required for healthy bonedevelopmentjust wouldn't be there.Added to the other threats,imagine a body shaped like this but withthinner legs, thin, weak muscles, a puffierface, poor eyesight and a higher thanusual proclivity to dementia laterin life.Doesn't sound very good, does it?Remember though that a lot of thisis speculation.Few studies have been done on the topicand few are planned for the future.We don't even know if a healthy fetus candevelop in the first placeor if conception can even occur in space.When I think about how little we knowabout our bodiesand how our bodies might grow anddevelop in the largeruniverse beyond earth, I like to think aboutplankton.These little guys live in the oceanand they exist in staggering numbers.Many varieties are too small to even see individually,but collectively they can be seen from space.It's estimated that there are moreplankton in the oceans of Earththan there are stars in our galaxy.More plankton onEarth than there are galaxies in the observableuniverse.And these guyswonder around at the whim of ocean currents.They're wanderers. In fact, they get theirname from the Greek word forwanderer, a name that they share with objectsseen wondering in the sky.Planets.Plankton on a planet.Wandererson a wanderer.Maybe,like ocean plankton, we humans aredestined to wander far and wideeventually also becoming more numerous than the starsin our galaxy.It's within the realm of what we can achieve.But before we start feeling too excited, too proud,keep in mind that we know very littleabout how our bodies grow and developoutside of this wanderer, this planet.And even though we know a lot of olderwords that sound like body,fundamentally we don't even know why wecall these thingsbodies in the first place.And as always, thanks for watching.",

This is a completely stillimage but as your eye reads well I'msaying and jumps from word to word,the paragraph will appear to slightly, justsubtly, wave and boil. The allusion is called anomalousmotion. It's neat. But to say it's funis tautology because the wordillusion literally means to have fun,to mock, to play with. But illusions aren'tjust fun and games. They also teach usabout our brains. Anomalous motion,for instance, demonstrates that our brains processthings at different rates and piece by piece.After a saccade, a quick eye movement, higher contrastelements are perceived sooner than lower contrastones. When arranged in just the right way,this delay is exploitedand your visual system only has one explanation.Low contrast parts of the imagedidn't get processed laterbecause this myelinated machine iswrong but rather because the imageitselfmust be moving. Akiyoshi Kitaoka's brilliant\"Out of focus\" causes nearby neurones todisagree about the little slices theyeach detect. Some see big changesafter a saccade and some see hardly any.This makes it difficult for our brainsto calculate and factor in the effectof our own eye movements, so the image itselfappears to be moving. But illusions aren't just aboutmoving. They can also bemoving, poignant, significant,practical. They can mean the differencebetween life and death,like in nature or during World War Ias dazzle paint on ships.This form of camouflage doesn't conceal the objectbut rathermakes it difficult for an enemy to ascertain its prey'strue shape and thus where it's headingor how fast it's going. In 1955the Soviet Union displayed their newBison and Bear long-range bombersat an air show. It looked like they hada lot. Afraid of falling behind, the USramped up production on their ownB-52 bomber. But the whole thingwas an illusion. In the Soviet's film of the air showthe same few planes had been flownpast the camera multiple timesin formations that gave the illusion ofthem having more bombersthan they really did. By the end of the1950s the Soviet Uniononly had about 150 long-range bombers,whereas the Americans, fooledby the illusion, had built nearly 2,000at a cost of 900 million dollars.Architecture is full of examples of real-world practicaloptical illusions. My favorite are Disney castles.They appear huge but it'sforced perspective - a lie. The topsappear further away from us because they are actuallyquite tiny.Illusions also tell us about ourselves culturally.The M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion is classic.The horizontal lines are all the samelength but the bottom onesappear longer to people from Western cultures,familiar with our rules of perspectiveand man-made straight lines.However, bushmen fromSouthern Africa and tribespeoplefrom northern Angola or the Ivory Coast aren'tfooled at all. Akiyoshi Kitaokais using optical illusions to discover glaucomaearlier than current techniques can. Andanamorphic illusions are used to save lives.They look weird from any perspective but one,from which they seem to pop outdefying the environment's actual shape.Hoping to remind drivers to always pay attentiontraffic safety organizations inWest Vancouver, Canada placed a skeweddecal on the road. From the right perspective,the perspective of the driver in this case,it becomes a 3D illusion of a childyou are about to hit.Slow down. Brusspub has made someincredible examples of the 3D effectsuch illusions can happen.This object? Just an anamorphic projection.Anamorphic illusions have alsobeen used to safely practicepolitical dissent.In 1746supporters of the Stuart claim to the British thronehad to be quiet about it. It was treasonous.So, sympathizers served things ontrays that looked like this.Innocuous enough until only supporterswere around.And it was safe for someone to place a reflectivegoblet or cylinder on the tray,revealing the tray's anamorphic secret ahidden portraitof their elicit love, Charles Edward Stuart himself.The Encyclopedia Titanica lists descriptionsof everybody recovered from the Titanic.It's quite macabre. Why was the icebergnot seen until it was too late?And why did the nearest ship - the Californian -not come to the Titanic's rescue sooner?Tragic questions whose answers might beopticalillusions. The Titanic was sailing through conditionsperfect for mirages.This theory points out that the Titanic sankat the border of the warmer Gulf Streamand the frigid Labrador Current,where the normal case of cooler air at higher altitudeswas inverted - a thermal inversion.Now, because the temperature of aireffects its index of refraction,a thermal inversion means light bendingin a typical ways. If light reaches the eyefrom higher up than usual, objects can appear to float.Seriously. Like this ship off the coast of Australia.A thermal inversion can also renderobjects completely unrecognizable,hidden within a haze, like this ship(?)Or like an iceberg.Or a sinking ship in need of help.The Delboeuf illusion may be causingteeth to split and crack more often than they shouldwhen dentists drill holes in them.Doctor Robert O'Shea observed8 practicing dentists and found thatthey were all drilling holesthat were too big, even though they knew the correct sizeto be drilling.Why? Well, it may be the same reason peopleeat more food when they're given a bigger plate.Objects appear smaller when enclosed by larger areas.Holes of the same size may appeardifferent sizes on biggerteeth. Dentists may be deciding that correctly sizedholes drilled in the teeth need to be made larger,not because they do, but because perceptionis a tricky thing.Illusions affect not only big ships andteeth but also your future.The End of History Illusion is ourtendency to think of ourselves todayas somehow done.Sure.I went through a lot of personal growthand changes in tastein the past, but today, who I am now,this is pretty much the final me.But that's not true.Studies have consistently shown thatpeople underestimate just howdifferent they will be, say, 10 years in the future,even though they can easily point outhow much they've changedsince 10 years ago.I like how Daniel Tomasulo puts it:\"We believe we are going to live, love,and long for where, who,and what we are thinking aboutright now.But the research says it just ain't so.This too is a transient state.\"Yogi Berra put it even more succinctly: \"The futureain't what it used to be.\"Their adviceis don't imagine your future.Look at other people and theirexperiences instead, take their advice.Your imagination is just that, their experiencesare actual data. Well, of course,it's not that simple. Which brings us to our finalillusion: The illusion of control.Named by psychologist Ellen Langer,it's our tendency to believe we control theoutcomes of things.We demonstrably don't.It can help motivate us to not give upand, in healthy people at a healthy level, it isoptimistic self-appraisal.But it's a lie.In one study, traders in the City ofLondon's investment banks were shown agraphof a real time stock price and given threebuttons that secretly didn't do anythingto affect the price.But they were told the buttons might have an effect -try them out, see what you can do.Afterwards, the traders were asked torate how much they felt they had beenable to control the stock pricewith the useless buttons. And it turns outthe traders who reported the greatestsense of control over the stock pricewere the ones who scored loweston risk management testsand, in the real world, contributed the leastto their company's profits and in terms of salarymade the least money.It's kind of a bummer.The illusion of control is a nice feelingbut sometimes it's fine,sometimes it even pays handsomely to admityou don't have control.And as always,thanks for watching.",

   "transcription": "hey Vsauce Michael here and bananas arefantastic they're actually one of themost radioactive foods we regularly eatsometimes they're difficult to peel fromthe top one of my favorite ways to avoidthat is to simply hold the banana andsnap it in half boom now it peels itselfit's a wonderful little trick exceptwhen you drop it on the ground this isunfortunate but if I picked it upquickly would it be safe enough to eat Imean how quickly do the bacteria on thefloor move on to the food some peoplecall it the five-second rule others the10-second rule and still others thetwo-second rule but is there any truthto it or is it just something that wesay to allow us to eat food off thefloor in 2003 Jillian Clark famouslyinvestigated this question she foundthat 50% of men used the five-secondrule to eat food off the ground but 70%of women do more importantly she foundthat even brief contact with acontaminated floor will contaminate foodwet or dry the mythbusters found similarresults and a paper published in thejournal of applied microbiology got evenmore technicalthe researchers contaminated variousfloor surfaces with salmonella and theyfound that five seconds is way too longto wait bacteria adhere to dropped foodalmost immediately but time does matterafter five seconds they found that thefood had acquired anywhere from 150 to8000 bacteria but if left for a fullminute the number they found was 10times greaternow considering it only takes about tenbacteria of certain strains ofSalmonella to infect you you shouldprobably think twice before eating offthe ground oh and don't complacentlythink that you're safe because the floorlooks clean or the food that fell on itdoes floors make great homes forbacteria also floors come in contactwith the bottoms of our shoes and theUniversity of Arizona has found that 93%of our shoesare contaminated with fecal bacteriaI've linked all of these studies down inthe description they're great reads verythorough but is it true that fooddropped on a dirty floor becomescontaminated immediately I mean shortpractically speaking that makes a lot ofsense but instantly is there a limit tohow quickly bacteria can move from oneobject to another is there an amount oftime short enough that were I to pickthe food up within it there would be noway for what it touched to contaminateit well we're going to need to definetouch I've talked about this before onVsauce and on thinker and minutephysicshas a great quantum perspective but whenwe say touch we tend to think of twoobjects contacting each other with nospace in between unfortunately that'snot really what happens at a subatomiclevel atoms resists smashing togetherbecause their electrons repel electronscan be modeled as waves waves thatoverlap and interact but they nevertouch there's always space between themwhen I touch something or someone I'mreally just feeling their electronsreact to mine at a distance a subatomicLi small one but a real one so if that'sthe case how come glue can stick thingstogetherhow come lipstick sticks to lips and howcan bacteria on a dirty floor stick tofood that's been dropped on it thepositive charge from the protons in anatom or molecule isn't always balancedperfectly in space by the negativecharge from electrons sometimes amolecule is asymmetrical and thisimbalance is permanent which gives themolecule a constant dipole so it's likea tiny little magnet but even insymmetrical molecules electrons aremobile at any one point in time theymight happen to find themselves moretowards one end of a molecule than theother creating rapidly fluctuatingdipoles causing the moleculeto act like a magnet if molecules have alot of energy they will simply whiz byone another and their dipoles and thoseof their neighbors won't matter much butif you cool them down slow them down thedipoles will have more of an effectwhich is why molecules tend to sticktogether as they cool going from a gasto a liquid to a solid that's a lot ofinformation about molecules but it'sincredibly important it's the reasonthings can get wet in fact when you getout of the shower you on average weighabout one pound more than you did beforeyou got wet it's also the reasoncapillary action happens if you dip anapkin in a glass of wateryou can watch the water climb up thenapkin against gravity that's becausethe molecules of water have very strongdipoles and they're attracted to eachothercohesion and they're attracted to themolecules of the paper adhesion morestrongly than gravity pulls them down ifyou want to learn more aboutintermolecular forces I've put a bunchof links down in the description buthere's my question how quickly do thoseforces act can two surfaces come intocontact briefly enough that theirmolecules don't have time to beinfluenced by intermolecular forces wellfor this we're going to need moleculardynamics molecular dynamics is thecomputer simulation of the physicalmovements of atoms or molecules forinstance this is a simulation of asingle copper atom depositing on acopper surface notice that the timer upthere is counting off hundredths of apicosecond these simulations need tohave a narrow enough time step toaccount for the fastest molecularvibrations of the material includingeverything from wagging to scissoringtypically time as brief as a quadrillionof a second is taken into account so thefive-second rule may be trueif we rename it the one femtosecond rulespend less time on the floor than thatand it's unlikely that room temperaturemolecules would have time to beinfluenced by intermolecular forcesexcept oops I think we've been thinkingtoo smallintermolecular forces are fun butobjects can become entangled with eachother on a macroscopic level glue andmakeup and other sticky stuff often takeadvantage of the tiny imperfectionsridges and nooks and crannies on anobject's surface sticky things can seepinside and hold oneven surfaces that seem smooth to uswhen you really get down to it aren'tsmooth at all two sheets of paper from aphone book may slide across each otherquite easily but multiply that frictionby the number of pages in two phonebooks by interleaving the pages andyou've got yourself a monster capable oflifting an entire car I was recentlylucky enough to see this happen in reallife you can check out my adventure overon fast furious and funny it's a newchannel stay tuned because we liftedcars with more than just phone books theadhesion between two objects caused bythese shapes of their surfacescontributes to friction and is known asmechanical adhesion it plays a prettybig role in getting floor germs to stickto dropped food in fact if two surfacescan mechanically adhere but aren't closeenough to do so we wouldn't say theywere touching and so if by definitiontouching means that you can mechanicallyadhere to the other object's surfacewell then maybe the five-second ruleshouldn't be known as the onefemtosecond rule because if they'retouching it's already too late andinstead the rule should be known as thedon't touch food that's fallen on thefloor rule but come to think of it maybewe shouldn't be eating food that'stouched anything because bacteria areeverywhere including on you right nowthere are more bacteria on your bodyright now than there are peoplein America there are 40 million bacteriain one gram of soil and five non millionbacteria on earth it's been found thatone out of every ten bankcards and oneout of every seven bills has fecalbacteria on it here's something fun godown to the comments section and typethe letter v if you used a mobile phoneto do that congratulations you justtouched six thousand two hundred andeighty one bacteria if you're using adesktop keyboard get a little safer youprobably only touched about one hundredand eightycellphones are actually one of the mostbacteria-ridden things we frequentlyencounter if you want to estimate abouthow many bacteria are specifically onyour phone based on how clean you arethe oatmeal has a really great quiz youcan find that in the description buthonestly what amazes me the most isn'thow dirty our world is or how muchbacteria there is instead it's the factthat despite those numbers we don't getsick more often our immune system isamazing but it relies on the sameprinciples of adhesion that bacteria dothe forces that cause food dropped onthe floor to pick up germs are the sameforces that we need to fight themthey're the same forces that bring uscloser together whether we like it ornotso keep adhering and as always thanksfor

since there are afinite number of tones our ears candistinguishand because it only takes a few notes incommon for two musical ideasto sound similar will we everrun out of new musicwill there ever be a day where everypossible brief little melody has beenwritten and recorded and we are leftwith nothingnew to make a good rule of thumb mightbe to say that if modern recordingtechnology can't distinguish thedifference between two songswell neither could we so let's beginthere with digital downloads mp3scds and a calculation made by coveredin bees digital musicis made out of bits lots and lots ofbitsbut each individual bit exists in one oftwo statesa zero or a one now what this meansis that for any given say five minutelong audio filethe number of possibilitiesmathematically speaking is enormousbut mind-blowingly finitea compact disc which samples music at44.1 kilohertzis going to need about 211 million bitsto store one5-minute song and because a bit canexist in two states either a 0 or a 1the number of possible different ways toarrange those 211 millionbits is 2 to the 211 millionthpower that value represents every singlepossibledifferent five-minute long audio filebut how big is that number well let'sput this in perspectivea single drop of water contains 6sextillion atoms 6sextillion is 22 digitslong it's a long number but the totalnumber of atoms that make up the entireearthis a number that is about 50 digits longand estimations of the total number ofhydrogen atomsin our universe is a number that is80 digits longbut 2 to the 211 millionth power thenumber of possibledifferent five-minute audio files is anumber that is63 milliondigits long it is a numberlarger than we can even pretendto understand it contains every possiblecd-quality 5-minute audio fileinside that amount is everything frombeethoven's fifthto beck's loser it even contains afive-minute conversation you had withyour parentswhen you were three years old in factevery one of themit even contains every possibleconversation you didn't have with yourparents when you were three years oldbut it is finite not infiniteit's cool to think about but it doesn'tcome very close to answering thequestion of this video which ishow many possible different songscan we create and hear the differencebetweenso for that we're going to need tonarrow down our hunton everything too ferrous lepidopteramade a calculationthat involved some assumptions that ithink helped narrow the field downin a really nice way she took a look atthe total number ofpossible different melodies you couldcreate within oneoctave containing any or all of theintervalswe divide octaves into of coursesound frequencies can be divided muchmore granularlythan that but giving ourselves morenotes might mean we could makemore technically different melodies butthey wouldn't necessarily sound anydifferentto our ears now given a single measurecontaining any combination of whole halfquarter eighth 16th or32nd notes she calculated that therewould bethis many possible uniquemeasures which is a smaller number thanwe had beforebut to put it in perspective thisis how many seconds oldthe universe is uric de's calculationis even more specific he stayed withinone octavebut instead of looking at a completemeasure he only considered the number ofunique combinationsof eight notes he also assumed thattypical melodies as we know them todayonly contain about three differenttypes of note length for instancequarter eighth and sixteenth or wholehalf and quarterto be sure that will most likely notalways betrue musical tastes hundreds thousandsof years from now will most assuredly bedifferent but given melodies as we knowthemtoday across eight notesover 12 intervals there are about 79billion possible combinationswe're getting relatively small here imean under this definition of melody100 songwriters creating a brand neweight note melody every secondwould exhaust every possible melodywithin only 248 yearsbut it's still a huge number way biggerthan the total number of songs that havebeen written that we know aboutso you can quite safely say that nowe will never run out of new musicbut here's the rubif that's the case why are there so manycommonalities betweensongs even across hundreds of years howcome so many songs kind ofsound the same i mean if we have morepossibilities than we could ever exhaustwhy is twinkle twinkle little star thealphabet songand baba black sheep all the same melodymy country tis of thee and god save thequeen interestingly enoughare the same song

Michael here.And subscribing to Vsauce is a no-brainer, or is it?I mean,you would need your brain to understand thewords that I was speaking, and you would needyour brain to decide whether or not you likedwhat you were hearing. You would also needyour brain to move your muscles in just theright way to click the subscribe button.In fact, you need your brain to do a lot of stuff and without a brain, well, you can't do muchof anything at all. So, literally speaking,is there really such a thing as a \"no-brainer?\"Let's begin with no-header's...decapitation.It's a macabre subject, I know, but what'sthe matter? Are you chicken? Ok, good.Because Mike certainly was. In 1945, farmer LloydOlsen went out to grab a chicken for supper.He cut the chicken's head off and it didn'tdie. Mike The Headless Chicken lived for another18 months. He toured the country and surprisedonlookers. He could walk and perch and wasfed by putting little drops of water or piecesof grain down his throat. But here's the thing.Mike The Headless Chicken's actionsweren't a no-brainer, because even thoughhe didn't have much of what we would calla \"head\" left,he did have a bit of his brain stem.If we want a clearer no-brainer, we're goingto have to look at an even more simple creature,the cockroach. These guys don't even breaththrough their heads so, without one, they'refine. Instead, they breath through holes allover their bodies. And instead of being controlledby a big, massive brain, they have littlebundles of nerves, ganglia, throughout theirbody, and so, even without any head parts,even when completely decapitated, a cockroachcan live for weeks. It can walk around, respondto movement. Really its only problem is thatwithout its head it will eventually starve to death.Us humans are not nearly as fortunate. Withouta head and brain we die within seconds, ifnot instantly. But before you get jealous,keep in mind that with our heads intact, weare capable of some actions that don't necessarilyrequire the brain: reflexes. When you snapyour finger, your finger moves at about 20mph. And a really big sneeze can expel airat nearly 30-40 mph. But nerve impulses, they'rereally quick. They can clock in at 250 mph,but sometimes, that's not even fast enough.For instance, if you accidentally put yourhand on a hot stove, cells are dying quickly.And 250 mph doesn't cut it, you need to takean action fast. It's not worth it to tellyour brain what's happening right away. Andso instead, your immediate reaction to pullaway is mediated by other parts of your nervoussystem. The same can be said for involuntaryand unconscious processes.So, in a way, these unconscious, involuntary,or reflexive behaviors could be consideredno-brainers. But I'm not quite satisfiedyet because they still require that your brainbe there, keeping you alive. So, what if youweren't alive? Well, in your dead, brainlessbody, your muscle cells still contain a littlebit of energy in the form of ATP.Backyard Brains, right here on YouTube, demonstratesthis with insect parts. This leg is no longerconnected to a brain or a body, but energyremains in the cells. And so, researcherscan detect electrical signals when the legis touched or even simply breathed on.\"Whoa, that popping sound you're hearing isthe spontaneous discharge rate of the livingneurons in the still-living leg.\"The muscle cells of a human limb would respondin just the same way. But you don't need wiresto observe behavior like this. Salt can alsodo the trick. The introduction of sodium ionscan cause a process similar to an action-potentialin a living animal. Salt added to these freshfrog legs makes them dance, though not forvery long. The cells will eventually run outof energy or simply decay. But to be sure,there are many other brief candidates forno-brainers at the moment of death. For instance,muscles relaxing, causing a person tosoil themselves. Technically, a no-brainer. Butit's a misconception that a corpse continuesto grow fingernails and hair. Instead, it'sactually the skin itself shrinking as itdries, making hair and nails appear longer.But let's take a closer look at these skin cells,because we might be on to a quite satisfactoryno-brainer. Your skin cells live on the peripheryof your body and they don't require a constantstream of new nutrients from your blood.And so even though you are dead and your brainis no longer calling the shots, your skincells can continue to live, gathering nutrientsthrough osmosis and dividing for days.In fact, you can harvest skin cells from a corpseafter 24 hours.On a related note - digestion.Sure, a lot of the digestive process is completed by youbeing alive and having a nervous system thatworks. But part of the work is done by bacteriathat just happens to live inside your gut.And when you're dead or your brain is gone,they'll continue digesting.So, in a way, making poop, at least part of that process,is a no-brainer.But here's the thing. These bacteria thatlive inside you are foreign bacteria.Are they you?For that matter, what about theskin cells that can continue to live after you're dead?Are they you or are they merely cellsthat you have made a good home for?We're getting pretty philosophical here becausewe're basically asking if you are merely yourbrain and everything else that goes on whenyou no longer have one is just other stuffthat you aren't doing?You could argue that without a brain your bodyno longer has your intentions. It no longerdoes things because you have decided to do them.In other words, a no-brainer may beimpossible for you to do,because it requires not using you.If you are merely what your brain does andnot what your cells do off on their own whenthe brain is gone then, in a way, being you,being alive, is a yes-brainer.Another great yes-brainer is checking out Vsauce3.You can find some scientific videogame analysis, some gamer L\u00dcT and some prettycool apps to download.

   "title": "Will We Ever Visit Other Stars?",
   "publishedAt": "01 Feb 2013",
   "transcription": "Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. I've been watchingBravest Warriors on Cartoon Hangover lately.It's great, it was created by Pendleton Ward,and in the show teenagers zip around the universevisiting star systems and planets and hereis my question: When will we do the same?Us humans, in real life.I mean, we've managed to put people on theMoon, and land robots on asteroids, and Mars,and even Titan, a moon of Saturn.Interplanetary travel is scary cool.But will we ever travel interstellarly? Certainlyit will happen, right? I mean, Voyager 1 isexpected to reach interstellar space sometimethis year, or maybe in the next year or two.And it was launched way back in 1977. So,shows like Bravest Warriors are pretty muchjust a glimpse of our future, maybe even onewithin our lifetimes. Right?Well, we're going to need a DONG for this one. Something youcan Do Online Now Guys.The Hayden Planetarium's digital universeallows you to explore a 3-dimensional mapof our Milky Way. Now, there are about 81visible stars within just 20 lightyears ofour own Sun. The nearest is Proximus Centauri,which is only 4.3 lightyears away.Getting there? Piece of cake. Piece of difficultcake, because a lightyear is an incrediblylong distance. It's the distance that lightin a vacuum will travel in an entire year.And in just one second light can travelso far as to circle the entire Equator ofEarth...7 times.Now, a fast bullet can travel at about 1,500 m/s.And Voyager 1 is traveling at about 17,000m/s, relative to the Sun. Also relative tothe Sun, our Earth is orbiting at a speedof 29,800 m/s - that's pretty fast.But the fastest man-made object ever was the Helios2 Solar Probe,which traveled at a maximum speed of 70,220 m/s.Impressive, right? Well, even at that speed,the fastest speed ever reached by any manmade object, crossing this little ol' gapand reaching Proximus Centauri would take19,000 years.But technology in the future is bound to beimproved, along with the maximum speeds weare able to obtain. Even using what we knownow, a solar sail could easily provide theacceleration needed to reach near-lightspeed speeds.And our current understanding of physics theoreticallyallows for things like wormholes which, intheory, could move a spacecraft from one pointin space to another faster than light normally could.And who could forget the famous Alcubierre drive?An idea that fits within most modelsof our universe, and proposes a way to delivera space craft to a distant object faster thanlight can get there - not by moving the spacecraft,but, instead, by collapsing and expandingspace itself.Things like wormholes and Alcubierre drivesare theoretical, but if they could one daybecome a reality, how far away might that day be?It matters. And figuring out exactlywhen in time we should begin an interstellarjourney is called a Wait Calculation. Leavetoo soon and before a ship launched today,full of frozen embryos, ever got to its destinationit would be passed by astronauts who lefthundreds, or thousands, of years later, ata point in time when technology was advancedenough to lap what we have today.Andrew Kennedy calculated that given thepace of our progress, as far as travel velocityis concerned,and Earth's mean annual economic growth,the soonest human civilization might everreach Bernard Star, 6 lightyears away, is1,104 years from today, which isn't withinany of our lifetimes. It might also be a bitoptimistic because it assumes that we notonly solve the problem of speed, but thatwe also solve problems like \"how to surviveinterstellar radiation for years?\" or \"howto avoid collisions with interstellarmaterial at high speeds?\"It also assumes that before we achieve thetechnology needed to successfully interstellarlytravel, all of human kind isn't wiped outby some cataclysmic natural disaster. It maysound unlikely, but we're not talking aboutthe near-future, we're talking about thousandsof years from now. Let's put it this way.Even given our current, slow means of spacetravel, it's estimated that within 5 to 50 millionyears, we could theoretically explore andcolonize our whole galaxy.That's a lot of time, though. In fact, statisticallyspeaking, within the next 500,000 years, it'svery likely that Earth will encounter a meteoritenearly a kilometer across. Hopefully whenthat happens we have the prevention abilitiesneeded to keep ourselves safe. But givenall of this information it's easy to see whythe 2008 Joint Propulsion Conference concludedthat it was improbable that humans would everexplore beyond the solar system.It's quite depressing to think that sceneslike this one from Shutterstock may be destinedto only ever remain that - science fiction.Wait, how quickly is the camera moving inthat clip? We're used to seeing science fictionscenes like this, but a Nebula tends to belightyears across, which means that in thisclip we're traveling at least the speed oflight, if not faster.Would it really look like that?I covered this briefly in my black hole video,but not completely. If you were to travelat the speed of light, or near the speed oflight, the universe ahead of you wouldn'tlook like it usually did. First of all, yourfield of view would increase. It would appearas if the universe was receding away fromyou as you accelerated. At the same time,all of the light reaching you would be blueshifteduntil you were left with this. You may haveseen this on Vsauce 2. It's the cosmic backgroundradiation blueshifted all-the-way up intothe visible range.MIT Game Lab offers a free, downloadable gamethat puts you in an environment where thespeed of light can be lowered all-the-waydown to typical walking speed. You can experienceall of the visual effects I just discussed,but I wanted to know what it would look likeif the speed of light was where it is, andI took a journey from Earth to the Moon.So, I enlisted my friend Liam from World ofthe Orange and New Music to put together asimulation of what it might actually looklike to accelerate to nearly the speed oflight and then slow down,during a trip from Earth to the Moon. Enjoy.Whether or not you should believe that allthe right factors will come together and humanswill one day travel that quickly or reachinterstellar destinations largely comes downto whether you want to be an optimist or apessimist. But what we've accomplished sofar is quite amazing considering how weak,flimsy and vulnerable the human body is inthe vacuum of space.Bad Astronomer and SciShow have great videosdiscussing this topic. And now, thanks tothe brilliant team at Bravest Warriors, I'mgoing to go to space. But not while wearinga Vsauce suit, no, no, no, I'll do it naked.Whoa. Ok, not that naked. And also maybe somemuscles?Yep, so that's pretty much what I'd look like.The moment I'm exposed to the vacuum of spacemy body would not inflate and explode. Now,the body is a very nicely contained system.But those parts of me that aren't well contained...they'llbe the first to go. The air in my lungs anddigestive tract would quickly rush out. Moist,soft tissues would rapidly lose water.My mouth and lips and eyes would dry out andswell. As water was pulled to the surfaceof these things it would vaporize, and thedecrease in its pressure would cool my mouthand eyes to near-freezing. My body would inflateto about twice its normal size as gasses inmy blood came out of solution, slowly evaporatingaway, cooling the surface of my skin.Oh, and the blood vessels in my eyes would likelyburst, spilling blood into my eyes which,along with all the other fluid in my eyes,would be rapidly vaporizing on the surface,freezing and drying them out.Within about 15 seconds I would go unconsciousbecause oxygen wasn't reaching my brain. And,as far as I'm concerned, that would be theend of the entire ordeal. For another 90 secondsor so I would still, technically, be alive,but I wouldn't be aware of it or rememberany of it. My dead body would remain, internally,quite warm for a while because in the nearvacuum of space there isn't much matter toconduct of convect heat away from me. Instead,I would really only lose heat through radiation,a much less efficient method. It would takehours for me to cool down to the temperatureof space, and by then, I would be nothingbut a dried-up piece of slightly bloated andstretched, dessicated human jerky.If I was exposed to the Sun's full-on radiation,not filtered by the usual atmosphere of Earth,I would be a grossly sunburnt piece of jerky.In case that makes you hungry, let me giveyou some nutritional facts: 200 pounds ofhuman meat, in outer space, would eventuallybecome about 120 pounds of freeze-dried jerky.And given what would be left of me that wouldbe edible as a snack, I'd be worth about 115,000calories.Maybe humans are the only intelligent lifein the universe. But if you believe that intelligentlife could have arisen on other planets,an interesting idea occurs: The Fermi Paradox.Enrico Fermi calculated that given the numberof planets believed to exist in our galaxy,at least some of them must have been habitableto life as we know it. And, in many cases,millions and millions of years before lifeon Earth even existed.So, if interstellar travel, traveling betweenstars and different solar systems, reallyis possible for intelligent life to do, whyhave we not been visited by aliens yet? Well,maybe we have been visited. Maybe they'rehere right now and we just can't perceivethem. Or maybe we haven't been discovered.Or maybe we are alone. Or maybe we're justnot worth visiting...So, what are you waiting for? Live your lifein a way that makes traveling lightyears justto hang out with you worth it.And as always,thanks for watching.",

about seven and ahalf billion of us and that's a lot butremember that that many human bodiesthrown together into one big pile wouldbarely fill the Grand Canyon this is allof us in one place the physical bulk ofall living human flesh on earth todaywould only make a cone about 7,000people tall and 2,000 across that's itbut that's a three-dimensional shapewhat if we made a one-dimensionalsingle-file line of people each with say1 meter of room and we stretched thataround the planet well we would make itall the way around and still have 99.5percent of the human population left ifwe made a circle that included everyonethe ring of people would be more than2.4 million kilometers in diameterdwarfing the orbit of our own moon nowthat's not just a circle that is a sircool let's talk about circles todayspecifically something that they do rollbut what is rolling well rolling occurswhenever something moves with respect tosomething else and is always in contactwith that something else and the contactpoints have instantaneous velocities ofzero that is there's no sliding inmathematics the path traced by a pointon a rolling object is called a rouletteFrench four little wheel the centre of adisk produces a roulette that's just asmooth straight line while rolling ononeand this is why disks are good wheels asquare on the other hand would be bumpybut square centers can make straightsmooth Roulettesacross the right surfaces this is theprinciple behind square wheels which Irecently had the pleasure of enjoying atthe Museum of mathematics in New YorkCity Stan wagon wrote a fantastic andfamous article about wheels which I'velinked down in the description belowit's a great read he also contributed afantastic interactive tool to theWolfram demonstration project thatallows you to build a wheel and thenfind the corresponding road shape thatallows it to roll smoothly the roulettetraced by a point on a disk as it rollson a straight line has a special nameit's called a trochoidal Greek word forreal TRO Coase now trochoidal prolatedepending on whether the tracing pointis inside or outside the circumferenceif the point is on the circumference theresulting curve is called a cycloidcycloids are very special and they arethe star of this episode now I've beenworking with Adam Savage a lot lately aswe gear up for brain candy live our 40city tour that I hope to see you atrecently I asked Adam for some help withrillettes Adam give a favorite polygonyou can't they're like your children yougot a favorite eye I don't have afavorite either I do have a favoritething that you can do with the polygonokay make a cyclic on a cyclic cyclic onis an actual actual thing it's an actualthing do have a polygon around herehere this this here's a squid rightright say this is a square yeahif I take one of the vertexes of thissquid and I start rolling this squareand you follow where that vertex ohshootlet me roll this better are you readyyeah all right the actual pathit describes a curve described here yeahthat curve is called a cyclic on and asyou pick polygons with more and moresides you get closer and closer to whatI want from you today okay a cycloid acycloid now I I could have just donethis in Photoshop and done like ananimation like I normally do but youhave a shop we can actually build andyou can build the bit okay why did Iwant to build a cycloid well let me askyou this with only gravity to move youwhat's the fastest way to roll or slidefrom a point to some other point belowbut not directly below would it be astraight line well that would certainlybe the shortest path but when you fallgravity accelerates you and fallingvertically a lot right away would meanhaving a higher top speed during more ofthe journey and that can more than makeup for the fact that a path like this ismuch longer than a straight line but ofthese two considerations acceleratequickly and don't have too long of apath what's the optimal combinationfinding the answer the path of leasttime is called the brick east a chromeproblem and it's been around for a whileGalileo thought the answer was a paththat's just a piece of a circle but hewas wrong there's a better one and in1697 Johann Bernoulli came up with theanswer using a very clever approach tosee how he solved it let's start with asimilar problem you are standing in somemud and you want to run to a ball in thestreet as quickly as possible now astraight line would be the path ofshortest distance but if you can run onpavement much faster than you can run inmud the path of shortest time would beone in which you spend less time movingslowly in mud and more timeon the surface your bast on the angleyou should enter the pavement at dependson how fast you move on both surfaces asit turns out when the ratio between thesigns of these two angles equals theratio between your speeds across bothsurfaces the resulting path will be theoptimal quickest route this is calledSnell's law light always obeys Snell'slaw when it changes speeds like when itleaves a material in which it moves moreslowly like water and enters one inwhich it moves more quickly like air italways refract according to Snell's lawin other words light always follows theroute that is the fastest for it to takeBernoulli used this fact to tackle thebrick ista chrome problem light changingspeed is analogous to a falling objectchanging speed but of course a fallingobject doesn't just speed up once itsspeed is always increasing itsaccelerating to mimic this using lightwhich Bernoulli knew would always showhim the fastest possible route all hehad to do was add more and more thinnerand thinner layers in which the speed oflight was faster and faster and fasterand well what do you know there it isthe brick East a chrome curve the pathof least time roll down a track likethis and you will beat anything rollingdown any other path every time Bernoulliwas clever enough to realize that thiscurve can be described in another way asa roulette specifically he noticed thatit was a cycloid the path traced by apoint on a circle rolling along a line acycloid satisfies Snell's law everywhereto see why I highly recommend watchingthis video on the brick East a chromeproblem this channel is fantastic by theway I'm a huge fan the visuals andexplanations are top-notch anyway acycloid provides the perfect balancebetween keeping the journey distanceshort and picking up speed early now Itold Adam all of thisand I told him that it would be reallyfun to have a cycloid curve we couldroll things down and he said clearly weshould start building we should juststart building it what we need is acircle okay that's a the height that wewant mm-hmm and then we're going to usethat circle to trace a night cycloidcurve I want to do a race right so yeahyeah look if we're gonna do like if youhave point a here and point B here andyou say that there's some kind of curvethat's better than a straight line interms of something traveling betweenthose two then I want to also make astraight line from A to B yeah and maybealso a really extreme curve like thatright okay got some protractors thereyou have a compass extension I do I haveall sorts of I've never seen such thingis that it yeah that connects to thatgive or take I almost am I feel guiltythat this is like a dream of mine comingtrue oh really but it's such a nerdydream too it's not like I want this youknow Red Ryder BB gun it's like I justwant to curve that things roll downokay so then clearly when we're donewith this this is this is my Christmaspresent to youI think I'm currently like working out away to do this in my head that actuallymakes it fairly compact and not supernot super complicated yeah take a bladeand cut out like an inch around thewhole thing[Music]how are you gonna do the finishing I'mgoing to cut this unless you would liketo on the band's you can start okay[Music]okay now that's a little bit rough sowe're gonna finish it on my disc sanderoh wowthat's close enough it's pretty goodyeah so now you want to use this to drawa psych psych Lloyd yeah so you'll needa little hole that's what yeah so thatthe point of our drawing implement is onthe rim not above it I'm doing thisright inside I don't think so it isthat's even better than having the rimhole because we want the line to beright on the edge okay so what we'regonna do is we're gonna create a patternfor the cycloid curve that I'm thengoing to transfer to acrylic to clearacrylic regular right allow us to seethings really clearly yeah this allowsyou right roller sight because we'rejust doing it it's literally like thatright oh yeah see this is perfect yeahpushed against here I shouldn't slipthis is like a Ouija board for geometrynerdsit is a Ouija board for geometry nerdsokay there we gothat's smooth out Ricci stack ronethat's that's that's the curve thatwe're talking about yeah that's thebeginning that's the end and this is ourpattern yeah cool that's coolokay so I'm gonna end up with let's say3/4 of an inch thick but it's gonna havechannels table saw it out of it mm-hmmtravel its length and in those channelswill sit my clear acrylic acrylic curvesand it'll also have an uprightthat also will have the channels milledout of it on the table soft and that'llallow the curve to sit and be supportedyeah a little backstop here easily atthe bottom that will allow us to hearthat they all hit at the same timethere's a couple things going on one isis that we've got cycloid straight lineand then we've got extreme curve rightand are these you had mentioned bendingthe acrylic so we could adjust the nomagically I have this is you like thisthe acrylic will just be a thin ofacrylic just a thin sheet of ittraveling on that will be and I havematerial for this some Delrin or acetylrollers that look like this so from theside they'll look like this they'll looklike an H ah huh in which the acrylicsits in there and the roller isself-supporting on the acrylic but rollsdownah that is tolerance love itI like those curves while Adam and Ibuild a real-life cycloid track let'stake some time to appreciate other kindsof Roulettes as mentioned beforetrochoidal anon straight lines but anepitome oi is made when a disk rollsaround the outside of a circle roll adisk inside a circle and what you'vemade is a hypo trochoidal names for thecurves you make when using a spirographtoy notice that the holes don't lie onthe circumference of the disks thoughsome do come close there's a specialname for epic rock woods and hypotrochoidalan algis to disks rolling on straightlines they are epicycles and hypocycloids now if two circles have thesame radius a point on the rolling onewill touch the stationary one exactlyonce always in the same spot creating acusp this cute heart-shaped epicycle IDis also known as a cardioid if therolling circle has half the largersradius you'll get a 2 cusped epicyclicthe shape of which is called a nephritebecause it apparently looks like akidney I guess 1/3 the radius gives youthree cusps 1/4 four cusps and so on asfor hypo cycloids if the inner circlesradius is 1/4 of the larger x' theresulting Roulette curve is called anasteroid because it looks like a starwhich the ancients also thought aboutasteroids 1/3 the radius and you've gota deltoid named after its resemblance tothe Greek letter Delta 1/2 the radiusand well you get a straight line thisfun relationship is called a 2 C couplerotational motion turned into linearmotion follow a number of points on therolling circle and you'll get the famousillusion where every individual pointmoves in a straight line but the wholething describes a rolling circle put ahandle on itand you've built a trammel of Archimedesaka an ellipse a graph when used toellipses AKA a hillbilly entertainmentcenterwhen bought in Osceola Missouri anywaylet's get back to Adam and eyes curvecomparison build okay okay there's yourfinish line you ready I'm readyall right I'll count us down three twoone go okay here we go3 2 1 go 1 2 3 with the asleep wassecond straight was last straight waslast the shortest distance between twopoints was last slowest way to get thereyeah it certainly was let's try it onemore time yep because it was super closethe brick ista Crone curve was by farthe winner yeah what a mouthful of aname by the way barista drunk East uhCrone but Keith's brick east across notrelated to the brachiosaur looked at ourthat's I once looked up the differencebetween ingenious and ingenuity and theydon't have them and they're not relatedno all right now ready I'm ready3 2 1 goyeah same results same result1 2 these are so close it's hard to tell[Music]well we're answering the main questionwhich is that the barista chrome curveis the fastest way to get there well abrick easter chrome curve is also knownas a tata chrome curve that has anotherproperty that's that we should testwhat's it and that is it's all you knowhold up before you get to this we'veestablished between these three curvesthat the cycloid made brick easterchrome curve is by far the fastest it'sby far the fast okay great you get steepand unfortunately you pick up a lot ofspeed right away but then you've got alot of this with little acceleration yepyou go straight down and you know funnyenough you what you want is that perfectbalance of gravities acceleration butalso moving to where you need to be andthat is asked that's fascinating to methat a geometry which is the cycloidcurve would yield such an efficientexploitation of the forces involved yeahexactlybecause if there was no acceleration ifthere was just one force in thebeginning straight-line would probablybe the fastest right okay what is theother quality of the Tata chrome curveyou just said itTata chrome means same time so as thegeometry and math tells us no matterwhere you start an object yeahwhat whoops the clamp city it was myfault but also come on clamp no itsector you know how to do these tablesare a pain in the ass because they havethese lips on them and they actuallythat's like it's it's actually my faultso I'm gonna remove the straight lineguy as well so we're left with a cycloidwhich is called a brick East a Cronecurve but it also has a bizarre propertywhere no matter where I start an objecton it when I let go they always reachthe bottom in the same amount of timewait a second so if I started here theamount of time it takes for this to getto the endis the same amount of time it takes forit to get to the end from hereyeah and the same from right here wellWow okay so starting from here it'sgonna be tough because of friction yeahnow if you do this in software it'sperfect but that's boring yeah this isthe real world and maybe we won't startthe network I mean if we do one two andthree yeah are we actually I feel likewe could probably we could probably getone to work from here like that theremight be a lot of friction involved butlook at always see we can always seewe've got enough of them that's why wemade three curves so we can test thisproperty and these were all cut andsanded clamped together so they areincredibly similar I will have to tamperthe edge as I did on this one yeah alittle known fact that once you've tornpaper off of Plexiglas it crumples intoa really nice wall to be thrown longdistances a Plexiglas in the first placeI've never seen it happen because itdoesn't really feel glued I think thisis I hope that's cool because in theoryand practice theory in theory theory andpractice are the same thing but inpractice I went to the University ofChicago where one of their singswell that sounds good in practice how isit in theory hahahaha life of the mindthere so let us see if you do if I doone up here and you do one there andokay yes so this has got to be withoutthis I think the same person shouldrelease them because then okay I'm itbetter so here put that one here okayall right so three different positionsthree this one has longer to go yep thisone has the shortest path so who's gonnareach the bottom first okay here we golet's see would you wish it would saythe one in might this one yeah go firstready yeah good pretty good that wasawesome that was so they all ended upthey lined right up alright let's dolet's let's switch it up okay even Ithink you're gonna be the one to releasethem yeah otherwise it won't be easy totime here we go three two one I'd begarnish them lining up yeah they line uplike they're waiting for each other I'mgonna stand further away cuz I want tosee the full path okay ready yeah threetwo one how cool is that they totallyline up to hit at about the sameperiodicity they went for here so giventhe vagaries of some extra frictionshere and there there they're actuallyhitting this at the same sort ofperiodicity that they are when theystart at the same point so there's thatand then[Music]is this some is this the Tata chromecurved demonstration ring of your dreamsit really is it is it's also the brickEaster Kron rig of my dreams and thecycloid rig of my dreams so check that Ikeep doing that yeah that is really coolanother one

kilometers away thefamous Blue Marble but what does Earthreally look like well it depends on howyou define look the word look comes fromthe old breton word Lagoon meaning I thehuman eye and that's part of the problemimages like this are based on lighthumans can see but we don't seeeverything there's a fantastic episodeof radio lab that uses sound toillustrate just how different othercreatures visual spaces are from our ownwhen we talk about the way somethingphysically looks we are talking aboutthe visual perception of emitted orreflected electromagnetic radiationspecifically visible light light weperceive as red has a longer wavelengththan blue or violet but what if I crankthe wavelength even shorter does it stopbeing light no it just becomes light youcan't see ultraviolet x-rays gamma raysgoing the other wayyou get infrared microwaves and finallyradio waves in principle the spectrum ofpossible electromagnetic wavelengths isinfinite but even within the range ofwavelengths we observe the breath isbreathtaking if the entire practicalspectrum of wavelengths was laid outlinearly from New York to Los Angelesthe visual portion we see would only bethe size of 100 nanometers small enoughto slip through a surgical mask point iswhen it comes to what there is to seeour eyes miss out on a lot for instancetake a look at a remote control many ofthese things communicate with light ofwavelengths we can't see but mobilephone cameras can try this at homepush a button on a remote control andyou won't see much but use a mobilephone camera to detect wavelength so youcan't see and have the rendered visiblethere's a whole lot going on we miss outon our night sky is full of frequencieswe can't see with our eyes alone butchroma scope net allows you to extendyour vision this is the Milky Way as wesee it the visible light it gives offbut slide to see how it would look atour eyes sensed other frequencies ofcourse we are having to represent theseother frequencies with visible

there's anotherproblem with the Blue Marble it's flatand the earth is three-dimensional aglobe is the best way to represent theearth but globes are difficult to carryaround and even when displayed in

tastelike what does the human palate preferinterestingly of all the possiblecombinations of identified flavors weconsume human cuisine only features arelatively small numberof recipes a couple years ago scientificreports published a great paper on thechemistry and networks behind foodpairing researchers took 381 ingredientsused in 5 global cuisines and 1021molecular compounds known to contributeto their flavors and created a flavornetwork the size of the bubblerepresents the ingredients prevalence incooking the thickness of the linesconnecting ingredients reflects thenumber of flavor inducing molecules theysignificantly share the researchersflavor Network backbone spans 14different food categories and is quiteinteresting by comparing this network totens of thousands of recipes they foundthat North American and Western Europeandishes tend to combine ingredients thatshare flavor compounds while East Asiancuisine avoids them but that trend wascaused by a few outliers in each cuisinethat if ignored caused the difference inamount of sharing to lessen those fewingredients tend to be the mostauthentic they tend to be the mostresponsible for the taste palate of aregional cuisine and contribute to thisilluminating visualization but someflavours don't go together in anycuisine for instance orange juice andtoothpastewhy does orange juice taste sodisgusting right after brushing wellmost toothpastes contain sodium laurylsulfate a chemical that helps the pasteget sudsy and frothy during use thataction helps pull brushed off debrisaway from your teeth but sodium laurylsulfate also suppresses sweet receptorsin your mouth and destroys phospholipidsthat inhibit your bitter receptorsmaking sweet orange juice taste not sosweet and grossly bitter for up to anhour after brushingwhat interests me the most about flavoris the fact that the things that causeit eventually become you you are whatyou eatscientifically your body is alwayslosing dead cells but the elements andmolecules you ingest are processed byyour body into new body here's a fun wayto think about it under the direction ofDNA a cat is made out of air water andcat food that's it cats have less varieddiets than humans we can taste sweetnessbut cats lack the gene required to do sohowever they can taste ATP a moleculethat moves around chemical energy forcells to use in the body which may beassigned to them that they're tasty meatthe point is sights and sounds andtextures and shapes and smells are thenames we give to things that eventuallybecome our memories but flavour is thename we give to the experience of thingsthat eventually become our bodiescontemplating the flavor of human meatis gross but think of it this way youare currently tasting human you aretasting human right now

   "title": "INSIDE a Spherical Mirror",
   "publishedAt": "09 Aug 2013",
   "transcription": "Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.But you areactually right there.Well, at leastthe camera is.Mirrors are amazing.In fact, the word \"mirror\" comes from Latin \"mirari\",meaning \"to wonder at, to admire.\"It's also where we get the word miracle.Mirror--acle. Like when mirrors face each otherand transform a toilet roominto infinity.I love this kind of stuff.But what if instead of a rectangular prism,the room was a sphere, mirroredall the way around?What would it look like?What would you see floating around insuch a room? The first question we shouldask involvesthe light source. If you were in this roomusing a flashlight and you turned theflashlight off,would the light keep bouncing around off ofthe mirrored walls,illuminating the room until your bodyabsorbed all of it?Or if you left the flashlight on,would light continuebouncing around, building up, gettingbrighter and brighter until you lostyour vision and cooked?Probably not.Every time lighthits a mirror and reflects off,a tiny tiny amountis absorbed. Even if your mirrorspherical room was the size of agiant stadium and its walls reflected99.99% of lighton each reflection, light speed is just too fast,meaning that the reflections will happenrapidly, a little bit of light being losteach time.The room will go dark in a fraction ofa fraction of a second. To you and me,it would seem instantaneous.As for what it would look like,let's pretend you begin with your faceup against a wall ofthe sphere and float backwardtoward and past the centre.At first, you would see your face quite clearly.The surrounding reflections would bevery distorted. As you moved away,at a certain point your face would ceaseto shrink away in appear smallerin mirror and instead would grow largerand become magnifieduntil you reach the center at whichpoint your face would fillyour field of view. As you continued on pastthe center, your image would flipupside down and continue receding away.It would look a bit like this.But don't get too enamouredwith your reflection because mirrorsdon't show youas you really are.Have you ever wondered why you liked theway you look in amirror but don't like how you look inphotographs orvideo?It might be because of themere-exposure effect.You prefer what you are used toand most mirrors you look into don't showthe real you, the you that other people in camerassee.Instead, a mirror shows you a reversedversion of yourself and you've becomemore comfortable with that versionof you.A version of you that is flipped left to right.Mirrors reverse along axes perpendicularto their surfaces,like left and right. They don't also flipthings upside down, they don't alsoreverse up and down because those directionsare parallel to the surface of the mirror.When it comes to the way you andother people look,the difference can be startling. NPR pointed out that Abraham Lincolnlooked likethis.Mirrored he would have looked likethis. Now to us, something seemsnoticeably strange about it but it isthe LincolnLincoln would have preferred.It's what he saw every dayin the mirror.But here's something really cool.You can take a flexible mirror andunreverse its image by folding the mirrorinto a cylindrical shape.Take a look at this.Here I am with a reflective material and thereis the camera with some text taped underneath,as you can see everything isflipped left to right.But as I fold the sheet into a cylindrical shapethe image separates, revealing an unreversedversion.It becomes a true mirror.Finally, here is one last pieceof every day mirror trickery.When you look into a mirror,how big is your reflection, your imageon the surface of the mirror to you?Surely,it depends on how far away you are from the mirror.But it doesn't.When you look into a mirror yourreflection on the surface of that mirrorisalways the exact same size.In fact, it is alwaysabout half of your actual size.This is becausewhen light reflects off a mirror,it comes inand reflects back out at the same angle,which means thatin order to reach your eyes at the top of your body,light from your feet at the bottom must hit the mirrorhalfway between the two.The triangles you formwith a mirror are similar, regardless ofwhere you stand.You can demonstrate this effect byoutlining the size of your own head asit appears on the surface of a mirrorusing a bar of soap.Now, because you aren't herelet's pretend that this phone is yourhead and its camerais your eye.We begin up close. The camera looksreally big from this perspective.Let me justcarefully trace around the outside,so we can compare later.Good, good, good. Okay.Now, I'm going to pull away from the mirror. Clearlythe phone is smaller, right?Well,if I reach out and once again carefullytrace the edges.There we go.I will find that I have drawn arectangle that is the exact same size.Your image on the surface of a mirrorfrom your own perspective is always thesame size, whether you are a fewcentimeters away from the mirroror a few kilometres away.Your image on the surface of a mirror in fact isalways half your actual size.Okay, enough about light returning to our eyes.What about lightthat never returns?Could we use a telescope to resolve individualaliens on a planet light years away?Well, over on Vsauce3,Jake investigates this question with Star Wars.And my friend Rusty investigates thepotential for Star Warsbecoming real in his episode of Science Friction.AndVsauce2 has a brand new l\u00fct all about coolStar Wars stuff.Check them all out.And as always,thanks for watching.

   "title": "Are We Ready For Aliens?",
   "publishedAt": "13 Jul 2013",
   "transcription": "Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.But what could beout there?The likelihood of extraterrestrial intelligencehas been the subject of an equation and the current lackof any communication with aliens the subjectof a paradox.But here's a different question. If we were to hearfrom intelligent life beyond earth, what would reallyhappen next?Well, no governmenthas ever officially adopted a post-detection policy.And when asked how they would deal witha confirmed message fromextraterrestrial intelligence,the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairssimply said that their job does notinclude any issues regardingthe question you pose.So are we unprepared? Would chaos ensue?These things are unlikely but the waywe prepare for, and anticipate ourspecies encountering one from beyondearth, is important and illuminating even thoughimprobable.Historically, we haveacted as though alien life exists.Backcontamination is a concern that aman-made object returning from spacecould carry with it undiscovered alienlife forms, especiallyviruses and bacteria that could wipeoutlife on earth.This was a serious concerndealt by serious people when we first senthumans to the Moon.When Neil Armstrong,Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrinreturned from the lunar surface,they didn't immediately hugged theirfamilies and join a public parade.Instead, they were sealed up inbiological isolation garments and flownto a quarantine facility to be lockedaway for three weeks,in Houston, Texas.By Apollo 15 the practice wasdiscontinued but forward contaminationhas alsobeen a real concern. When NASA sent theGalileo spacecraft to serve a Jupiterand its moons, it got amazing databut there was a problem.It had never beensterilized.Because life, even liquid water, could existon these moons, NASA made the decision toavoid contaminating analien biosphere and the mission was over,steered Galileointo Jupiter, where it burned up and was destroyed,along with any Earth life possibly.on board.So protocols and decisions have been officially made inthe pastunder the assumption that aliens might exist.When it comes to actually hearing from aliens,receiving a message fromtechnologically advanced life forms,capable of sending ussay, a radio signal, groups like SETI,the search for extraterrestrialintelligence, are other ones activelylistening.They have an ear to the sky.And theyare prepared. The SETI committee of theInternational Academy of Astronauticscreated a declaration of principlesconcerning activities followingthe detection of extraterrestrial intelligence.No government has officially adoptedany of its recommendations,but if something were to happen,it would likely be the first placeauthorities went.It's one of the only handbooksthey'd have. Seth Shostack explained thephilosophy in atmosphere at SETI,predicting that because verifying a signal is slow,and the media are fast, you will be mediablasted about a possible detectiondays before the people who find it arecertain it's for real.In the midst of rampant media speculation,elation and panic on the part of the public,the most likely string of official events,after the discovery of a message fromextraterrestrial life,would follow SETI recommendations.First of all,the individual or team who discovered the messagewould continue to assess the credibility of the messageand alert all parties to SETI's declaration.Next,once they were certain the message wasreal, the CentralBureau for Astronomical Telegrams would be alerted,so as to inform observers all over the world.They would also inform the secretary-generalof the United Nations, because article 11of the treaty on principles governingthe activities of states in the explorationand use of outer space,including the Moon and other bodiessays they should.The first official newswe got, the public, would likely be in termsof the Rio Scale.First presented to the InternationalAstronautical Congress, the Rio Scale measuresthe significance of consequences ofevidence of extraterrestrial life,making it a likely tool to be used,because it neatly manages publicreaction. There's a great onlinecalculator you can play with to see howthe Rio scaleworks.It takes into account the credibility of the messageon a scale from believed extraterrestrial origin tohoax, how repeatable the observation is,what type of message it is, for instance,is it uninterpretableor clearly for us and how far away it is.Is it extra galactic or near enough thatwe could respond and hear backwithin the length of a human lifetime.Seth Shostak and Ivan Almarapplied the Rio scale to fictional and historicalevents. It's a great way to get a feel forhow the Rio scale will affectvocabularyauthorities use when reporting on an extraterrestrialmessage.They considered the Moon monolith,discovered in 2001: A Space Odyssey, a6 on the Rio scale - noteworthy.In the movie Independence Day,the initial unidentified signal would beabout4 to 8, moderate too far-reaching.Once the message is confirmed to be nofurther than the Moon and moving,it would be an automatic 10, extraordinary.In real life, the Martian Face, discovered in 1976,was a 2 - low. Until high resolutionimages from 2001 revealed it wasnothing, just a thing that looked funnyunder the right conditionsand was immediately downgraded to zero, nosignificance.So if we were to receive a message fromextraterrestrial intelligence,those things in those wordswould likely be used.But who would be in charge?Although she denies ever being selectedor prepared for such a role,Mazlan Othman, the director at theUnited Nations Office for Outer SpaceAffairsis a pretty good candidate.As is PaulDavies, the chairman of SETI's postdetection task force.Were it to be necessary, both of thosepeople are in positions to becomeambassadors for earth-alienrelations.So what do we say back?Well, if we want to show that we areintelligent, perhaps we should send backa string of information representing Pior the Fibonacci sequence.Ormaybe we shouldn't say anything at all.Stephen Hawking warned, quote,\"If aliens visit us, the outcome would be muchas when Columbus landed in America,which didn't turn out wellfor the Native Americans.\"And professor Simon Conway Morris,a Cambridge University palaeontologist has said thatif the cosmic phone rings,we shouldn't pick it up.Observations like thatare at the core of the importance ofthis video's question. We can learn a lotby looking, not just at how we prepare fora space message,but how we imagine actual contact with aliensgoing.Anthropologist Katherine Dennyfrequently points out that the ways weimagine a contact with alienshappening often says more about ourselvesthan it does any hypothetical aliens.We do thisall the time.When we project our ownmodern-day ambitions and fears ontoprehistoric people,Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jeth\u00e1 call that\"flintstoning.\"So let's piggyback off of that phraseand label any projection of modern humanbehaviors, desires, anxietiesonto futuristic, technologically advancedbeings capable of visiting us\"jetsonsing.\"Some examples of jetsonsing involvethinking that any aliens out theretrying to contact usmight want to hurt us. Maybe that'ssimply because whenever we have met newpeople,we often enslave them orpity them or take advantage of them.It's also possible to think that alienswill be friendly.They'll want to help us.The ways we imagine them helping ussay a lot about the kind of help wethink we need.There's a poetic idea that from space Earthlooks peaceful.All of the boundaries we have putup don't exist, you can't see them.But that's notentirely true.The old boundary between East and West Germanyis still visible from space,each side using differentlightbulbs.And this is the boundary between Pakistanand India.You can see from space Indiaflooding the border with lights todeter smugglers from bringing acrossweaponsand ammunition.We don't all get along together hereon earth, we are afraid of each other,we don't trust each otherand the wrinkles and scars that causesare visible from space.Imagining howaliens would interpret that,communicate with us and how we wouldor should respond teaches usa lot about ourselves.It makes our strugglesstrange again.Less ignorable. And that is the entire pointof fantasy. G. K. Chesterton said that thefunction of the imagination is notto make strange things settle,so much as to makesettled things strange.And as always,thanks for watching.",

candownload a program that tells you solartimes on Mars or do what many scientistshave done get yourself a watch that runs2.7 percent slower than usual if everysecond every minute is 2.7 percentslower than it should be it'll beperfect for matching Mars's rotationthat could spell trouble for Martiancolonists though who wish to tune intolive events on earth like sports sortaward shows but again given the immensetravel time between the two Earthlingsand Martians may find that havingsimilar timekeeping systems justreally that necessary in their everydaylives okay right now on earth it is 2016as we know one trip through all theseasons from now will have been a yearbut in that same time Mars will haveonly traveled part of the way throughits seasonsif Martian colonists continue to useearth years that's okay but it wouldmean that for them years would feel abit arbitrary they wouldn't containenvironmental cycles like ours doperhaps if they feel disconnected andemancipated from earth calendars they'lljust use their own Martian year systemas well a few such calendars have beenproposed some divided into familiar weekand month lengths but with about twiceas many of each per year the thinghowever that fascinates me most aboutputting humans living things on Mars isa more touching topic literally humanswill likely touch the red planet in ourlifetimes and the first to do so will befamous but jokes on them I mean we meyou we're all already touching Mars letme ask you this where did you get thatbody that one you're in right now it'smade of atoms and molecules but theycome and go you eat and breathe andabsorb things use them for a while buteventually shed or exhale or otherwisepass them through a month from now yourskin will be completely different skinall new cells the red blood cells you'vegot now we'll only be with you for aboutanother four months like a water waveyou're a temporary arrangement of stuffa really neat thing that dirt does butnot all of this dirt that you are thedust in from dust to dust is earth dirtnew stuff is always falling to earthanywhere from five thousand to threehundred thousand kilograms of space rockdust debris asteroid fragments thata some of which inevitably winds upbeing you part of your body for a whilenow that may sound like a lot ofmaterial but compared to the mass ofearth it's small some of these et rocksare debris that's been floating aroundour solar system since the planetsformed some has come from asteroidcollisions some has even come frominterstellar space beyond our solarsystem what's neat is that because atomsand molecules are so small even the tinyamount of interstellar material landinghere adds up to a lot at the atomicscale ask a physicist estimated that ifonly 0.01% of all the extra-terrestrialmaterial falling to earth comes frombeyond our solar system and even if only10% of that stuff is water that wouldstill mean that 50 billion 5 0 billionwith a beam of the water molecules inyour body right now as you watch thisvideo we're in interstellar space fewerthan 1,000 years agosome of the space material falling toearth comes from planets like Mars whenpowerful enough impacts occur on itssurfaceMartian material can reach escapevelocity and begin an interplanetaryjourney rarely but occasionally thisjourney terminates on earth it's beenestimated that Martian meteorites onlyfall to earth about once every 50 yearsor so that's a long time in human yearsbut in Planet years that's nothing yourphysical body right nowlikely contains billions of atoms thatused to be on Mars and arrived here onearth in the last 1,000 years if youconsider stuff from Mars that's beenhere on earth for less than a millenniumas being Martian well it's tenable tosay that you are point zero zero zerozero zero zero zero zero zero zero zerozero zero zero zero one percent Martianbut before you get too excited there's adifference between Martian debris thatwas roasted and exploded in ouratmosphere centuries ago and actualstill on Mars materialthe difference might be small or itmight be big when Apollo 11 astronautsreturned from the moon they didn'tsplashdown and then run into the arms offamily members instead they were lockedaway in quarantine for three weeksjust in case the moon harbored any kindof previously unknown or unthinkablelife-form an organism or virus thatcould have come back to earth with themone that earth life had neverencountered and thus never beennaturally selected to resist the threatof a moonbug pandemic wiping out life onEarth was just large enough that NASAtook precautions though later BuzzAldrin admitted on Twitter that theirquarantine facility wasn't perfectlysealed luckily no moon germs escaped andinfected all earth life probably becausethere weren't any to begin with afterApollo 14 the moon quarantinerequirement was lifted because it hadbecomesufficiently clear that the moon wasdevoid of life but Mars well we stilldon't know exactlywe haven't found macroscopic life onMars but the possibility of tiny thingshasn't yet been ruled out and theincredible consequences contaminationcould have means it remains a seriousconcern there's even an advocacy groupof scientists from all over the worldcalled the International CommitteeAgainst Mars sample return but it's notjust bat contamination that matters thetransfer of extraterrestrial organismsto earththere's also forward contamination thetransfer of earth organisms to things inspace any light that might currentlyexist on Mars could be incrediblyvulnerable to things we here on earthbarely notice but accidentally bringthere how sad would it be to one dayfind life on Marsonly to realize that it's all deadeverything it had to teach us aboutitself about Mars about the solar systemabout

earth may have even arrivedfrom space in that way a concept calledpanspermia so should we be scared ofmonsters beyond our atmosphere I'mreminded of the glowworm in their larvalstage the glowworms

it's away out of the cave of course it's notthe glow worms dangle sticky mucusstrings from their perches snares thatcapturetheir prey are the real stars nodifferent a clever trap that keeps alienpredators fed probably not but thathasn't stopped space agencies like NASAfrom forming divisions like their officefor planetary protection a group thatoversees plans for missions that mightbring earth and alien life into contactcurrently all missions to Mars mustsatisfy the Coleman Sagan equation thissterilization restriction works toensure that the probability of uscontaminating places like Mars withforeign earthly organisms is not zerobut at most one in 10,000 that wasconsidered acceptable given the numberof Mars missions we probably do beforefully understanding its exobiology sofar we have no evidence that anything isalive on Mars right now or has ever beenbut that brings us to Anne's met theAntarctic search for meteorites aneffort that since 1976 has found morethan 20,000 extraterrestrial rocks inAntarctica the first one they found inAllen Hills in 1984 was special for onething it's believed to have originatedon Mars it's estimated that about 17million years ago this piece of rock wasblasted off the surface of Mars by ameteor and reached terminal velocityabout 5 kilometers per second fastenough to leave Mars entirely afterflying through space for a very longtime 13,000 years ago it got captured byEarth's gravity and fell to our planet'ssurface 12 years after its discovery thepresence of what looked like microscopicfossils were discovered on the rockcould they be evidence of Martian lifethe claim didn't convince everyone butto this day the structures exact originshaven't been explained how exactly totell whether they're caused by livingthings isn't agreed on either but thefinding was a major event in the fieldof astrobiology and the public'sunderstanding of itthe discovery was possibly so momentousthat US President Bill Clinton gaveremarks about it saying today Rock 84001speaks to us across all those billionsof years and millions of miles it speaksof the possibility of life if thisdiscovery is confirmed it will surely beone of the most stunning insights intoour universe that science has everuncovered after his statement these arethe two questions he was asked by thepress did he believe abortion rightswere under attack and where did he gethis tie the thing is alien nano bacteriadon't wear ties they don't legislate orgovern us or control our lives or lookanything like us if they exist will mostlikely be in control of them andprobably actually not even notice themunder our bootsso does protecting or preserving themnot matter I mean should should we justnot let them get in the way of ourprogress as a species well that's afundamental question that touches uponwhat we want our purpose to be in thisuniverse labeling parts of Marsdon't touch as parks would be a greatway to preserve it as it was before wecame so that our grandchildren and theirchildren can see what Mars was like forwell most of human history others haveargued that we shouldn't go at all thatMars is best left to itselfhumans ruin things and what right do wehave to alter Mars if we can helpourselves still others say why stop atnatural parks if we find viable life onMars that may be struggling to survive arare relic perhaps from a time when Marswas more hospitable to life they arguethat we should help change Mars so thatthose remaining Martian organisms canthrive and multiply and be their bestselves with our technology intelligenceand sapiens we perhaps alone in thesolar system have the power to help themand we should help ourselves to Marssecond these aren't just hypotheticalphilosophical problems by the way withplans for manned missions to Mars just abit under two decades away theirquestions we will actually need toanswer quite soon should humans go toMars it would be a great way to spreadout to diversify our habitats so we'restill around should anything happen toearth and of course it does give us morespace for more people but for whatultimately Jupiter doesn't care if thereare seven billion humans or seventrillion the volcanoes of Iowill continue erupting whether or not wewrite anymore poems about love if humanswere wiped out today the fundamentalforces of the universe wouldn't changeand distant galaxies would continuetheir journeys into the abyss beyond theobservable universe just as they alreadyare and always will what good is life tothe universe perhaps it has nonebut we are possibly its greatest andonly hope to find out we may not treatlife as well as we could but whateverthis darn life thing is keeping itaround might very well be up to us weowe it at least that much and as alwaysthanks for

created and you couldn't justGoogle up every single band overlap waseasier to get away with and one wordband names were plentiful but now afteryears and years and years of bandformation well we have the who but wealso have the what the where the win thewhy the how and even the does in orderto stand out to now and have your ownunique name you have to be a bit morecreative Ohdiarrhea planet or Betty's not a vitaminwhich by the way is no longer true Bettybecame a vitamin in 1994 what aboutTwitter handles or email addresses havewe already reached peak username wealready find ourselves often having touse abbreviations initials numbers orjust choosing something completelydifferentwill our children or our children'schildren live in a world where the onlyremaining Gmail addresses are justrandom strings of alphanumericcharacters are we approaching a namecrisis and if so should we even call ita name crisis lest we use up yet anotherprecious name maybe you already shareyour name with someone famous but if youdon't how long will it be until youprobably will I mean new famous peopleare popping up all the time faster nowthan ever before because of the internetand they are gobbling up top Googlesearch billing maybe it won't happenuntil long after you've been dead butshouldn't the reservoir of names nottaken by notable people eventually runout computer scientist Samuel R bhismanaproxenhow many famous people there are alivetoday and I think his calculation willbe helpful you see he points out that ifwe allow famous to simply mean beingnotable enough to have your ownWikipedia page well because there are700,000 living people with Wikipediapages right now that means one out ofevery 10,000 people on earth today arefamous assuming at the least that thatproportion remains constantsince 255 people are born every minutethat means every hour a future famousperson is born their name destined tobecome primarily associated with themnot everyone else who shares their nameall of those people will be relegated todisambiguation or the post no meal notthe famous one luckily if you do themath you'll find that even at a rate ofone future famous person born every hourit would still take dozens of millenniafor most of us to expect a future famousperson with our exact name to emergeplus names change new ones becomepopular others obsolesce but for funlet's not focus on names we popularlyuse and instead look at how manypossible names there can be the SocialSecurity Administration allows up to 36letters for a complete name nowincluding spaces 27 letters filling 36spots with repetition allowed means 3sec's de Cillian possible combinationsthat's more than Earth has atoms solet's refine our limitshow many pronounceable names arepossible for that I say we look at whatRandall Munroethe author of the fantastic what if didwhen asked about naming stars if youwant to give every single star in theobservable universe a unique butpronounceable English name how longwould the names have to be hisapproximation is really fascinating ifwe define a pronounceable word as a wordthat contains consonant vowel pairs wecan roughly figure that there are abouta hundred and five different such pairpossibilities 105 that's not too muchdifferent from 99 so funny enough thereare about the same number of consonantvowel pairs possible as there are twodigit numbers which means we could giveevery star in the observable universe asaleableunique name with just 24 letters thesame number of digits it would take tojust number all of them so the bottomline is we may each have to give upuniquely owning a word or name that'scommon today but the potential number ofnames that can be made is really Hardyin fact before we run out of those ourspecies will likely evolve tocommunicate in a completely differentway also names aren't just labels a nameon a screen a username a handle a screenname doesn't always act exactly like itsowner user names can travel more quicklyand more widely than flesh-and-bloodpeople and do things that theirpuppeteers wouldn't normally do awayfrom the keyboardit's called the online disinhibitioneffect if you can't see the peopleyou're interacting with and they can'tsee you you're all just online hidingbehind different names than usual whyhold backI mean clearly such a system can't beserious business on the internet no oneknows you're a dog why be nice or tellthe truth the subreddit karma Courtinvestigates and uncovers people who maythink that the less face-to-face natureof the Internet makes lies easier to getaway with like this person who posted animage suggesting that they've beensingle for a year but had users foundout posted three months earlier apicture of my girlfriend's cat thesebehaviors aren't just what humans dowhen they can be anonymous or can hidebehind different names these behaviorscan also be caused by the namesthemselves studies have found that theusername you use can impact how youbehave your own pre-existing stereotypesand expectations of certain words shapescolors can be confirmed by your behaviorin the same way that studies have foundNFL and NHL players play moreaggressively when

whenit infects a human and what should weall do a virus is really just a hullaround genetic material and a fewproteins arguably not even a livingthing it can only make more of itself byentering a living cell Korona may spreadvia surfaces but it's still uncertainhow long it can survive on them its mainway of spreading seems to be dropped itinfection when people cough or if youtouch someone who's ill and then yourface say rubbing your eyes or nose thevirus starts its journey here and thenhitches a ride as a still way deeperinto the body its destinations are theintestines the spleen or the lungs whereit can have the most dramatic effecteven just a few corona viruses can causequite a dramatic situation the lungs arelined with billions of epithelial cellsthese are the border cells of

viruses swarmed the lungsthe virus has not caused too much damageyet butis now going to release a real beast onyou your own immune system the immunesystem while there to protect you canactually be pretty dangerous to yourselfand needs tight regulation and as immunecells pour into the lungs to fight thevirus Corona infects some of them andcreates confusion cells have neitherears nor eyes they communicate mostlyvia tiny information proteins calledcytokines nearly every important immunereaction is controlled by them Coronacauses infected immune cells tooverreact and yell bloody murder in asense it puts the immune system into afighting frenzy and sends way moresoldiers than it should wasting itsresources and causing damage to kinds ofcells in particular wreak havoc firstnutria files which are great at killingstuff including ourselves as they arrivein their thousands they start pumpingout enzymes that destroy as many friendsas enemies the other important type ofcells that go into

system slowlyregains control it kills the infectedcells intercepts the viruses trying toinfect new ones and cleans up thebattlefield recovery begins the majorityof people infected by Corona will getthrough it with relatively mild symptomsbut many cases become severe or evencritical we don't know the percentagebecause not all cases have beenidentified but it's safe to say thatthere is a lot more than with the flu inmore severe cases millions of epithelialcells have died and with them the lungsprotective lining is gone that meansthat the alveoli tiny air sacs via whichbreathing occurs can be infected bybacteria that aren't usually a bigproblempatience get pneumonia respirationbecomes hard or even fails and patientsneed ventilators to survive the immunesystem has fought at full capacity forweeks and made millions of antiviralweapons and as thousands of bacteriarapidly multiply it is overwhelmed theyenter the blood and overrun the body ifthis happens death is very likely thecorona virus is often compared to theflu but actually it's much moredangerous while the exact death rate ishard to pin down during an ongoingpandemic we know for sure that it's muchmore contagious and spreads faster thanthe flu there are two futures for apandemic like corona fast and slow whichfuture we will see depends on how we allreact to it in the early days of theoutbreak a first pandemic will behorrible and cost many lives a slowpandemic will not be remembered by thehistory books the worst case scenariofor a fast pandemic begins with a veryrapid rate of infection because thereare no counter measures in place to slowit down why is this so bad in a fastpandemic many people get sick at thesame time if the numbers get too largehealth care systems become unable tohandle it there aren't enough resourceslike medical staff or equipment likeventilators left to help everybodypeople will die untreated and as morehealth care workers get sick themselvesthe capacity of health care systemsFalls even further if this becomes thecase then horrible decisions will haveto be made about who gets to live andwho doesn't the number of deaths Risessignificantly in such a scenario toavoid this the world that means all ofus needs to do what it can to turn thisinto a slow pandemic a pandemic isslowed down by the right responsesespecially in the early phase so thateveryone who gets sick can get treatmentand there's no crunch point withoverwhelmed hospitals since we don'thave a vaccine for Corona we have tosocially engineer ourAvia to act like a social vaccine thissimply means two things not gettinginfected and not infecting othersalthough it sounds trivial the very bestthing you can do is to wash your handsthe soap is actually a powerful toolthe corona virus is encased in what isbasically a layer of fat soap breaksthat fat apart and leaves it unable toinfect you it also makes your handsslippery and with the mechanical motionsof washing viruses are ripped away to doit properly wash your hands as if you'vejust cut up some jalapenos and what toput in your contacts next the next thingis social distancing which is not a niceexperience but a nice thing to do thismeans no hugging no handshakes if youcan stay at home stay at home to protectthose who need to be out for society tofunction from doctors to cashiers orpolice officers you depend on all ofthem they all depend on you to not getsick on a larger level there arequarantine which can mean differentthings from travel restrictions oractual orders to stay at homequarantines are not great to experienceand certainly not popular but they by usand especially the researchers workingon medication and vaccinations crucialtime so if you are put under quarantineyou should understand why and respect itnone of this is fun but looking at thebig picture it is a really small priceto pay the question of how pandemics enddepends on how they startif they start fast with a steep slopethey end badlyif they start slow with a not so steepslope they endo'cash and in this day and age it reallyis in all of our hands literally andfiguratively a huge thanks to theexperts who helped us on short noticewith this video

everknow about them basically everythingoutside of our direct galacticneighborhood the so called local groupis pretty much out of our reach foreverbecause of the expansion of the universeeven if we had really fast spaceships itwould literally take billions of yearsto reach these places traveling throughthe emptiest areas in the universe solet's focus on the Milky Way the MilkyWay is our home galaxy it consists of upto 400 billion stars that's a lot ofstars roughly 10,000 for every grain ofsand on earth there are about 20 billionsun-like stars in the Milky Way andestimates suggest that 1/5 of them havean earth-sized planet in its habitablezone the area with conditions thatenable life to exist if only 0.1% ofthose planets Harvard life there wouldbe 1 million planets with life in theMilky Way but wait there's more theMilky Way is about 13 billion years oldin the beginning it would not have beena good place for life because thingsexploded a lot but after one to twobillion years the first habitableplanets were born earth is only 4billion years old so there have probablybeen trillions of chances for life todevelop on other planets in the past ifonly a single one of them had

energy available on its planet incase you're wondering we're currentlyaround 0.73 on the scale and we shouldreach type 1 sometime in the next coupleof hundred years type 2 would be acivilization capable of harnessing allof the energy of its home star thiswould require some serious sciencefiction but it is doable in principleconcepts like the Dyson Sphere a giantcomplex surrounding the Sun would beconceivable type 3 is a civilizationthat basically controls its whole galaxyand its energy an alien race that thisadvanced would probably be godlike to usbut why should we be able to see such analien civilization in the first place ifwe were to build generation spaceshipsthat could sustain a population foraround 1,000 years we could colonize thewhole galaxy in 2 million years soundslike a long time but remember the MilkyWay is huge so if it takes a couple ofmillion years to colonize the entiregalaxy and there are possibly millionsif not billions of planets that sustainlife in the Milky Way and these otherlife-forms have had considerably moretime than we've had then where are allthe aliens this is the Fermi paradox andnobody has an answer to it but we dohave some ideas let's talk about filtersa filter in this context represents abarrier that is really hard for life toovercome they come in various degrees ofscary one there are great filters and wehave passedmaybe it is way harder for complex lifeto develop than we thinkthe process allowing life to beginhasn't yet been completely figured outand the conditions required may bereally complicated maybe in the past theuniverse was way more hostile and onlyrecently have things cooled down to makecomplex life possible this would alsomean that we may be unique or at leastone of the first if not the

   "publishedAt": "24 Aug 2017",
   "transcription": "black holes are the most powerful thingsin the universe strong enough to ripwhole stars into atoms sized pieces wellthis is scary enough they have an evenmore powerful and dark property theymight delete the universe itself blackholes in a nutshell a black hole appearswhen an extraordinary amount of matteris concentrated in a tiny space at theircenter gravity is almost infinitelystrong and whatever gets too close isripped into its elementary particles noteven light can escape black holes and sowe perceive them as spheres of blacknessif you were to fall into a black holenothing bad would happen until wellafter you crossed its outer border theevent horizon you can imagine this asswimming in a river that ends in anenormous waterfall as you float alongimperceptibly the stream gets faster andfaster even if you can't see thewaterfall yet you could swim to safetyuntil without even noticing it you crossthe point of no return no matter howfast you try to swim now the stream willpull you towards certain death nothingcan escape a black hole waterfall onceit gets too closethis border completely separates blackholes from the rest of the universe wecan't access them unless we're willingto never return so there's no way oftelling what's really going on insideblack holes but we have a few ideasabout what's going on right at theirvery edgesblack holes radiate their mass away likea hot pot on a stove losing its wateresteem this is called Hawking radiationblack holes constantly lose an extremelytiny amount of their mass a processthat's unbelievably slow it will take ablack hole with a mass of our Sun 10,000billion billion billion billion billionbillion years to lose zero point zerozero zero zero zero zero one percent ofits mass this is happening constantlyand unstoppablyand as it goes on it speeds up more andmore in the far far future when the laststar in the universe has been dead fortrillions of years black holes willbecome tinier and tinier until theyevaporate and disappear leaving behindjust a bit of radiation but this is aproblem because in the process ofdisappearing black holes might deletesomething fundamental information - whatis information information is nothingtangible it's typically understood as aproperty of the arrangement of particleswhat does this mean imagine a bunch ofcarbon atoms arrange them in a certainway and you get coal arrange them in adifferent way and you get a diamond theanswers are the same what changes is theinformation if we make this more complexand add in a few more atoms we get abanana change the arrangement of theatoms and we get a squirrel the basicbuilding blocks of everything in theuniverse are the same and don't care ifthey're part of a bird or a rock or acup of coffee without informationeverything in the universe would be thesame according to the theory of quantummechanics information is indestructibleit might change shape but it can neverbe lost for example if you burn a pieceof paper you get ash that ash will neverbecome paper again but if you were ableto carefully collect every single carbonatom in the ash and measured the exactproperties of the smoke and heatradiating from the fire you could intheory reconstruct the paperthe information of the paper is still inthe universe it's not lost it's justhard to read if you could somehowmeasure every single atom and particleand wave of radiation in the universeyou could see and track every bit ofinformation there is hypothetically youcould see the entire history of theuniverse right back to the Big Bang andhereblack holes trip us up information tellsus how things are different from eachotherand what used to be what black holes dothe opposite they take different thingsand make them the same they destroyinformation this creates the informationparadox and this is a serious problemthe information paradox it's fundamentalfor all our laws of physics thatinformation can never be lostexisting not existing withoutinformation everything is relative whenit comes to our understanding of realitywe need absolute how could we solve thisparadox there are a few possibilitiesone information is lost irretrievablyand forever this means we have to nixall our laws of physics throwing out alot of stuff that's worked very well sofar and to start from scratch what thosenew laws of physics would look like orwhat that means for us nobody knows thisis a little frightening but also kind ofexciting too information is hidden maybea little part of the black hole splitsoften forms a baby universe theinformation would be transferred intothis new weird place where we couldnever observe or interact with it buttechnically it would not be lost it'slike having a broken hard drive with allyour family photos that you could neveraccess sure it's nice that they've notbeen deleted but also not very helpfulor maybe black holes don't disappearcompletely after the end of their lifecycles but a little piece is left aninformation diamond like a clown carfilled with an infinite amount ofinformation clowns but there's a thirdoption information is safe after all notlost or hiddenperhaps we've just been looking at thiswhole thing the wrong way we know thatblack holes trap information and mightdelete it later but we never thoughtabout what they do with it in themeantimewe're two black holes store theirinformation cosmic housekeeping let'screate a black hole with dirty laundryfirst we fill up a room with laundrybaskets the more laundry you want tostore the more baskets you put in theroom but at some point every singlebasket is full and the room iscompletely stacked not a single extrasock fits in the room is at maximumcapacity but if we still squeeze thesock in with a lot of energy andviolence the room collapses in on itselfand forms a black hole but the capacityof the room itself has not changedfitting in more stuff for information isstill impossible so what happens if wethrow more laundry into it the roomitself gets a little bit bigger to makespace for the new information it turnsout a black hole grows its surface by atiny pixel for each bit of informationwe throw into it in a nutshell moreinformation means more surface area theinformation gets painted on the surfacesimilar to what happens when we throw astone into a pond after the stone sinksto the bottom we can't see it anymorebut we can tell that something went infrom the ripples on the surface of thepond even the smallest black hole canstore more information on its surfacethan all the data ever produced in humanhistory they do this by storinginformation in a type of pixel that isunbelievably tiny black holes are theultimate hard drive this is a bit liketaking a paper bag and turning it intoan e-book to things that look completelydifferent but their content is the sameit's just encoded and memorized inanother wayblack holes swallowing stars and planetsis a bit like transferring a wholelibrary onto an e-readerthis solution is called the holographicprinciple but if it's correct theneverything we thought we knew about theuniverse is wrong the universe is ahologram if information is actuallystored on the boundary of a black holethe Hawking radiation has a chance oflearning about the information encodedthere and can carry it away soinformation is not lost when black holesfade awayand we do not need to redo physics theinformation paradox is resolved but westill have to change our understandingof reality in a fundamental way ifeverything that falls into the blackhole is stored on its event horizon thatbasically means that three-dimensionalstuff is encoded on a flat surfacewe have a name for this a hologram ahologram is like a 3d photo a flat pieceof plastic that encodes athree-dimensional image a black hole islike a hologrambecause everything inside it is encodedon its event horizon a person inside ablack hole would experience their usualthree-dimensional life but for us on theoutside they are flattened images on thesurface of the black hole theconsequence of this is counterintuitivebut stay with us for a momentblack holes are very extreme objects butthey're still bound to the same rules aseverything else so if this crazy quality between 2d and 3d works for blackholes then it might work for the wholeuniverse and you in it since a personinside a black hole would not realizethat they're encoded on a flat surfacewe might share the same fate you reallymight be stretched over a flat screen atthe end of the universethe science behind this is complicatedand really weird with toy universes toplay with string theory and a lot ofmass we'll talk about this more inanother video regardless of what thetrue nature of the universe really is wejust know that it's strange andcomplicated and we have to do a lot morephysics to understand it but black holesmight be key to understanding the natureof reality itselfthis video was supported by the SwissNational Science Foundation and

   "title": "The Immune System Explained I \u2013 Bacteria Infection",
   "publishedAt": "01 Jul 2014",
   "transcription": "Every second of your life, you are under attack.Billions of bacteria, viruses, and fungi are trying to make you their home.So our bodies have developed a super complex little army with guards, soldiers, intelligence, weapons factories, and communicatorsto protect you from...well...dyingFor this video, let's assume the immune system has 12 different jobs. For example, kill enemies, communicate, etc.And it has 21 different cells and 2 protein forcesThese cells have up to 4 different jobs.Let's assign them. Here are the interactions.Now, let's make this understandable.First of all, let's add colours to the jobs.Now let's illustrate the cells.The central colour represents the main job of the cell.While the surrounding ones represent secondary duties.Now the immune system looks like this.Now the interactions.Isn't this complexity just awesome?For this video we will only talk about these cells and ignore the rest.So, what happens in the case of an infection?It's a beautiful day, when suddenly, a wild rusty nail appears and you cut yourself.The first barrier of the immune system is breached: your skin.Nearby bacteria seize on the opportunity and enter your wound.They start using up the body's resources and double their numbers about every 20 minutes.At first, they fly under the radar, but when a certain bacteria population is reachedThey change their behaviour and start to damage the body by changing the environment around them.The immune system has to stop them as fast as possible.First of all, your guard cells, known as macrophages, intervene.They are huge cells that guard every border region of the body.Most of the time, they alone can suffocate an attackbecause they can devour up to 100 intruders each.They swallow the intruder whole and trap it inside a membrane.Then the enemy gets broken down by enzymes and is killed.On top of that, they cause inflammation by ordering the blood vessels to release water into the battlefieldso fighting becomes easier.You notice this as a very mild swelling.When the macrophages fight for too long,they call in heavy backup by releasing messenger proteins that communicate location and urgency.Neutrophils leave their patrol routes in the blood and move to the battlefield.The neutrophils fight so furiously that they kill healthy cells in the process.On top of that, they generate barriers that trap and kill the bacteria.They are, indeed, so deadly that they evolved to commit suicide after five days to prevent them from causing too much damage.If this is not enough to stop the invasion, the brain of the immune system kicks in.The dendritic cell gets active, it reacts to the signals of the soldiers and starts collecting samples from the enemies.They rip them into pieces and present the parts on their outer layer.Now the dendritic cell makes a crucial decision.Should they call for anti-virus forces that eradicate infected body cells...or an army of bacteria killers?In this case, anti-bacteria forces are necessary.It then travels to the closest lymph node in about a day.Here, billion of helper and killer T cells are waiting to be activated.When T cells are born they go trough a difficult and complicated training processand only a quarter survives.The surviving cells are equipped with a specific set-up.And the denditric cell is on its way looking for a helper T cell with the set-up that's just right.It's looking for a helper T cell that can bind the parts of the intruders which the dendritic cell has presented on its membrane.When it finally finds one, a chain reaction takes place.The helper T cell is activated, it quickly duplicates thousands of times.Some become memory T cells that stay in the lymph node and will make you practically immune against this enemy,Some travel to the field of battle to help out.And the third group goes on to travel to the centre of the lymph nodeto activate a very powerful weapons factory.Like the T cells, they are born with a specific set-upand when a B cell and a T cell with the same set-up meet, hell breaks loose.The B cell duplicates rapidly and starts producing millions of little weapons.They work so hard that they will literally die from exhaustion very fast.Here helper T cells play another important role, they stimulate the hard working factories and tell them:\"Don't die yet, we still need you, keep going!\"This also ensures that the factories die if the infection is over so the body doesn't waste energy or hurt itself.But what is produced by the B cells?You've heard of them of course, antibodies,Little proteins that are engineered to bind to the surface of the specific intruder.There are even different kinds of antibodies that have slightly different jobs.The helper T cells tell the plasma cells which type is needed the most in this particular invasion.Millions of them flood the blood and saturate the body.Meanwhile, at the site of infection, the situation is getting dire.The intruders have multiplied in number and start hurting the body.Guard and attack cells fight hard, but also die in the process.Helper T cells support them by ordering them to be more aggressive and to stay alive longer.But without help they can't overwhelm the bacteria.But now, the second line of defence arrives.Billions of antibodies flood the battlefield and disable lots of the intruders,rendering them helpless or killing them in the process.They also stun the bacteria and make them an easy target.Their back is built to connect to killer cells, so they can connect and kill the enemy more easily,Macrophages are especially good at nomming up the bacteria which antibodies have attached to.Now the balance shifts, in a team effort, the infection is wiped out.At this point, millions of body cells have already died, no big deal, the losses are quickly replenished.Most immune cells are now useless and without the constant signals they commit suicide, so as not to waste any resources.But some stay behind: the memory cells.If this enemy is encountered ever again in the future, they will be ready for it and probably kill it before you even notice.This was a very, very simplified explanation of parts of the immune system at work.Can you imagine how complex this system is, even at this level, when we ignore so many players and all the chemistry.Life is awfully complicated, but if we take the time to understand it, we'll encounter endless wonders and great beauty.",

   "title": "Genetic Engineering Will Change Everything Forever \u2013 CRISPR",
   "publishedAt": "10 Aug 2016",
   "transcription": "Imagine you were alive back in the1980's and were toldthe computers would soontake over everything.>From shopping to datingand the stock market.That billions of peoplewould be connected via a kind of web.That you would own a handheld deviceorders of magnitude more powerfulthan supercomputers.It would seem absurd butthen all of it happened.Science fiction became our realitythat we don't even think about itWe're at a similar point today withgenetic engineering.So let's talk about it.Where it came from?What we're doing right now?And about a recent breakthroughthat will change how we liveand what we perceive as \"normal\" forever.Humans have been engineering life forthousands of years. Through selective breedingwe strengthened useful traitsand plants and animals.We became very good at this butnever truly understood how it works.Until we discovered the code of life:deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA,a complex molecule the guide ofthe growth, development functionand reproduction of everything alive.Information is encoded inthe structure of the molecule.Four nucleotides are pairedand make up a code that carries instructions.Change the instructions and you changethe being carrying it.As soon as DNA wasdiscovered people try to tinker with it.In the 1960's, scientists bombardedplants with radiationto cause random mutationsin the genetic code.The idea was to geta useful plant variation by pure chance.Sometimes, it actually worked too.In the 70's, scientists inserted DNA snippetsinto bacteria, plants and animalsto study and modify them for research,medicine, agriculture and for fun.The earliest genetically modified animalwas born in 1974,making mice a standard tool for research,saving millions of lives.In the 80's, we got commercial.first patent was given for a microbeengineered to absorb oil today weproduce many chemicals by means ofengineered life like life-savingclotting factors growth hormones andinsulin, all things we had to harvestfrom the organs of animals before that.The first food modified in the lab wenton sale in 1994: the Flavr Savr tomato,a tomato given a much longer shelf lifewhere an extra gene that suppresses thebuild-up of a rotting enzyme. But GM foodand the controversy surrounding themdeserve a video of their own.In the 1990's there was also a briefforay into human engineering. To treatmaternal infertility, babies were madeto carry genetic information fromthree humans making them the firsthumans ever to have three geneticparents. Today there are super muscledpigs, fast-growing salmon, featherlesschickens and see-through frogs. On thefun side, we made things glow in the darkfluorescent zebrafish are available foras little as ten dollars.All of this is already very impressivebut until recently,gene editing was extremely expensive,complicated and took a long time to do.This has now changed with arevolutionary new technology nowentering the stage: CRISPR. Overnight, thecosts of engineering have shrunk by 99%Instead of a year.it takes a few weeks to conductexperiments and basically everybody witha lab can do it. It's hard to get acrosshow big a technical revolution CRISPR is.It literally has the potential tochange humanity forever.Why did this sudden revolution happenand how does it work?Bacteria and viruses have been fightingsince the dawn of life.So-called bacteriophages, or phages, hunt bacteria.In the ocean, phages kill 40% of themevery single day.Phages do this by inserting their own genetic code intothe bacteria and taking them over to usethem as factories.The bacteria try to resist, but fail most of the timebecause their protection tools are too weak.But sometimes, bacteria survive an attack.Only if they do so can they activatetheir most effective antivirus system.They save a part of the virus DNA intheir own genetic code in a DNA archivecalled CRISPR.Here it's stored safelyuntil it's needed.When the virus attacks again,the bacterium quickly makes an RNA copyfrom the DNA archive and arms asecret weapon, a protein called Cas9.The protein now scans the bacterium'sinside for signs of the virus invader bycomparing every bit of DNA it finds tothe sample from the archive.When it finds a 100-percent perfect matchit's activated and cuts out the virus DNAmaking it useless, protecting thebacterium against the attack.What's special is that Cas9 is veryprecise, almost like a DNA surgeon.The revolution began when scientists figuredout that the CRISPR system is programmable.You can just give it a copyof DNA you want to modify and put thesystem into a living cell. If the oldtechniques of genetic manipulation werelike a map, CRISPR is like a GPS system.Aside from being precise cheap and easy,CRISPR offers the ability toedit life cells to switch genes on andoff and target and study particular DNAsequences.It also works for every typeof cell: microorganisms, plantsanimals or humans. But despite therevolution CRISPR is for science,it's still just a first generation tool.More precise tools are already beingcreated and used as we speak.In 2015, scientists use CRISPR to cut the HIVvirus out of living cells from patientsin the lab, proving that it was possible.Only about a year later they carried outa larger scale project with rats thathad the HIV virus in basically all oftheir body cells. By simply injectingCRISPR into the rats tails, they wereable to remove more than 50%of the virus from cells all over the body.In a few decades, a CRISPR therapymight cure HIV and other retroviruses.Viruses that hide inside human DNA likeherpes could be eradicated this way.CRISPR could also defeat one of ourworst enemies: cancer. Cancer occurs whencells refused to die and keepmultiplying while concealing themselvesfrom the immune system. CRISPR gives usthe means to edit your immune cells andmake them better cancer hunters. Gettingrid of cancer might eventually meangetting just a couple of injections of afew thousand of your own cells that havebeen engineered in the lab to heal youfor good.The first clinical trial for a CRISPRcancer treatment on human patients wasapproved in early 2016 in theUS. Not even a month later, Chinesescientists announced that they wouldtreat lung cancer patients with immunecells modified by CRISPR in August 2016.Things are picking up pace quickly.And then there are genetic diseases. Thereare thousands of them and they range,from merely annoying to deadly or entaildecades of suffering. With a powerfultool like CRISPR, we may be able to endthis. Over 3,000 genetic diseases arecaused by a single incorrect letter inyour DNA.We are already building a modifiedversion of Cas9 that is made tochange just a single letter, fixing thedisease in the cell. In a decade or twowe could possibly cure thousands ofdiseases forever. But all of thesemedical applications have one thing incommon: they are limited to theindividual and die with them, except ifyou use them on reproductive cells orvery early embryos. But CRISPR can andprobably will be used for much more:the creation of modified humans, designerbabies and will mean gradual butirreversible changes to the human genepool.The means to edit the genome of ahuman embryo already exists, though thetechnology is still in its early stages.But it has already been attempted twice:in 2015 and 2016, Chinese scientistsexperimented with human embryos and werepartially successful on their secondattempt. They showed the enormouschallenges we still face in gene editingembryos but also that scientists areworking on solving them.This is like the computer in theseventies: there will be better computers.Regardless of your personal take ongenetic engineering, it will affect you.Modified humans could alter the genomeof our entire species because theirengineered traits will be passed on tothat children and could spread overgenerations slowly modifying the wholegene pool of humanity. It will startslowly: the first designer babies willnot be overly designed, it's most likelythat they will be created to eliminatedeadly genetic disease running a family.As the technology progresses and getsmore refined, more and more people may arguethat not using genetic modification isunethical, because it condemns childrento preventable suffering and death anddenies them to cure. But as soon as thefirst engineered kid is born, a door isopened that can't be closed anymore.Early on, vanity traits will mostly beleft alone, but as genetic modificationbecomes more accepted and our knowledgeof our genetic code enhances,the temptation will grow.If you make your offspringimmune to Alzheimer, why not alsogive them an enhanced metabolism?Why not throw in perfect eyesight? Howabout height or muscular structure?Full hair? How about giving your child the gift ofextraordinary intelligence? Huge changesare made as a result of the personaldecisions of millions of individualsthat accumulate. This is a slippery slope.Modified humans could become the newstandard, but as engineering becomes morenormal and our knowledge improves, wecould solve the single biggest mortalityrisk factor: aging. Two-thirds of the150,000 people who die today will dieof age-related causes. Currently we thinkaging is caused by the accumulation ofdamage to ourselves, like DNA breaks andthe system's responsible for fixingthose wearing off over time. But thereare also genes that directly affectaging. A combination of geneticengineering and other therapy could stopor slow down aging, maybe even reverse it.We know from nature that there areanimals immune to aging. Maybe we couldeven borrow a few genes for ourselves.Some scientists even think biologicalaging could be something that eventuallyjust stops being a thing. We would stilldie at some point, but instead of doingso in hospitals at age 90we might be able to spend a few thousandyears with our loved ones. Research intothis is in its infancy, and manyscientists are rightly skeptical aboutthe end of aging. The challenges areenormous, and maybe it is unachievable.But it is conceivable that people alivetoday might be the first to profit fromeffective anti aging therapy. All wemight need is for someone to convince asmart billionaire to make it their nextproblem to solve. On a bigger scale wecertainly could solve many problems byhaving a modified population. Engineeredhumans might be better equipped to copewith high-energy food, eliminating manydiseases of civilization like obesity.In possession of a modified immunesystem with a library of potentialthreat, we might become immune to mostdiseases that haunt us today.Even further into the future we couldengineer humans to be equipped forextended space travel and to cope withdifferent conditions on other planet,which would be extremely helpful inkeeping us alive in our hostile universe.Still a few major challenges await us.Some technological, some ethical.Many of you watching will feel uncomfortable andfear that we will create a world inwhich we will reject non-perfect humansand preselect features and qualitiesbased on our idea of what's healthy.The thing is we are already living inthis world. Tests for dozens of geneticdiseases or complications have becomestandard for pregnant womenin much of the world.Often, the mere suspicion of a geneticdefect can lead to the end of pregnancy.Take Down Syndrome for example: one ofthe most common genetic defects.In Europe, about ninety percent of allpregnancies where it's detected areterminated. The decision to terminatepregnancy is incredibly personal, butit's important to acknowledge thereality that we are preselecting humansbased on medical conditions. There isalso no use in pretending this willchange, so we have to act carefully andrespectfully as we advance thetechnology and can make more and moreselections. But none of this will happensoon: as powerful as CRISPR is, and itis, it's not infallible yet. Wrong editstill happen as well as unknown errorsthat could occur anywhere in the DNA andmight go unnoticed. The gene edit mightachieve the desired resultdisabling a disease, but also mightaccidentally trigger unwanted changes.We just don't know enough yet about thecomplex interplay of our genes to avoidunpredictable consequences. Working onaccuracy and monitoring methods is amajor concern as the first human trialsbegin. And since we've discussed apossible positive future, there aredarker visions too.Imagine what a state like North Koreacould do if they embraced geneticengineering. Could a state cement itsrule forever by forcing gene editing ontheir subjects? What would stop atotalitarian regime from engineering anarmy of modified super soldiers? It isdoable in theory? Scenarios like this oneare far far off into the future, if theyever become possible at all. But thebasic proof of concept for geneticengineering like this already existstoday. The technology really is thatpowerful. One of this might be a temptingreason to ban genetic editing andrelated research that would certainlybe a mistake.Banning human genetic engineering wouldonly lead to the science wandering offto a place with jurisdiction and rulesthat we are uncomfortable with. Only byparticipating can we make sure thatfurther research is guided by caution,reason, oversight and transparency.Do you feel uncomfortable now?Most of us havesomething wrong with them. In the futurethat lies ahead of us, would we have beenallowed to exist?The technology is certainly a bit scary,but we have a lot to gain and geneticengineering might just be a step in thenatural evolution of intelligentspecies in the universe. We might enddisease, we could extend our lifeexpectancy by centuries and travel tothe stars. There's no need to think smallwhen it comes to this topic.Whatever your opinion on geneticengineering, the future is approaching nomatter what. What has been insane sciencefiction is about to become our newreality, a reality full of opportunitiesand challenges.Videos like this would not be possiblewithout your donations on patreon.comIf you want to support is expandingcomplicated stuff and maybe get your ownbird in return you can do so here.

develops everywherewhere the conditions are right othersthink that earth might be the onlyliving place in the universe anothercandidate is the step of complex animalcells a very specific thing happened onthis step and as far as we know ithappened exactly once a primitive huntercells swallowed another cell but insteadof devouring it the two cells formed aunion the bigger cell provided

dangerous sopurely devastating and powerful that ithas destroyed most if not all advancedcivilizations in our galaxy overbillions of years a really daunting anddepressing hypothesis is that once

   "title": "What If We Detonated All Nuclear Bombs at Once?",
   "publishedAt": "31 Mar 2019",
   "transcription": "many of our viewers have asked us a veryserious question what if we made a bigpile of bombs and exploded every nuclearweapon in the world or at once strangelyenough we couldn't find a good source toanswer this question to our satisfactionso we gathered together a few scientiststo calculate what would happen and findan answer to this extremely importantscientific problem once and for allcurrently there are 15,000 nuclearweapons on earth the US and Russia bothhave around 7,000 well France China theUK Pakistan India Israel and North Koreaown around 1,000 between them but howmuch destructive power is this reallylet's try to put these numbers intoperspective on earth there are about4,500 cities or urban areas with atleast 100,000 inhabitants some arebigger than others so we'll assume thaton average we need three nuclear bombsto completely wipe out one city thismeans we could destroy every single cityon planet earth without nuclear arsenalkilling more than three billion peopleroughly half of humanity in an instantand we'd still have 1,500 nuclearweapons left now that's what an expertwould call overkill so we can say withconfidence that we had a lot of nuclearweapons and they can do a lot of damagebut what if we make a huge pile of all15,000 bombs and pull the trigger let'sdrop our nuclear pile in the middle ofthe Amazon rainforest just a show naturewho's boss our warheads piledhaphazardly fit into a small warehouse atypical US warhead has the power of twohundred thousand tons of TNT so fifteenthousand warheads would be theequivalent of three billion tons of TNTfor scale this is enough to rebuild thewhole island of Manhattan with everybuilding and skyscraper using stacks ofTNT the closest thing we can compare tothe energy gathered here is a volcanothe deadliest volcanic eruptions inrecorded history took place in 1883 onthe island of Krakatoa the eruption wasso powerful that 70% of the island andthe surrounding archipelago wasdestroyed killing tens of thousands ofpeople its effects were felt around theworld four days after the eventour nuclear pile contains 15 times theenergy of the Krakatoa volcanic eruptionso let's finally push the button threetwo one in a second a fireball 50kilometers across vaporizes everythingin its way and creates a blast wave thatflattens 3000 square kilometres offorest every living thing within 250kilometers will start to burn theexplosion will be heard literally aroundthe world as the pressure wave circlesthe earth tens of times over the nextfew weeks millions of tons ofincinerated

much of the fallout is carriedhigh into the atmosphere by the mushroomcloud and carried around the planet theamount of radioactive material in theenvironment doubles worldwide whichstill isn't civilization ending but wemay see more cancer for a while aportion of the particles will flow tothe edge of space for years and cause anuclear winter that could lower globaltemperatures by a few degrees for a fewyears this explosion was pretty bad ifyou're in South America and especiallyBrazil the Amazon rainforest is prettymuch history which is not great buthuman life will go onokay but what if we explode more nuclearweapons let's suppose humanity decidedto mine every bit of uranium on earthand build as many nuclear bombs aspossible at current usage it's estimatedthat there are around 35 million tons ofuranium in Earth's crust enough to powerhuman civilization for over 2,000 yearsor to build millions of nuclear warheadsfor the sake of argument let's say wecreate a pile with the yield of 10billion Hiroshima bombs which makes up acube three kilometers high that containsroughly the energy of the asteroidimpact that ended the age of thedinosaurs 65 million years ago exceptit's also nuclear three to one how pileexplodes in a fireball stretching sohigh into the skythat it's visible from half of SouthAmerica with so much power that theground just splashes like water forminga crater

   "title": "The Black Hole Bomb and Black Hole Civilizations",
   "publishedAt": "22 Apr 2018",
   "transcription": "Black holes are the largest collectionsof pure, violent energy in the Universe.If you come too close, they\u2019ll devour youand add your energy to their collection.And so, the energy is lost to us forever.Or is it? It turns out there\u2019s a Universe cheat code.A way of powering civilisations until the very death of everything,or of constructing the largest bomb in the Universe.But how?Didn\u2019t we learn that all energy is trappedforever in black holes, even light?This is true.Everything you think you know about the weirdest thing inthe Universe is about to get weirder, for one simple reason:Black holes are spinning.When really, really massive stars die, their corescollapse under their own gravity into black holes.This means something very big becomes very, very tiny.Like the tiniest anything can be in this universe.But stars are rotating, and a fundamental property of our universeis that things that are spinning don\u2019t want to stop spinning.We call this angular momentum,and this angular momentum can\u2019t go away. A bigthing that spins and becomes smaller spins faster.So, as the core of a star collapses, its momentum makes it spinfaster and faster and faster until it collapses into a black hole.And the black hole keeps on spinning inconceivably fast.Some of them spin millions of times a second.Just like non-spinning black holes,spinning black holes have an event horizon, and a singularityat their core where all of their mass is concentrated.The singularity is usually described as a singleinfinitely small point with no surface area.But points can\u2019t rotate, so a rotating singularity can\u2019t be a point.Instead, it\u2019s a \u201cring-ularity\u201d.A ringularity is a ring with a thickness of zero and no surface,spinning extremely fast, containing all the mass of the black hole.The black hole is spinning so fast that it morphs space and time itself.It literally drags space with it, such is its power.This creates a new and super weird region of spacetime,the ergosphere, which envelops the black hole.If space and time are completely broken inside the eventhorizon, then they\u2019re only half-broken inside the ergosphere.Inside the ergosphere, nothing makes sense.It\u2019s possible to enter it and then leave it again,but it\u2019s probably not a great experience.You can imagine it like this: falling into astatic black hole is like sliding down a hole.Being inside the ergosphere of a spinningblack hole is like spiralling down a deadly drain.The black hole transfers its own kinetic energy in theform of rotation, to everything that enters the ergosphere.The ringularity makes you dance whether you want to or not.You need to move faster than the speed of lightjust to stand still here, which is impossible.But here\u2019s our cheat code: we can steal thisenergy, and there\u2019s a lot of energy to steal.Take the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way.We could steal as much energy from it as every singlestar in the Milky Way emits in a billion years, combined.The easiest way to steal this energy is, oddlyenough, to drop something into the black hole.We\u2019ve seen that the ringularity forcesenergy on us when we enter the ergosphere,which is a lot like being in a whirlpool withspacetime rushing around and around.If you\u2019re clever, you can use the water toyour advantage and swim faster than before.In practise, this means sending a rocket into theergosphere and making a trade with the black hole:We give it some mass-energy, and it gives us some of its rotational energy.But it\u2019s not a fair trade. We get the better deal.Normally, if you fire a rocket you exchangechemical energy for kinetic energy.This is like pushing yourself forward in a swimming pool.But if you fire a rocket inside the ergosphere,it\u2019s like pushing yourself forward in a wave pool.The rotational energy of the waves gives you a muchstronger boost than you could get just by pushing yourself.The boost from the rotation of the black hole is so big that youleave the ergosphere with much more energy than you entered it.The black hole gives a tiny amount of itsrotational energy to you and slows down a little.Obviously, this requires a lot of food.Fortunately, black holes aren\u2019t picky eaters.An advanced future civilisation would probably harvest asteroidsto drop them into the black hole when they needed an energy boost.But there\u2019s an even better way to get energy from a black hole, and oddlyenough, it builds the biggest bomb any living thing could every hope to build.We only need two things to build a black holebomb: a fast spinning black hole and a big mirror.The mirror has to completely envelop the black hole,which is similar to a Dyson Sphere \u2013 a megastructurethat harvests the energy of an entire star.Although, our mirror would be easier to build.Mirrors are simpler, and black holes aremuch, much more compact than stars.If we made the mirror ten centimetres thick, the metal of a big asteroid wouldprobably be enough material for a black hole with the mass of our Sun.Once our mirror is in place, we only need to open a windowand shoot electromagnetic waves at the black hole.You can imagine what happens next by imagining tossinga ball at a wall, and it coming back faster than a bullet.The waves hit the black hole at lightspeed.A small proportion of the waves falls pastthe event horizon to disappear forever.But a much larger amount sloshes through the ergosphere,where the black hole forces some of itsrotational energy on them and amplifies them.They now begin superradiant scattering,which are fancy science words meaning\u201cbouncing around between mirror and black hole and getting stronger\u201d.Every time they go around, they are getting exponentially stronger.By opening some windows in the mirror, we can extractthe energy from the waves as fast as they grow.Which we could use, in theory, to create, what would be for all practicalpurposes, an endless source of energy for trillions of years.Or, we could blow it up.If the waves are not released, they willcontinue to get stronger and stronger,and take more and more energy fromthe black hole until the mirror shatters.A supermassive black hole would release as much energy as a supernova,making the bomb the largest explosion any living being could ever create.The beauty of the black hole bomb, the Penrose processand the superradiant scattering, is that they are not science fiction.In the far, far future, this might be theonly way to survive in our dying universe.After all the red dwarfs have cooled down and all the white dwarfstransformed into black dwarfs, the Universe will turn dark forever.Rotating black holes might be the only sources ofenergy in the entire Universe that life could harvest.If so, the last living being in existence mightone day end its life around a black hole.Which is equally chilling and uplifting.It turns out that even without any light, there are places we can go.Black holes are as interesting as they are mysterious,but there\u2019s actually a surprising amount we do know.Using maths, we can calculate things and come upwith theories about how we die if we fall into them.If you\u2019re the sort of person who gets excited aboutmaths and calculating these things for yourself,our friends at Brilliant have put together a fantasticblack hole quiz to help you get your head around them.Brilliant is a problem-solving website that teaches you tothink like a scientist, by guiding you through the problems.They take concepts like these, break them up into bite-sized pieces, presentclear thinking in each part, and then build back up to an interesting conclusion.If you visit Brilliant.org/nutshell or click the link in the description,you can sign up for free and learn all kinds of cool stuff.And as a bonus for Kurzgesagt viewers, the first six hundred andeighty-eight people will also get 20% off their annual membership.If you want to truly learn about black holes and supportKurzgesagt, this is one of the best ways to do it.",

stardies in a supernova explosion thisproduces either a neutron star or if thestar is massive enough the entire massof the core collapses into a black holeif you looked at a black hole what you'dreally be seeing is the event horizonanything that crosses the event horizonneeds to be traveling faster than thespeed of light to escape in other wordsit's impossible so we just see a blacksphere reflecting nothing but if theevent horizon is the black part what isthe whole part of the black hole thesingularity we're not sure what it isexactly a singularity may be infinitelydense meaning all its mass isconcentrated into a single point inspace with no surface or volumen orsomething completely differentnow we just don't know it's like adividing by zero error by the way blackholes do not suck things up like avacuum cleaner if we were to swap theSun for an equally massive black holenothing much would change for Earthexcept that we would freeze to death ofcourse what

   "title": "Loneliness",
   "publishedAt": "17 Feb 2019",
   "transcription": "Everybody feels lonely from time to timeWhen we have no one to sit next to at lunchWhen we move to a new cityor when nobody has time for us at the weekend.But over the last few decad es,this occasional feeling has become chronic for millions.In the UK, 60% of 18 to 34 year old say they often feel lonely.In the US, 46% of the entire population feel lonely regularly.We are living in the most connected time in human history,and yet, an unprecedented number of us feel isolated.Being lonely and being alone are not the same thing.You can be filled by bliss by yourself, and hate every second surrounded by friends.Loneliness is a purely subjective, individual experience.If you feel lonely,you are lonely.A common stereotype is that loneliness only happens to people who don't know how to talk to people,or how to behave around others.But population-based studies have shown that social skills makepractically no difference for adults when it comes to social connections.Loneliness can affect everybody.Money, fame,power, beauty,social skills, a great personality\u2014nothing can protect you against loneliness,because it's part of your biology.Loneliness is a bodily function, like hunger.Hunger make you pay attention to your physical needs;loneliness makes you pay attention to your social needs.Your body cares about your social needs,because millions of years ago,it was a great indicator of how likely you were to survive.Natural selection rewarded our ancestors for collaboration,and for forming connections with each other.Our brains grew and became more and more fine-tunedto recognize what others thought and felt, and to form and sustain social bonds.Being social became part of our biologyYou were born into groups of 50 to 150 people,which you usually stayed with for the rest of your life.Getting enough calories, staying safe and warm,or caring for offspring was practically impossible alone.Being together meant survival,being alone meant death.So it was crucial that you got along with others.For you ancestors, the most dangerous threat to survivalwas not being eaten by a lion,but not getting the social vibe of your group and being excluded.To avoid that, your body came up with \"social pain\".Pain of this kind is is an evolutionary adaptation to rejection.A sort of early warning system to make sure you stop behaviour that would isolate you.Your ancestors who experienced rejection as more painfulwere more likely to change their behaviour when they got rejected,and thus stayed in the tribe, while those who did not got kicked outand most likely died.That's why rejections hurt,and even more so, why loneliness is so painful.These mechanisms for keeping us connectedworked great for most of our history,until humans began building a new world for themselvesThe loneliness epidemic we see today really only started in the late Renaissance.Western culture began to focus on the individual.Intellectuals moved away from the collectivism of the Middle Ages,while the young Protestant theology stressed individual responsibility.This trend accelerated during the Industrial Revolution.People left their villages and fields to enter factories.Communities that had existed for hundreds of years began to dissolve,while cities grew.As our world rapidly became modern,this trend sped up more and more.Today, we move vast distances for new jobs,love, and education,and leave our social net behind.We meet fewer people in person,and we meet them less often than in the past.In the US, the mean number of close friends dropped from3 in 1985 to 2 in 2011.Most people stumble into chronic loneliness by accident.You reach adulthood and become busy with work,university,romance,kids,and Netflix.There's just not enough time.The most convenient and easy thing to sacrifice is time with friends.Until you wake up one day and you realise that you feel isolated,that you yearn for close relationships.But it's hard to find close relationships as adults,and so, loneliness can become chronic.While humans feel pretty great about things like iPhones and spaceships,our bodies and minds are fundamentally the same they were 50,000 years agoWe are still biologically fine-tuned to being with each other.large scale studies have shown that the stress that comes from chronic lonelinessis among the most unhealthy things we can experience as humansit makes you age quicker it makes cancer deadlierAlzheimer's advance fasteryour immune systems weakerloneliness is twice as deadly as obesityand as deadly as smoking a pack of ciggarettes a daythe most dangerous thing about it is that once it becomeschronic it can become self sustainingphysical and social pain usecommon mechanisms in your brainboth feel like a threatand so social pain leads to immediateand defensive behaviourwhen it's inflicted on youwhen loneliness becomes chronicyour brain goes into self preservation modeit starts to see danger and hostility everywherebut that's not allsome studies found that when you're lonely your brain is much morereceptive and alert to social signalswhile at the same time it gets worse atgets worse at interpreting them correctlyyou pay more attention to others but you understand them lessthe part of you brain that recognises facesget out of tune and becomes morelikely to categorise neutral faces as hostilewhich makes it distrustful of othersloneliness make you assume the worst about others intentions towards youbecause of this perceived hostile worldyou can become more self-centred to protect yourselfwhich can make you appear more cold unfriendly andsocially awkward than you really areif loneliness has become a strong presence in your lifethe first thing you can do is to try to recognisevicious cycle you may be trapped init usually goes something like thisan initial feeling of isolation leads to feelings oftension and sadnesswhich makes you focus you attention selectively on negativeinteractions with othersthis makes your thoughts about yourself and others more negativewhich then changes your behaviouryou begin to avoid social interactionwhich leads to more feelings of isolationthis cycle becomes more severeand harder to escape each timeloneliness make you sit far away from others in classnot answer the phone when friends calldecline invitations until the invitations stopeach and every one of us has a story aboutourselves and if your story becomes thatpeople exclude you others pick up on thatand so the outside world can become the way you feel about itthis is often a slow creeping process that takes yearsand can end in depressionand a mental state that can prevent connections even if you yearn for themthe first thing you can do to escape it is to acceptthat loneliness is a totally normal feelingand nothing to be ashamed ofliterally everybody feels lonely at some point in theirlife its a universal human experienceyou can't eliminate or ignore a feeling untilit goes away magically but you can accept thatyou feel it and get rid of its causeyou can self examine what you focus your attention onand check if you are selectively focusing onnegative thingswas this interaction with a colleague rarely negativeor was it really mutual or even positivewhat was the actual content of an interaction?what did the other person say?did they say something bad or did you addextra meaning to their wordsmaybe another person was not really reacting negatively butjust short on timethen there are your thoughts about the worldare you assuming the worst about others intentionsdo you enter a social situation and havealready decided how it will go?do you assume others don't want you around?are you trying to avoid being hurt and not risking opening upand if so can you try to give othersthe benefit of the doubt can you just assumethat they're not against youcan you risk being open and vulnerable again?and lastly your behaviourare you avoiding opportunities to be around othersare you looking of oppertunites to decline invitationsor are you pushing away others preemptively to protect yourselfare you acting as if you are getting attackedare you really looking for new connectionsor have you become complacent with your situationof course every person in each situation is uniqueand different and just in introspection alonemight not be enoughLEGAL DISCLAIMERif you feel unable to solve your situation alone by yourselfplease try to reach out and get professional helpits not a sign of weakness but of couragehowever we look at loneliness as a purely individualproblem that needs solving to createhappiness or as a public health crisisit is something that deserves more attentionhumans have build a world that is nothing short of amazingand yet not of the shiny things we have made is able tosatisfy or substituteour fundamental and biological need for connectionmost animals get what they need from their physical sourroundingswe get what we need from each otherand we need to build our artificial human worldbased on that(giggling)lets try something together lets reach out to someone todayregardless if you feel a little bit lonelyor want to make someone else day bettermaybe write a friend you haven't spoken to in a whilecall a family member who has become estrangedinvite a work buddy for a coffeeor just go to something you are usually to afraid to go toor too lazy to go to like a DMD eventor a sports clubeverybody is different so you know whats good for youmaybe nothing will come of it and that's okaydon't do this with any expectationsthe goal is just to open up a bitto exercise your connection muscles so that they can grow stronger over timeor to help others exercise themwe want to recommend two of the books we readwhile researching this videoa book that addressesamong other topicshow to deal with loneliness in a way that we found helpful and actionableandloneliness, social nature and the need for social connectionby John T. Cacloppo & William Patrickit's an entertaining and scientific explorationas to why we experience loneliness on a biologicallevel how it's spread in societyand what science has to say on how to escape itlinks for both books in the video description",

   "title": "How Far Can We Go? Limits of Humanity.",
   "publishedAt": "12 May 2016",
   "transcription": "Is there a border we will never cross?Are there places we will never reach, no matter how hard we try?Turns out there are.Even with science fiction technology, we are trapped in our pocket of the universe.How can that be?And how far can we go?We live in a quiet arm of the Milky Waya spiral galaxy of average size about one hundred thousand light years across,consisting of billions of stars, gas clouds,dark matter, black holes, neutron stars, and planets,with a supermassive black hole in the galactic centre.From afar, our galaxy seems dense, but in realityit consists mostly of empty spaceWith our current technology, sending a human to the closest star will take thousands of yearsSo our galaxy is... pretty big.The Milky Way is not alone, though.Along with the Andromeda galaxy and more than fifty dwarf galaxies,it's part of the \"local group\"a region of space about ten million light years in diameterIt is one of hundreds of galaxy groups in the Laniakea Supercluster.Which itself is only one of millions of superclusters that make up the observable universe.Now, let's assume for a moment that we have a glorious future.Humanity becomes a type 3 civilization, does not get wiped out by aliens,and develops interstellar travel based on our current understanding of physics.In this best case scenario, how far could we possibly go?Well,the Local Group.It is the biggest structure that humanity will ever be a part of.While it is certainly huge, the Local Group accounts for only 0.00000000001% of the observable universe.Let this number sink in for a moment.We are limited to a hundred billionth of a percent of the observable universe.The simple fact that there is actually a limit for us,and that there is so much universe that we will never be able to touch is kind of frightening.Why can't we go further?Well, it all has to do with the nature of nothing.Nothing, or empty space, isn't empty but has energy intrinsic to itself,so-called quantum fluctuations.On the smallest scale, there is constant action.Particles and anti-particles appearing and annihilating themselves.You can imagine this quantum vacuum as a bubbling pot with denser and less dense regions.Now, let's go back 13.8 billions of years, when the fabric of space consisted of nothing at all.Right after the Big Bang, in a event known as cosmic inflation,the observable universe expanded from the size of a marble to trillions of kilometres in fractions of a second.This sudden stretching of the universe was so fast and extremethat all of those quantum fluctuations were stretched as well,and subatomic distances became galactic distances.With dense, and less dense regions.After inflation, gravity began to pull everything back together.At the larger scale, the expansion was too quick and powerful to overcome,but at smaller scales gravity emerged victorious.So, over time, the denser regions or pockets of the universe...grew into groups of galaxies like the one we live in today.Only stuff inside our pocket, the Local Group, is bound to us gravitationally.But wait, what's the problem then?Why can't we travel from our pocket to the next one?Here, dark energy makes everything complicated.About six billion years ago, dark energy took over.It's basically an invisible force or effect that causes and speeds up the expansion of the universe.We don't know why, or what dark energy is. But we can observe its effect clearly.In the early universe there were larger cold spots around the Local Group...that grew into large clusters with thousands of galaxies.We are surrounded by a lot of stuff.But none of those structures and galaxies outside of the Local Group are gravitationally bound to us.So the more the universe expands,the larger the distance between us and other gravitational pockets becomes.Over time, dark energy will push the rest of the universe away from us,causing all the other clusters, galaxies and groups to eventually become unreachable.The next galaxy group is already millions of light years away.But all of them are moving away from us at speeds we can't ever hope to match.We could leave the Local Group and fly through intergalactic space into the darkness,but we would never arrive anywhere.While we will become more and more stranded,the Local Group will become more tightly bound and merge together to form one giant elliptical galaxywith the unoriginal name: Milkdromeda... In a few billion years.But it becomes even more depressing.At some point, the galaxies outside the Local Group will be so far away...that they will be too faint to detect ...and the few photons that do make it to us will be shifted to such long wavelengths that they will be undetectable.Once this happens, no information outside the Local Group will be able to reach us.The universe will recede from view.It will appear to be dark and empty in all directions,forever.A being born in the far future in Milkdromeda will think there is nothing but its own galaxy in the entire universe!When they look far into empty space, they will only see more emptiness and darkness.They won't be able to see cosmic background radiation, and they won't be able to learn about the Big Bang.They will have no way of knowing what we know today.The nature of the expanding universe, when it began, and how it will end.They will think the universe is static and eternal.Milkdromeda will be an island in the darkness, slowly getting darker and darker.Still, with its trillion stars,the Local Group is certainly large enough for humanity.After all, we still haven't figured out how to leave our Solar System...and we have billions of years to explore our galaxy.We have the incredible luck to exist at the perfect moment in time,to see not only our future, but also our most distant past.As isolated and remote as the Local Group is,we can perceive the entire universe, grand and spectacular, as it is right now.This video was sponsored by squarespace.com/nutshell.Do you feel isolated in a humongous universe?Why not set up a website or blog and share your thoughts without a humanoid around you!Squarespace lets you do that with easy to understand tools very quicklyand without any knowledge of web design.You can use the code 'nutshell' to save ten percentand support Kurzgesagt in making more videos about our place in the universe.Thanks so much for the help of the video to Ethan Seagal.

the more welearn the more complicated and weird ourstories become some of them so much sobut it's really hard to know whatthey're actually about like stringtheory a famous controversial and

upclose and were amazed wondrouslandscapes in the dust zoos of bizarrecreatures complex protein robots all ofthem made from structures of moleculesmade up of countless even smaller thingsatoms we thought they were the finallayer of reality until we smash themtogether really hard and discoveredthings that can't be divided any moreelementary particles but now we had aproblem they're so small that we couldno longer look at them think about itwhat is seeing to see something we needlight an electromagnetic wave this wavehits the surface of the thing and getsreflected back from it into your eye thewave carries information from the objectthat your brain uses to create an imageso you can't see something withoutsomehow interacting with it seeing istouching an active process not a passiveone this is not a problem with mostthings but particles are very very verysmall so small that the electromagneticwaves we use to see aren't too big totouch them visible light just passesover them we can try to solve this bycreating electromagnetic waves with moreand much smaller wavebut more wavelengths means more energyso when we touch a particle with a wavethat has a lot of energy it alters it bylooking at a particle we change it so wecan't measure elementary particlesprecisely this fact is so important thatit has a name the Heisenberg uncertaintyprinciple the basis of all quantumphysics so what does a particle looklike then what is its nature we don'tknow if we look really hard we can see ablurry sphere of influence but not theparticles themselveswe just know they exist but if that'sthe case how can we do any science withthem we did what humans do and inventeda new story a mathematical fiction thestory of the point particle we decidedthat we would pretend that a particle isa point in space any electron is a pointwith a certain electric charge and acertain mass all indistinguishable fromeach other this way physicists coulddefine them and calculate all of theirinteractions this is called quantumfield theory and solved a lot ofproblems all of the standard model ofparticle physics is built on it and itpredicts lots of things very well somequantum properties of the electron forexample have been tested and areaccurate up to zero point zero zero zerozero zero zero zero zero zero zero zerozero two percent so while particles arenot really pointed by treating them asif they were we get a pretty goodpicture of the universe not only thatthis idea advanced science it also ledto a lot of real-world technology we useevery day but there's a huge problemgravity in quantum mechanics allphysical forces are carried by certainparticles but according to Einstein'sgeneral relativity gravity is not aforce like the others in the universeif the universe is a play particles arethe actors but gravity is the stage toput it simply gravity is a theory ofgeometry the geometry of space-timeitself of distances which we need todescribe with absolute precision butsince there is no way to preciselymeasure things in the quantum world ourstory of gravity doesn't work with ourstory of quantum physics when physiciststried to add gravity to the story byinventing a new particle theirmathematics broke down and this is a bigproblem if we could marry gravity toquantum physics and the standard modelwe would have the theory of everythingso very smart people came up with a newstory they asked what is more complexthan a point a line or a string stringtheory was bornwhat makes string theory so elegant isthat it describes many differentelementary particles as different modesof vibration of the string just like aviolin string vibrating differently cangive you a lot of different notes astring can give you different particlesmost importantly this includes gravitystring theory promise to unify allfundamental forces of the universe thiscaused enormous excitement and hypestring theory quickly graduated to apossible theory of everythingunfortunately string theory comes with alot of strings attachedmuch of the maths involving a consistentstring theory does not work in ouruniverse with its three spatial and onetemporal dimensions string theoryrequires ten dimensions to work out sostring theorists dip calculations inmodel universes and then try to get ridof the six additional dimensions anddescribe our own universe but so farnobody has succeeded and no predictionof string theory has been proven in anexperiment so string theory did notreveal the nature of our universeone could argue that in this case stringtheory ready isn't useful at all scienceis all about experiments and predictionsif we can't do those why should webother with strings it really is allabout how we use it physics is based onmathstwo plus two makes four this is true nomatter how you feel about it and themaths in string theory does work outthat's why string theory is still usefulimagine that you want to build a cruiseship but you only have blueprints for asmall rowing boat there are plenty ofdifferences the engine the materials thescale but both things are fundamentallythe same things that float so bystudying the rowing boat blueprints youmight still learn something about how tobuild a cruise ship eventually withstring theory we can try to answer somequestions about quantum gravity thathave been puzzling physicists fordecades such as how black holes work orthe information paradox string theorymay point us in the right direction whenused in this spirit string theorybecomes a precious tool for theoreticalphysicists and help them discover newaspects of the quantum world and somebeautiful mathematics so maybe the storyof string theory is not the theory ofeverything but just like the story ofthe point particle it may be anextremely useful story we don't yet knowwhat the true nature of reality is butwe'll keep coming up with stories to tryand find out until one day hopefully wedo know this video was supported by theSwiss National Science Foundation

times larger and 317 times more massive than Earth,and more or less made of the same stuff as our sun.Just much, much less of it.The transition toward stars begins with been dwarfs,failed stars that are a huge disappointment to their mums.They have between 13 and 90 times the mass of Jupiter.So even if we took 90 Jupiters, and threw them at each other,although fun to watch, it wouldn't be enough to create a star.Interestingly, adding lots of mass to a brown dwarf doesn't make it much bigger,just it's insides denser.This increases the pressure in the core enough, to make certain nuclear reactions happen slowly,and the object glow a little.So brown dwarfs are a sort of glowy gas giantthat don't fit into any category very well.But we want to talk about stars not failed wannabe stars, so let's move on.Main sequence starsOnce large gas balls pass a certain mass threshold,their core become hot and sense enough to ignite.Hydrogen is fuss to helium in their cores, releasing tremendous amounts of energy.Stars that do that, are called main sequence stars.The more massive a main sequence star is, the hotter and brighter it burns, and the shorter its life is.Once the hydrogen burning phase is over, stars grow,Up to hundreds of thousand of times their original size.But these giant phases only last for a fraction of their lifespan.So we'll be comparing stars at drastically different stages in their lives.This doesn't make them less impressive,But maybe it's good to keep in mind that we'll be comparing babies to adults.Now, back to the beginning.The smallest real star, are red dwarfs, about 100 times the mass of Jupiter,Barely massive enough to fuse hydrogen to helium.Because they're not very massive, they are small, not very hot and shine pretty dimly.They are the only stars in the main sequence that don't grow when they diebut sort of... fizz out.Red dwarfs are by far the most abundant type [of stars] in the universeBecause they burn their fuel very slowly, it lasts them up to ten trillion years,a thousand times the current age of the universe.For example, one of the closest stars to Earth is a red dwarf star, Barnard's star.shines too dimly to be seen without a telescopeWe made a whole video on red dwarfs if you want to learn more.The next stage are stars like our sun.To say the sun dominates the solar system is not doing it justice,since it makes up 99.6% of all it's mass.It burns far hotter and brighter than red dwarfs which reduced its lifetime to about 10 billion years.The sun is 7 times more massive than Barnard's star,but that makes it nearly 300 times brighter, with twice it's surface temperature.Let's go bigger.Small changes in mass produce enormous changes in a main sequence star's brightness.The brightest star in the night sky, Sirius A, is two solar masses, with a radius  1.7 times that of the sun.But it's surface is nearly 10,000\u2103, making it shine 25 times brighter.Burning that hot reduces it's total lifespan by 4 times, to 2.5 billion years.Stars close to ten times the mass of our sun have surface temperatures near 25,000\u2103.Beta Centauri contains two of these massive stars, each shining with about 20,000 times the power of the sun.That's a lot of power, coming from something only 13 times larger [than the sun].But they'll only burn for about 20 million yearsEntire generations of these blue stars die in the time it takes the sun to orbit the GalaxySo is this the formula?The more massive, the larger the star.The most massive star that we know is R136a1.It has 315 solar masses, and is nearly 9 million times brighter than the sun.And yet, despite its tremendous mass and power, it's barely 30 times the size of the sun.The star is so extreme and barely held together by gravity that it loses321 thousand billion tonnes of material through its stellar wind.Every single second.Stars of this sort are extremely rare because they break the rules of star formation a tiny bit.When supermassive stars are born, they burn extremely hot and bright,and this blows away any extra gas that could make them more massive.So the mass limit for such a star is around 150 times the sunStars like R136a1 are probably formed through the merging of several high mass starsin dense star forming regions, and burn their core hydrogen in only a few million years.So this means they are rare and short lived.From here, the trick to growing bigger isn't adding more mass,To make the biggest stars, we have to kill them.Red giantsWhen main sequence stars begins to exhaust the hydrogen in their core,It contracts, making it hotter and denser.This leads to hotter do faster fusion, which pushes back against gravity,and makes tee outer layer swell, in a giant phase.And these stars become truly giant indeed.For example Gacrux, only 30% more massive than the sun,It has swollen to about 84 times it's radius.Still, when the sun enters the last stage of its life, it will swell and become even bigger.200 times its current radius.In this final phase of its life, it will swallow the inner planets.And if you think that's impressive, let's finally introduce the largest stars in the universeHypergiantsHypergiants are the giant phase of the most massive stars in the universe.They have an enormous surface area that can radiate an insane amount of light.Being so large, They're basically blowing themselves apart, as gravity at the surface is too weakto hold on to the hot mass which is lifted away in powerful stellar winds.Pistol star is 25 solar masses, but 300 times the radius of the sun,a blue hypergiant,  aptly named for its energetic bye star light.It's hard to say exactly how long pistol star will live,  but probably just a few million years.Even larger than the blue hypergiants, are the yellow hypergiants.The most well studied is Rho Cassiopeiae, a star so brightit can be seen with the naked eye although it's thousand of light years from Earth.At 40 solar masses, this star is about 500 times the radius of the sun and 500,000 times brighter.If the Earth was as close to Rho Cassiopeiae as it is to the sun,It would be inside it, and you would be very dead.Yellow hypergiants are very rare though.Only 15 are known.This means they're likely just a short-lived intermediate state,as a star grows or shrinks between other phases of hypergiantness.With red hypergiants, we can reach the largest stars known to us,probably the largest stars even possible.So who's the winner of this insane contest?Well, the truth is we don't know.Red hypergiants are extremely bright and far away, which means even tiny uncertainties in our measurementscan give us a huge margin of error for their size.Worse still, red hypergiants are solar system size behemoths that are blowing themselves apart,which makes them harder to measure.As we do more science and our instruments improve, whatever the largest star is change.The star that is currently thought to be among the largest we've found is Stevenson 2-18.It was probably born as a main sequence star a few tense of times the mass of the sunAnd has likely lost about half its mass by now.While typical red hypergiants are 1500 times the size of the sun,the largest rough estimate places Stevenson 2-18 at 2150 solar radii.and shining with a list half a million times the power of the sun.By comparison, the sun seems like a grain of dust.Our brains don't really have a way of grasping this kid of scale.Even at light speed,  it would take you 8.7 hours to travel around it once.The fastest plane on Earth would take about 500 yars.Dropped on the sun, it would fill Saturn's orbit.As it evolves it will probably shed even more mass, and shrink into another, hotter hypergiant phaseAccumulate heavy elements in its core before finally exploding in a core collapse supernova,giving its gas back to the galaxy.This gas will then go on to form another generation of stars of all sizes,starting the cycle of birth and death again, to light up our universe.Let's make this journey again, but this time, without the talking.The universe is big.There are many large things in it.If you want to play a bit more with size stuff, we have good news.We've created our first app, Universe in a Nutshell, together with Tim Urban, the bring behind Wait but Why.You can seamlessly travel between the smallest things in existence,past the coronavirus,human cell, and dinosaurs,all the way to the largest star and galaxies,and marvel at the whole observable universe.You can learn more about each object, or simply enjoy the sheer scale of it all.The app is inspired by the scale of the universe website by the Huang twins, that we spent a lot of time with when it came out years ago,and felt that it was finally time to create a Wait but Why and Kurzgesagt version.You can get it on your app store, there are no in-app purchases, and no ads.All future updates are included.And since this is our first app, we'd love to hear your feedback so we can improve it over time.If this sounds good to you, download the Universe in a Nutshell app now, and leave us a 5 star review if you want to support it.Kurzgesagt and all the projects we do are mostly funded by viewers, like you.So if you like the app, we'll make more digital things in future.Thank you for watching[Outro music]",

everything about ourbiology how we're builthow we experience the world how we liveand dieit does so because the physical laws aredifferent for different sized animalslife spans seven orders of

anddownsideswe'll explore these different worlds ina series of videoslet's get back to the initial questionwhy did our mousesurvive the fall because of how scalingsizechanges everything a principle thatwe'll meet over and over againvery small things for example arepractically immune to falling from greatheights because the smaller you arethe less you care about the effect ofgravityimagine a theoretical spherical animalthe size of a marbleit has three features its length itssurface area which is covered in skinand its volume or all the stuff insideit like organsmuscles hopes and dreams if we make it10 timeslonger say the size of a basketball therest of its features don't just grow10 times its skin will grow 100 timesand its insides or its volume grows by 1000 timesthe volume determines the weight or moreaccuratelymass of the animal the more mass youhavethe higher your kinetic energy beforeyou hit the ground and the stronger theimpact shockthe more surface area in relation toyour volume or mass you havethe more the impact gets distributed andsoftened and also the more airresistance will slow you downan elephant is so big that it hasextremely little surface area in ratioto its volumeso a lot of kinetic energy getsdistributed over a small spaceand the air doesn't slow it down much atall that's why it's completely destroyedin an impressive explosion of goo whenit hits the groundthe other extreme insects have a hugesurface area in relation to their tinymassso you can literally throw an ant froman aeroplane and it will not beseriously harmedbut while falling is irrelevant in thesmall world there are other forces thatare harmless for usbut extremely dangerous for small beingslike surface tension which turns waterinto a potentially deadly substance forinsectshow does it work water has the tendencyto stick to itselfits molecules are attracted to eachother through a force called cohesionwhich creates a tension on its surfacethat you can imagine as a sort ofinvisible skinfor us this skin is so weak that wedon't even notice it normallyif you get wet about 800 grams of wateror about one percent of your body weightsticks to youa wet mouse has about three grams ofwater sticking to itwhich is more than ten percent of itsbody weightimagine having eight full water bottlessticking to you when you leave theshowerbut for an insect the force of water'ssurface tension is so strongthat getting wet is a question of lifeand deathif we were to shrink you to the size ofan ant and you touch waterit would be like you were reaching intoglue it would quickly engulf youits surface tension too hard for you tobreak and you drownso insects evolve to be water repellentfor one their exoskeleton is coveredwith a thin layer of wax just like a carthis makes their surface at least partlywater repellent because it can't stickto it very wellmany insects are also covered with tinyhairs that serve as a barrierthey vastly increase their surface areaand prevent the droplets from touchingtheir exoskeletonand make it easier to get rid ofdroplets to make use of surface tensionevolution cracked nanotechnologybillions of years beforeus some insects have evolved a surfacecovered by a shortand extremely dense coat of waterrepelling hairsome have more than a million hairs persquare millimeterwhen the insect dives underwater airstays inside their furand forms a coat of air water can'tenter because the hairs are too tiny tobreak its surface tensionbut it gets even better as the oxygen ofthe air bubble runs outnew oxygen diffuses into the bubble fromthe water around it while the carbondioxide diffuses outwards into the waterand so the insect carries its ownoutside lung aroundand can basically breathe underwaterthanks to surface tensionthis is the same principle that enablespond skaters to walk on water by the waytiny anti-water hairs the smaller youget the weirder the environment becomesat some point even air becomes more andmore solidlet's now zoom down to the smallestinsects known about half the size of agrain of saltonly 0.15 millimeters long the fairy flythey live in a world even weirder thanother insectsfor them air itself is like thin jello asyrup-like mass surrounding them at alltimesmovement through it is not easy flyingon this levelis not like elegant gliding they have tokind of grab and hold onto airso their wings look like big hairy armsrather than proper insect wingsthey literally swim through the air likea tiny gross alien through syrupthings only become stranger from here onas we explore more

   "transcription": "human history is told by the energy weuse at first we had to use our musclesthen we learned to control firewe industrialized the world using coaland oil and entered the Atomic Age whenwe learned how to split a nucleus ateach step we increased our energyharvest to a scale never seen before andadvanced as a species currently we'reslowly transitioning to renewables andif we're lucky fusion energy will becomeviable in the future as humanityprogresses further if we don't destroyourselves or our habitat we will likelygain complete control of our planet'sresources at that stagewe'll probably begin to look outwardsfor new places to expand into but spaceis hard and establishing a serious humanpresence in the solar system willrequire ungodly amounts of energyluckily we know where to find it the Sunthe ultimate source of energy a furnace100 quintillion times more powerful thanour most efficient nuclear reactor itshines with the energy of a trillionnuclear bombs per second so how do weget this energy not some of it all of it[Music][Music]if we want to collect the most energyphysically possible we'll have to buildthe largest most ambitious structure inthe universe the Dyson Sphere a megastructure that encompasses a whole starto capture its power output for anintelligent species building a DysonSphere is a technological leap on a parwith the discovery of fire for ourancestors the transition from aplanetary species to an interstellarspecies it would usher in an age ofexploration and expansion on a scale wecan barely imagine so what would it looklike a solid shell enveloping the Sun isprobably not the way to go a large rigidbody like that would be vulnerable toimpacts possibly shattering it would beliable to drift and could crash straightinto the Sun a more viable design for aDyson Sphere might be a Dyson swarm anenormous set of orbiting panels thatcollect the sun's power and beam itelsewhere such as sward would givehumanity basically unlimited energy butbuilding it won't be easythe Sun is very big so we need a lot ofsatellitesif each satellite is a square kilometerwe'd need around 30 quadrillion tosurround the Sun even if they're builtas lightly as possible we need about 100quintillion tons of material and then weneed the energy to actually put theparts together and deliver them to theirpositions around the Sun on top of allthat we need to have a permanentinfrastructure set up in space to startbuilding let's assume for the purposesof this video that our descendants willtake care of that and want to create themega structure we can sort thechallenges into three main categoriesmaterials design and energy to get thevast amounts of raw materials requiredfor our Dyson swarm will have to largelydisassemble a whole planetof the planets available mercury is thebest candidate it's the closest to theSun and very metal-rich close to the Sunalso means less moving stuff around andmercury has no atmosphere and only abouta third of the surface gravity of Earthmaking it comparatively easy to launchmaterial into space next we shouldconsider the design of our swarm simpleris better conventional solar panels arefar too intricate and short lives oursatellites need to operate withoutrepairs or intervention forastronomically long times and they needto be cheap to produce but they're mostlikely going to be enormous mirrorswhich refocus sunlight to centralcollecting stations like in concentratedsolar power on earth to build and launchthem efficiently they must be incrediblylight made of little more than polishedmetal full bound to some supports andlast we need the energy to build andlaunch the swarm itself taking a part ofplanets and launching things into spacerequires an enormous amount of energyfor example if we used all the fossilfuels and uranium on earth and we wereperfectly efficient we could only launchas much mass as Mount Everest into spacea rather meager accomplishment comparedto planetary disassembly to get theenergy needed to build a Dyson Sphereit's almost as if you're going to needthe power output of a dyson sphere butthat's ok there's plenty of sunlight tobe had on Mercury so let's get to workhumans are expensive to keep alive andare very sensitive to the environment sowe'd want to automate as much aspossible ideally we'd have a small crewof controllers who oversee an army ofautonomous machines doing the actualwork there are four major pieces oftechnology required solar collectorsminers refiners and launch equipment thesolar collectors are going to give usthe energy we need to disassemble theplanet to start maybe we deploysomething like one square kilometer ofthem either as mirrors or as traditionalsolar panelsthey'll provide the energy to run ourminers which strip-mine the surface ofthe planet and our refiners whichextract valuable elements and fabricatethem into our swarm satellites to getthem into space we need a creative andefficient solution rockets aren't tooexpensive and difficult to deorbit andreuse instead we'll want to use a sortof railgun a longer electromagnetictrack which launches our satellites athigh speedsour swarm satellites will be packedtight for launch unfurling like anenormous origami once in orbit from thispoint we can take advantage ofexponential growth using the energy ofthe existing parts of the swarm to buildmore infrastructure on Mercury andlaunch new panels faster and faster eachpanel provides the energy to buildanother those to work together to buildthe next to four become eight eightbecome 16 and so on within just about 60doubling times the Sun would becompletely surrounded by solar panelsand this can happen quickly if a squarekilometer of solar collectors takes amonth to build we could be done in adecade if only our infrastructure on theplanet's surface can keep up with thequickly growing budget of energy evencollecting 1% of the sun's energy is anunbelievable change in our speciesenergy budget we could create theinfrastructure to being basicallyunlimited amounts of energy around thesolar system for all sorts of projectscolonies on other worlds terraformingplanets constructing more megastructures or even traveling to otherstars it could be the start of aninterstellar civilization based onphysics alone this is not just possiblebut easy it's such a simple process andsuch a necessary step for any species toexpand beyond their home planet thatmany astronomers think there areprobably Dyson spheres already out therein the Milky Waywe haven't spotted any yet but theycould be thereit's far from certain that humanity willever get to this point our attention istoo often focused on short-termpolitical gains and conflicts that willnot matter in the long run but if wesurvive

its physicallimits computer parts are approachingthe size of an atom to understand whythis is a problem we have to clear upsome basics a computer is made up ofvery simple components doing very simplethings representing data the means ofprocessing it and control mechanismscomputer chips contain modules whichcontain logic gates which containtransistors a transistor is the simplestform of a data processor in computersbasically a switch that can either blockor open the way for information comingthrough this information is made up ofbits which can be set to either 0 or 1combinations of several bits are used torepresent more complex informationtransistors are combined to create logicgates which still do very simple stufffor example an and gate sends an outputof 1 if all of its inputs are 1 and anoutput of 0 otherwise combinations oflogic gates finally form meaningfulmodules say for adding two numbers onceyou can add you can also multiply andonce you can multiply you can basicallydo anything since all basic operationsare literally simpler than first grademath you can imagine a computer as agroup of 7 year olds answering readybasic math questions a large enoughbunch of them could compute anythingfrom astrophysics to Zelda however withparts getting Tanya and Tanya quantumphysics are making things tricky in anutshell a transistor is just anelectric switch electricity is electronsmoving from one place to another so aswitch is a passage that can blockelectrons from moving in onedirection today a typical scale fortransistors is 14 nanometers which isabout eight times less than the HIVvirus is diameter and 500 times smallerthan a red blood cells as transistorsare shrinking to the size of only a fewatoms electrons may just transferthemselves to the other side of ablocked passage via a process calledquantum tunneling in the quantum realmphysics works quite differently from thepredictable ways we're used to andtraditional computers just stoppedmaking sense we are approaching a realphysical barrier for our technologicalprogress to solve this problemscientists are trying to use theseunusual quantum properties to theiradvantage by building quantum computersin normal computers bits are thesmallest units of information quantumcomputers use qubits which can also beset to one of two values a qubit can beany two-level quantum system such as aspin and a magnetic field or a singlephoton zero and one of this systemspossible states like the photonshorizontal or vertical polarization inthe quantum world the qubit doesn't haveto be in just one of those it can be inany proportions of both states at oncethis is called superposition but as soonas you test its value say by sending thephoton through a filter it has to decideto be either vertically or horizontallypolarized so as long as it's unobservedthe qubit is in a superposition ofprobabilities for 0 & 1 and you can'tpredict which it will bebut the instance you measure it itcollapses into one of the definiteStates superposition is a game-changerfor classical bits can be in one of twoto the power of four differentconfigurations at a timethat's 16 possible combinations out ofwhich you can use just one for qubits insuperposition however can be in all ofthose 16 combinations at once thisnumber grows exponentially with eachextra qubit twenty of them can alreadystore a million values in parallelalready weird and unintuitive propertyqubits can have is entanglement a closeconnection that makes each of the qubitsreact to a change in the other stateinstantaneously no matter how farare apart this means that when measuringjust one entangled qubits you candirectly deduce properties of itspartners without having to look qubitmanipulation is a mind bender as well anormal logic gate gets a simple set ofinputs and produces one definite outputa quantum gate manipulates an input ofsuperpositions rotates probabilities andproduces another superposition as itsoutput so a quantum computer sets upsome qubits applies quantum gates toentangle them and manipulateprobabilities and finally measures theoutcome collapsing superpositions to anactual sequence of zeros and ones whatthis means is that you get the entirelot of calculations that are possiblewith your setup all done at the sametime ultimately you can only measure oneof the results and it will only probablybe the one you want so you may have todouble check and try again but bycleverly exploiting superposition andentanglementthis can be exponentially more efficientthan would ever be possible on a normalcomputerso while quantum computers will probablynot replace our home computers in someareas they are vastly superior one ofthem is database searching to findsomething in a database a normalcomputer may have to test every singleone of its entries quantum algorithmslead only the square root of that timewhich for large databases is a hugedifference the most famous use ofquantum computers is roaning IT securityright now you're browsing email andbanking data is being kept secure by anencryption system in which you giveeveryone a public key to encode messagesonly you can decode the problem is thatthis public key can actually be used tocalculate your secret private keyluckily doing the necessary math on anynormal computer would literally takeyears of trial and error but a quantumcomputer with exponential speed-up

bendsthe rules of the universe and couldinfect and destroy everything it comesinto contact with orit could teach us about how the universebegan maybe both to understand howextreme strange matter ready is we firstneed to get a few basics what is aneutron star and how does strange matterbreak the rules of the universe to getall of this into one video we'll grosslyoversimplify a few things but we'llprovide you with further reading if youwant more details the neutron star iswhat remains after a very massive starexplodes in a supernova when thishappens the Stars core collapses underits own gravity with such a stronginward force that it squeezes nuclei andparticles together violently electronsare pushed into protons so they mergeand turn into neutrons although nothinginside of atoms is suddenly completelyfilled with particles that really don'twant to be close to each other but haveno choice they desperately push backagainst gravity against the collapse ifgravity wins they will become a blackhole if they win they become a neutronstarthis makes neutron stars like giantatomic nuclei the size of a city butholding the mass of our Sun and herethings get weird the environment in thecore of neutron stars is so extreme thatthe rules of nuclear physics change andthis could lead to a strange andextremely dangerous substance but let'snot get ahead of ourselves we first needto know the rules before we learn howthey can be broken protons and neutronsthe particles making up the nuclei ofatoms are made up of smaller particlescalled quarksquarks really don't want to be alonethey are what we call confined you cantry to separate them but the harder youpull the harder they try to pullthemselves back together if you use alot of energy they just use this energyto create new quarks quarks only existstogether as the building blocks of otherparticles and have never been observedby themselves they come in many typesbut only to appear to make stable matterthe up and down quarks found in protonsand neutrons all other quarks seem todecay away quickly but this may bedifferent insight neutron stars theforces operating in their cores are soextreme that they are actually similarto the universe shortly after the BigBang neutron star cores are like fossilswhich can let us peer back in time tothe beginning of everything so learninghow quarks behave inside a neutron staris a way of understanding the verynature of the universe itselfone hypothesis is that inside a neutronstar core protons and neutrons D confineall the particles crammedshoulder-to-shoulder dissolve and meltinto a sort of bath of quarksuncountable numbers of particles becomeone giant thing made purely from quarksquark matter a star made from this iscalled a quark star though from theoutside it may not look any differentthan a regular neutron star now we canfinally talk about the most dangeroussubstance if the pressure inside a quarkstar is great enough it may get strangerliterally in the course of neutron starssome of the quarks may be converted intostrange quarks strange quarks havebizarre nuclear properties and they areheavier and for the lack of a betterword stronger if they turn up they couldcreate strange matter strange mattermight be the ideal state of matterperfectly dense perfectly stableindestructible more stable than anyother matter in the universe so stablethat it can exist outside neutron starsif this is the case we have a problem itmight be infectious every piece ofmatter it touches might be so impressedby its stability that it wouldimmediately turn it into strange mattertwo protons and neutrons would dissolveand become part of the quark bath whichfrees energy and creates more strangematter the only way to get rid of itwould be to throw it into a black holebut then again who cares all of it isinside neutron stars except when neutronstars collide with other neutron starsor black holes they spew out tremendousamounts of their insides some of whichcould include little droplets of strangematter called strangelets strangeletsare as dense as the core of a neutronstar they could be really small maybeeven subatomic but even the largeststrangelets wouldn't be any bigger thana rocketthese strangelets would drift throughthe galaxies for millions or billions ofyears until they meet a star or planetby chance if one were to strike earth itwould immediately start converting itinto strange matter the more it convertsthe more it would grow ultimately all ofthe atoms making up earth would beconverted earth would become a hot clumpof strange matter the size of anasteroid if a strangelet strikes the Sunit would collapse into a strange stareating through it like fire through adry forest this would not change thesun's mass much but it would become wayless brightso earth would freeze to death and likea tiny virus we'd have no way to see astrangelet coming were still sometheories suggest strangelets are morethan common outnumbering all stars inthe galaxy the strangelets could haveformed very early after the Big Bangwhen it was as hot and dense as aneutron star core everywherethey might be clumping around thegravity of galaxies as the universeexpanded and evolved strangelets couldeven be so numerous and massive thatthey might actually be the dark matterwe suspect holds galaxies together butthen again maybe notthis is speculation and the earth andSun and planets haven't been consumed ina wildfire of strangelets in the pastfew billion years so the odds seem goodthat it won't happen anytime soonunderstanding these strange objectstoday may be the key to understandingthe birth of our universe and why itgrew to look the way it does now whenscientists first started playing withmagnets and wise and thinking aboutelectrons they had no idea

   "title": "Why Blue Whales Don't Get Cancer - Peto's Paradox",
   "publishedAt": "01 Mar 2020",
   "transcription": "Cancer is a creepy and mysterious thing.In the process of trying to understand it,to get better at killing it,we discovered a biological paradox that remains unsolved to this day.Large animals seem to be immune to cancer,which doesn't make any sense.The bigger a being, the more cancer it should have.To understand why we first need to take a look at the nature of cancer itself.(Kurzgesagt intro music)Our cells are protein robots made out of hundreds of millions of parts.Guided only by chemical reactionsthey create and dismantle structures,sustain a metabolism to gain energy,or make almost perfect copies of themselves.We call these complex chemical reactions pathways.They are biochemical networks upon networks,intertwined and stacked on top of each other.Most of them can barely be comprehended bya single human mind and yet they functioned perfectly...Until.. they don't.With billions of trillions of reactions happeningin thousands of networks over many years,The question is not if somethingwill go wrong, but when?Tiny mistakes add up until thegrandiose machinery gets corrupted.To prevent this from getting out of hand,our cells have kill switches thatmake them commit suicide.But these kill switches are not infallible.If they fail, a cell can turn into a cancer cell.Most of them are slained bythe immune system very quickly.But this is a numbers game.Given enough time a cell would accrue enough mistakes, slipped by unnoticed and begin making more of itself.All animals have to deal with this problem.In general the cells of differentanimals are the same size.The cells of a mouse aren't smaller than yours.It just has fewer cells in total and a shorter lifespan.Fewer cells and a short life means a lower chanceof things going wrong or cells mutating,or at least it should mean that.Humans live about 50 times longer andhave 1,000 times more cells than mice,yet the rate of cancer is basicallythe same in humans and in mice.Even waiter, blue whales with about 3,000 times more cells than humans don't seem to get cancer at all really.This is Peto's paradox.The baffling realization that large animalshave much much less cancer than they should.Scientists think there are two main ways ofexplaining the paradox; evolution and hyper tumors.Solution one: evolve or become a blob of cancer.As multicellular beingsdeveloped a 600 million years ago,animals became bigger and bigger.Which added more and more cells and hence moreand more chances that cells could be corrupted.So the collective had to investin better and better cancer defenses.The ones that did not died out.But cancer doesn't just happen.It's a process that involves many individual mistakes and mutations in several specific genes within the same cell.These genes are called proto-oncogenesand when they mutate it's bad news.For example with the right mutation,a cell will lose its ability to kill itself.Another mutation and it will develop the ability to hide.Another and it will send out calls for resources.Another one and it will multiply quickly.These oncogenes have an antagonist though;tumor suppressor genes.They prevent these critical mutations from happening or order the cell to kill itself if they decide it's beyond repair.It turns out that large animalshave an increased number of them.Because of this, elephant cells require moremutations than mice cells to develop a tumor.They are not immune but more resilient.This adaption probably comes with a cost insome form but researchers still aren't sure what it is.Maybe tumor suppressors make elephants age quicker later in life or slow down how quickly injuries heal.We don't know yet.But the solution to the paradoxmay actually be something different.\"Hypertumors\"Solution 2:  HypertumorsSolution 2: Hypertumors(Yes)Solution 2: Hypertumors(Yes, really.)Hypertumors are named afterhyperparasites: the parasites of parasites.Hypertumors are the tumors of tumors.Cancer can be thought of asa breakdown in cooperation.Normally, cells work together to form structures like organs, tissue or elements of the immune system.But cancer cells are selfish and only work for their own short-term benefit.If they're successful, they form tumors;huge cancer collectives that can be very hard to kill.Making a tumor is hard work though.Millions or billions of cancer cells multiply rapidly,which requires a lot of resources and energy.The amount of nutrients they can steal fromthe body becomes the limiting factor for growth.So the tumor cells trick the body to build new blood vessels directly to the tumor, to feed the thing killing it.And here, the nature of cancer cellsmay become their own undoing.Cancer cells are inherently unstableand so they can continue to mutate.Some of them faster than their buddies.If they do this for a while,at some point one of the copies ofthe copies of the original cancer cell,might suddenly think of itself as anindividual again and stop cooperating.Which means just like the body,the original tumor suddenly becomes an enemy,fighting for the same scarce nutrients and resources.So the newly mutated cells can create a hypertumor.Instead of helping, they cut off theblood supply to their former buddies,which will starve and kill the original cancer cells.Cancer is killing cancer.This process can repeat over and over,and this may prevent cancer frombecoming a problem for a large organism.It is possible that large animals havemore of these hyper tumors than we realize,they might just not become big enough to noticeWhich makes sense a two gram tumoris 10% of a mouse's body weight,while It's less than 0.002% of a humanand 0.000002% of a blue whale.All three tumors require the same number ofcell divisions and have the same number of cells.So an old blue whale might be filledwith tiny cancers and just not care.There are other proposed solutions to Peto's paradox,such as different metabolic ratesor different cellular architecture.But right now we just don't know.Scientists are working on the problem.Figuring out how large animals are so resilientto one of the most deadly diseases we know,could open the path to new therapies and treatments.Cancer has always been a challenge.Today, we are finally beginning to understand itand by doing so, one day we might finally overcome it.This video was sponsored by...YOU!If you want to help us make more,you can do so by supporting us on Patreon,or getting one of the beautiful things we've made,like our Space Explorer Notebook with infographicpages and unique grits to inspire your creativity,or an infographic poster bundle,or the very Kurzgesagt hoodie,or if you missed it the first time,the second run of our gratitude journal.We put a lot of time and love into our merchbecause just like with our videos,we only want to put things intothe world that we feel good about.Kurzgesagt is a project thatby rights shouldn't really work.Videos like the one you just watched take monthsto finish and we're only able to put in so much time,because of your direct support,because you watch and share and because you care.Thank you for watching.(Space-y Kurzgesagt theme)",

small vertebrate theyencounterthe biggest hunting parties can kill upto 500,000 animals per day some armyants specialized in hunting andconsuming other social insects liketermites wasps and especially other antswasps are fierce and may seeminvulnerable but if a swarm makes itsway to their colonies they don't evenstand a chance the much bigger andstronger wasps might kill a few of thembut they are quickly overwhelmed even iftheir queen survives an attack the armyants steel the colony's larvae andquickly devour them there is no recoveryfrom that when army ants discoveranother ant colony they immediatelyattack now you might think this would bea more even battle but it's not becausearmy ants act as a social unit they areespecially dangerous and effective mostarmy ants are not particularlyimpressive individually but they canoverwhelm their victims with sheernumbers before the victim colony canmount an effective defense and soinvasions tend to be won by theattackers and the prey colony is damagedsignificantly or is exterminatedinterestingly army ants don't fight armyants when two swarms encounter eachother in the wild they either passthrough each other ignoring the otherswarm or both colonies just move awaywhich makes sense from an evolutionarystandpoint army ants that fought otherarmy ants probably eradicated themselvesmillions of years ago indeed they're sodeadly that other ant species had tospecialized to survive their presencemany species just panic and evacuatetheir nest when they notice army andscouts carrying as many Lavi with themas they can in

   "transcription": "over the last decade milk has become abit controversial some people say it's anecessary and nutritious food vital forhealthy bones but others say it cancause cancer and lead to an early deathso who's right and why are we drinkingit anyway milk is the basis of everymammals diet after birth when ourdigestive systems are immature and smallbasically its power food to kick-startour bodies and help us grow milk is richin fat vitamins minerals and milk sugarlactose on top of that for a while afterbirth it also contains antibodies andproteins that protect us for infectionsand regulate our immune system but it'sa lot of effort for mothers to produceeventually humans stop drinking mother'smilk and transition to the diet of theirparents this is how it's been forthousands of years until about eleventhousand years ago when our ancestorssettled down in the first agriculturalcommunities soon they domesticated thefirst dairy animals goats sheep andcattle they found that dairy animals areable to eat useless and abundant stuffand turn it into nutritious and tastyfood this made a huge difference interms of survival especially in hardtimes so groups that had milk availablehad an evolutionary advantage andthrough natural selectionit changed the genes of communities whoconsumed a lot of it this adaptation hasto do with a specialized enzyme lactasebabies have a lot of it in their systemso they can break down the milk sugarlactose and digest milk easily but theolder we grow the fewer lactase enzymesour body produces worldwide about 65% ofthe population do not have the enzymeafter infancy which means they are notable to digest at more than about one50 milliliters each day this lactoseintolerance is not spread evenly aroundthe world though in some East Asiancommunities for example it's up to 90%in northern Europe and North America therates are the lowest overall there areprobably a few reasons for this unevendistribution the trait was firstintroduced by random mutation whichhappened independently of each other ina few populations the fact that farmingreplaced hunting and gathering more andmore created natural selection pressurepeople who were able to digest lactosehad more foods at hand which was anadvantage the migration of dairy farmersto the north then spread it furtherwhich probably pushed back populationsthere that didn't have the trait okaybut if milk has been a valuable part ofour diet for thousands of years why isit so controversial there are a numberof claims regarding the negative andpositive health effects of milk thenegative ones cover a wide variety frombrittle bones to cancer andcardiovascular diseases to intoleranceand allergies so how do they hold upsome older studies found a connectionbetween milk and a high risk of breastcolon and prostate cancer but metaanalyses found no impact on your cancerriskon the contrary the calcium in milkmight even have a protective effectagainst colon cancer although this couldbe calcium in general it's not clearmilk plays a role in this effect onlyStudies on prostate cancer showed anincreased risk for people who consumedmore than one and a quarter liters ofmilk a daybut again the association isinconsistent and other studies don'tfind any effect we discuss these studiesin more detail in our sources documentall in all the research seems to showthat if you drink between 100 to 250milliliters of milk per day cancer isnot a concernsimilarly meta-analyses could not findany impact from milk or dairy productson your risk of heart disease stroke oryour total mortality some studies evensuggested that high blood pressure mightbe rarer in people who eat a lot ofdairy although the evidence is notstrong enough to claim this withconfidence the case gets morecomplicated though when we look at bonesa number of studies found neitherpositive nor negative effects for adultswhat most people worry most about thoughare harmful amounts of pesticidesantibiotics or hormones there arehormones in milk but only in very lowconcentrations for example to get thesame amount of hormones as from the pillyou'd need to drink about five thousandlitres of milk and even if you did mosthormones would be destroyed by yourdigestive system before they couldaffect you which is the reason why somuch medication is coated to protect itfrom our digestion for pesticides andantibiotics there are regulations inmost parts of the world that only allowcompletely harmless amounts milk thatsurpasses these thresholds is notallowed to go on the Shelf so there'snothing in particular to worry aboutbesides allergies and those sufferingfrom lactose intolerance --is the bestknown negative effects of milk areprobably acne and general discomfortafter drinking milk or eating dairyproducts and here the effects are veryreal for example skimmed milk has beenfound to statistically increase the rateof acne by 24% allergies against milkproducts are especially prevalent amongchildren with one in 18 kids in Germanysuffering from them in general theseallergies tend to get better ordisappear as they grow older thoughit's milk healthy then milk no matter ifit comes from mothers cows sheep goatsor camels is a nutrient-dense food itcontains all necessary macronutrientsand many micronutrients especially inregions where people struggle to getenough calories milk can contribute to ahealthy life and lower child mortalityfor those living in the developed worldin general milk is not harmful if youare not allergic or intolerant to itespecially for children it's a good wayto get large amounts of calcium and forvegetarians it's a good source ofvitamin b12 and B vitamins in generalthis does not mean there are not otheralternatives with the same effect you donot need to drink milk to be healthymilk is also definitely not a substitutefor water milk is power food than theadditional calories from drinking a lotof it on a regular basis can contributeto being overweight especially flavoredmilk or chocolate milk is morecomparable to beverages like lemonadethan a healthy snack and there's anotherthing to consider milk production has asignificant impact on the global climateabout 33 percent of cropland is used tofeed grazing animals including dairycattle even though the carbon footprintof dairy products has declined since1990 dairy production is stillresponsible for 3 percent of allgreenhouse gas emissions even more thanall error pains combined milk is a hugeindustry and sadly most of itsproduction in factory farms

   "title": "3 Arguments Why Marijuana Should Stay Illegal Reviewed",
   "publishedAt": "10 Jun 2018",
   "transcription": "All around the world marijuana is being decriminalized or even made legalBut is this really a good idea. In the online debate the harmful sites are often downplayed?So let's look at the three most powerful arguments against legalizing marijuana Argument number one: In the last few decadesMarijuana has been engineered to become much more potentToday marijuana is so potent that it's actually a strong drug that may cause Psychosis.The main active ingredient of marijuana is THC and there's strong evidence that THC is related to psychosisregardless of other risk factorsMarijuana also contains a substance called CBD that seems to counteract this effectIt's even being tested as a treatment against psychosis and anxietybut because it doesn't make you high growers have gradually decreased the amount of CBD in marijuana over the last few decades while increasingTHC levelsSample testing showed that THC levels have risen from around 4% in the 1990s to nearly 12% in 2014Shifting the ratio of THC to CBD from 1 to 14 in 1995 to about 1 to 80 in2014 it's unclear how precise those tests were. HoweverOverall recent findings suggest that the more marijuana you consume and the stronger it is the higher your risk of developing psychosisBut how high is the risk of psychosis for the general population?a study from britain found that while marijuana use has risen significantly between1996 and 2005the number of schizophrenia cases a type of psychosis remained stablethe risk of marijuana induced psychosis remains the highest for people who already have a high risk of psychosis to begin withThem, it seems more likely that marijuana speeds up the development of their condition rather than causing it as far as we know right nowSo the reasoning goes if fewer people have access to marijuana the lower the risk of marijuana and juice psychosisBut actually you could argue that precisely because marijuana is illegalMore people will end up with psychosisprohibition makesIllegal drug stronger and more potent because this way you can ship more product in a smaller space and sell it at a greater profitthis is what happened during the prohibition of alcohol in the US where hard liquor became the normand the same is happening with marijuana nowImagine a world where liquor is the only alcohol availableYou have the choice of either not drinking at all or getting much drunker than you would like toThis is the situation for many marijuana smokers todayPeople didn't stop drinking during Prohibition and the numbers show that laws don't deter people from using marijuanawe can't make marijuana go away, but we can make it saferIf marijuana were legal. There would be more options for consumers and regulators could for example insist on a high level of CBDJust like most people don't drink an after-work bottle of vodka many people would gladly consume the after-work beer version of marijuanaArgument - marijuana is a gateway drug if it's legalized there will be a spike in the use of much more dangerous drugs a2015 study found that about45% of lifelong marijuana users took some other illegal drug at some pointLegalizing marijuana could reinforce this trend as more young people. Try legal marijuana. They might end up trying harder drugsBut it turns out that the real gateway to drug use comes much earlier cigarettesOne study showed that teens who started smoking before the age of 15 were 80%more likely to use illegal drugs than those who didn't and a2007 study found that teenagers between 12 and 17 who smoked were three times more likely to binge drinkSeven times more likely to have used drugs like heroin or cocaine and were also seven times more likely to resort to marijuanaBut if that's the case, how could making more drugs legal stop the use of hard drugs?At first it's important to acknowledge that people don't use drugs because they're legal or notIf you want to buy any drug, you'll always find someone happy to sellThe real question is why do people develop an unhealthy relationship with drugs at all?Studies show that certain conditions make people especially vulnerable to drugs and addiction a difficult childhood early traumalow social statusdepression even genetic factorsWhich drug they get addicted to is more often than not a matter of chanceAddicts take drugs to escape their problems, but drugs don't solve any of those problems and instead become a new problemBut punishing people for their unhealthy coping mechanisms doesn't change anything about the underlying causes eitherSo some argue we need to take a completely different route in2001 Portugal had one of the worst drug problems in Europe. So it was desperate enough to try something radicalPossession and use of all the legal drugs was decriminalizedHe would no longer be arrested instead authorities launched a major health campaignPeople who were found with a small amount were referred to support services and got help with treatment and harm reductionDrug use was seen as a chronic disease not a crimethe results were stunning the number of people who tried drugs and kept using them fell from44% to 28% by 2012The use of hard drugs decreased as well as HIV and hepatitis infections and overdosesMaking drugs legal might overall help society much more than it harms itArgument number threeMarijuana is addictive and unhealthy. It needs to remain illegal to keep harm at a minimumWhile marijuana addiction is more psychological than physical it is still a real problemthe demand for treatment for marijuana addiction has more than doubled in the past decade alone inTotal about 10 percent of people who try marijuana will become addictedThis is also related to higher THC levels aStudy released in 2017 tracked the potency of marijuana and Dutch coffee shops over a period of 16 yearsFor every 1% increase in THC60 more people enter treatment nationwide in terms of negative health effectsSome studies linked marijuana used to increase blood pressure and lung problems while a 2016 study found that marijuana use wasUnrelated to physical health problems except for a higher risk of gum diseaseSome studies showed that marijuana use alters teenagers brains andDecreases their intelligence, but when more recent studies took drinking and smoking into account the results were inconclusiveOverall research shows that taking any drugs while the brain is still in development is bad for youBut the truth is we don't know yet how unhealthy marijuana is we need more funding for research?Which is hard to get while marijuana remains illegalWe can put what we know into perspective though16% of people who consume alcohol become alcoholics and 32% of people who try cigarettes become smokersWe know for sure alcohol affects your brain destroys your liver and causes cancer while tobacco clogs your arteriesDestroys your lungs and also causes cancer3.3 million people die from alcohol abuse each year while smoking kills more than 6 million peopleNobody is suggesting tobacco and alcohol are harmless just because they're legal alsoNobody is seriously proposing to prohibit them even though they are extremely dangerousLegality is a way to exercise some control over them, especially when it comes to protecting young peopleIt's often much harder to buy legal drugs for teenagers than to buy illegal onesOfficial sellers can get hefty fines and lose their license if they sell to underage kidsLegality creates incentives here that drug dealers can't exploitSo making marijuana legal doesn't mean endorsing it it means taking responsibility for the risks it posesIt could also open the floodgates to tons of new research that shows us how harmful it really is. And to whomConclusionMarijuana is a drug and just like any other drugIt has negative consequences for a sizable portion of the people who use it. It is not harmlessThe best way to protect society from its negative consequences seems to be legalization and regulationThanks to our partnership with funk this video has already been available on our German channel for two weeksCheck it out and subscribe to practice your German skillsAnd if you want to support the creation of videos that take months to research and prepare and get a bunch of cool stuff inReturn you can do that on patreon dot com slash kurzgesagt",

   "title": "Optimistic Nihilism",
   "publishedAt": "26 Jul 2017",
   "transcription": "Human existence is scary and confusing.A few hundred thousand years ago, we became conscious and found ourselves in a strange place.It was filled with other beings. We could eat some; some could eat us.There was liquid stuff we could drink; things we could use to make more things.The daytime sky had a tiny yellow ball that warmed our skin.The night sky was filled with beautiful lights.This place was obviously made for us.Something was watching over us.We were home. This made everything much less scary and confusing.But the older we got, the more we learned about the world and ourselves.We learned that the twinkling lights are not shining beautifully for us, they just are.We learned that we're not at the center of what we now call the universe,and that it is much, much older than we thought.We learned that we're made of many little dead things,which make up bigger things that are not dead, for some reason,and that we're just another temporary stage in a history going back over a billion years.We learned, in awe, that we live on a moist speck of dust moving around a medium-sized starin a quiet region of one arm of an average galaxy, which is part of a galaxy group that we will never leave.And this group is only one of thousands that, together, make up a galaxy supercluster.But even our supercluster is only one in thousands that make up what we call the observable universe.The universe might be a million times bigger, but we will never know.We can throw words around like two hundred million galaxiesor trillions of stars or bazillions of planets,but all of these numbers mean nothing. Our brains can't comprehend these concepts.The universe is too big. There is too much of it.But size is not the most troubling concept we have to deal with.It's time, or, more precisely, the time we have.If you're lucky enough to live to one hundred,you have five thousand two hundred weeks at your disposal.If you're twenty-five now, then you have three thousand nine hundred weeks left.If you're going to die at seventy, then there are two thousand three hundred and forty weeks left -a lot of time, but also ... not really.And then what?Your biological processes will break down,and the dynamic pattern that is you will stop beinge dynamic.It will dissolve until there is no you left.Some believe that there is a part of us we can't see or measure,but we have no way to find out, so this life might be itand we might end up dead forever.This is less scary than it sounds, though.If you don't remember the 13.75 billion years that went by before you existed,Then the trillions and trillions and trillions of years that come after will pass in no time once you're gone.Close your eyes. Count to 1.That's how long forever feels.And as far as we know, in the end, the universe itself will die and nothing will ever change again.Our videos induce existential dread in many people,and the last few minutes probably haven't helped.So, for once, we want to offer a different way of looking at these things:an unscientific, subjective point of view, the philosophy of Kurzgesagt, if you want.Please take it with a grain of salt; we don't know any more about human existence than you do.We counter existential dread with optimistic nihilism.What do we mean by that?Well, to summarize, it seems very unlikely that 200 trillion trillion stars have been made for us.In a way, it feels like the cruelest joke in existence has been played on us.We became self-aware only to realize this story is not about us.While it is great to know about electrons and the powerhouse of the cell,Science doesn't do a lot to make this less depressing.Okay, but so what?You only get one shot at life, which is scary, but it also sets you free.If the universe ends in heat death, every humiliation you suffer in your life will be forgotten.Every mistake you made will not matter in the end.Every bad thing you did will be voided.If our life is all we get to experience, then it's the only thing that matters.If the universe has no principles, the only principles relevant are the ones we decide on.If the universe has no purpose, then we get to dictate what its purpose is.Humans will most certainly cease to exist at some point,but before we do, we get to explore ourselves and the world around us.We get to experience feelings. We get to experience food, books, sunrises, and being with each other.The fact that we're even able to think about these things is already kind of incredible.It's easy to think of ourselves as separated from everything, but this is not true.We are as much the universe as a neutron staror a black hole or a nebula.Even better, actually, we are its thinking and feeling part:the centre organs of the universe.We are truly free in a universe-sized playground,so we might as well aim to be happy and to build some kind of utopia in the stars.It's not as if we've found out everything there is to knowWe don't know why the rules of the universe are as they are,how life came into existence, what life is.We have no idea what consciousness is or if we are alone in the universe.But we can try to find some answers.There are billions of stars to visit, diseases to cure,people to help, happy feelings to be experienced,and video games to finish.There is so much to do.So, wrapping up, you've probably used up a good chunk of the time available to you.If this is our one shot at life, there is no reason not to have funand live as happy as possible.Bonus points if you made the life of other people better.More bonus points if you help build a galactic human empire.Do the things that make you feel good.You get to decide whatever this means for you.",

   "title": "What\u2019s Hiding at the Most Solitary Place on Earth? The Deep Sea",
   "publishedAt": "15 Sep 2019",
   "transcription": "Sometimes the world feels, hmm, boring.We've visited all the remote islands, conquered the Arctic, and penetrated the deepest jungles.But there is still one place to explore.It's a wet and deadly desert inhabited by mysterious creatures living in total darkness.The deep sea.Let's dive down.[\u266b Catchy Intro Jingle \u266b]When we look at the sheer scale of the Earth's oceans,It's hard to believe that less than 2% of all biomass on Earth lives here.And of that small percentage, around 90% is located close to the surface in the first 200 meters.This is where we begin our journey.Here, light can still penetrate the water which allows photosynthesis to occur.Phytoplankton, trillions and trillions of single-celled algae and bacteria make up the foundationof the ocean's ecosystem, and they're consumed by bigger plankton, who are consumer by other species.The seafloor at this depth is akin to the Amazon rainforest, and is often covered with coral reefs, algae,and other sea plants that are home to a plethora of sea animals.So far, we've focused most of our attention on this comparatively pleasant environment,where we fish, swim, pollute, and do science.So, let's dive deeper.Moving from familiar coastal waters into deeper, more remote waters, we eventually reach the edgeof the continental shelf, where we're confronted with the continental slope,the long descent down to the deep sea.With every additional meter of water, light fades drastically, which means there are basicallyno more plants, and the seemingly steep continental slope begins to remind us of the surface of the Moon.Looking out we're faced by what seems to be endless open water.Let's leave the slope behind us, and enter what's known as the Twilight Zone, the portal to the deep sea.As we sink down further, the water pressure rises to deadly levels.The deepest scuba dive ever came in at 332 meters.At that depth, the pressure is like having 200 cars stacked on top of you.Yet we've only completed 3% of our journey.While this region seems pretty grim, many fish and other animalsactually spend at least half their lives down here.During the day, it's a good place to rest and recover, hidden from predators in the vast dark waters.At night, they can travel more safely into shallower zones to feed in the food-rich surface waters.In this transition zone between Twilight and Darkness, light becomes a powerful tool.Over 90% of the species indigenous to this deep environmentuse bioluminescence chemicals to create light.They do so as camouflage against the very faint sunlight, to send signals to potential mates,or to confuse and scare attackers.Or, they use lights to hunt.Another tool for survival in the dark is teamwork.At around 700 meters, we encounter a colony of siphonophores.They can be up to 50 metres in length, but are only as wide as a broomstick.To attract prey, a colony creates a tragically beautiful bright blue or red light,and deploys a curtain of tentacles filled with toxic needles that kill anything that comes too close.But most species living down here have to rely on an unlikely resource: Marine Snow.White flaky stuff that constantly sinks from the surface to the bottom of the ocean.It consists of dead plant or animal parts,fecal matter,shells, sand, or dust.Even though this doesn't sound very tasty, without this crucial resource, life in the deep sea would starve.It's in this area that the most fascinating battles between two unlikely enemies could happen.Sperm whales hunt and attack giant squid the size of a house.While the squid fight back ferociously, they probably don't stand a chance,but they do leave permanent marks on their killer's skin.As we reach 1,000 meters, deeper than the tallest structure built by humans, we need to be careful.This is the Midnight Zone, a place of utter darkness.A barely explored wet wasteland consisting of nothing but endless black open water.At these depths, it's harder for a human to take a swim than to take a walk in space.Finding food down here is really hard, so life had to adapt, and become extremely energy-efficient.Like the 30-centimeter-long vampire squid that floats through the water without motion,with long and slender catching arms extended.They're covered in tiny stiff hairs, which brush food from the water.This saves a lot of energy compared to actively catching food.For carnivorous fish, it's much harder to find food since living prey is quite rare down here.So the hunters have to get a perfect grip on their victim on first strike. Otherwise, it will escape into the dark.Many deep-sea predators have several sets of long and deadly teeth.Like the viperfish, which uses its long fangs to trap even large prey and swallow it whole.Or the frilled shark, with its impressive set of 300 teeth,which are curved backwards to hook their victims in their mouths.We sink further.Below the 3800 mark, as deep as the grave of the Titanic, we are now at abyssal depths.Here, life happens in slow motion.Preserving every last bit of energy is crucial for survival.Everything down here hovers motionless, or swims in a slow, elegant fashion.The only time the animals living in this zone move fast is when they have to escape danger.Like the Dumbo octopod paddling with its ear-like fins, or the grenadiers fish with its slow eel-like tail beats.At 4,000 meters, we've finally reached ground again. The Abyssal Plain.It's covered in grey mud and rocks dusted with the remains of marine snow,which is consumed by animals like sea cucumbers, shrimp, sea urchins, and sea worms.In some regions of the seafloor, small dark mineral deposits can be seen.These are manganese nodules.Deep-sea corals and sponges use them to anchor themselves on the bottom of the sea.Though life is sparse on the deep sea floor, even down here there are oases.In the rift valleys, where tectonic plates are splitting apart, magma heats up seawater and creates dark jetsof water and minerals as hot as 400\u2103 (752\u2109), that form elaborate chimneys and towers.Extremophile bacteria use the minerals to create organic substances, that are the bases for unique ecosystems.As we descend further, we reach the deepest point of the abyssal plain at 6,000 meters.For most of the seafloor, this is as deep as it gets, but if we want to get to the deepest point of the oceans,we're actually only halfway there.Let's enter the Hadal Zone, the underworld of the sea.It consists of long narrow trenches that only make up around 0.25% of the oceans, and are amongthe most extreme environments on Earth.Only extremophiles exist down here, like the ethereal snailfish, that holds the record for deepest living fishever seen, at around 8,000 meters.We see spiky and sharp black rocks rush by as we sink down to more than 10,000.Until we reach the final slope, a trench inside the larger Mariana Trench with gently-sloping sidesthat enframe a valley about 1.6 kilometers wide.This is it. The deepest point, the Challenger Deep.11,000 meters below the surface.The water pressure here is 1,086 bar.Taking a swim here is like having to balance 1,800 elephants on top of you.But even here, life has found a way to thrive.Next to sea cucumbers, white and light pink amphipods wiggle their way through the water.Their size is astounding.While their shallow-water cousins are maybe a few centimetres long, the deep-sea versioncan reach up to 30 centimeters.And there are other things floating elegantly through the water.Plastic bags that were found by scientists in 2018.Even the remotest place on Earth is not safe from human influence.There's nothing left to do now and our oxygen is running out, so we begin our ascent.[\u266a Deep Sea Ambience \u266a]After hours of traveling through dark nothingness, we finally see a glimpse of light.We arrive back at a calm surface.The oceans are so deep. There is so much of them.We owe it to ourselves and to our descendants to preserve them as well as we can.There are still so many wondrous things left to be discovered.So, you're all tingly now and want to go exploring.Why not start off with some juicy science? You can use our friends from Brilliantas your springboard for a knowledge deep dive.Brilliant is a website that helps you approach science in a practical way through interactive coursesand daily problems in maths, science, and computer science.Instead of simply flooding you with information,you get the tools you need to untangle complex topics by yourself.It's hands-on learning, instead of chalk and talk.Plunge in and get to the bottom of courses about things like geometry, waves and light, gravitational physicsand many more.Click the link in the description, or visit brilliant.org/nutshell to sign up for freeand learn more things than there are fish in the sea.And there's an extra perk for Kurzgesagt viewers. The first 688 people to use the linkget 20% off their annual membership, which lets you view all the daily problems in the archives,and unlock every course.Brilliant helps you end your day a little smarter. Go ahead and take the plunge.Do you need more vitamin C? We've also made an epic poster featuring some of the most fascinating creatureswe encountered on our dive.It's much less work than an aquarium, but just as soothing and pretty.[\u266b Outro Tune \u266b]{Check out the Kurzgesagt Merch Shop!}",

   "transcription": "what if our universe comes with aself-destruct button we to eliminateitself so cleanly and efficiently thatevery single physical thing would juststop existing and life would beimpossible foreverthe ultimate ecological catastrophevacuum decay to explain how our universecould destroy itself we need tounderstand two principles one energylevels a core idea in physics is thateverything has an energy level thehigher the level the more energy is inthe system wood for example has a highlevel it can be burned a process thatreleases the chemical energy stored inits molecular bonds and turns it intoheat the ash leftover is at a lowerenergy level than the wood before tostability everything in our universetries to move towards its ground statein which it's completely stable and hasas little energy as possible for examplea ball on the hill is unstable and has alot of potential energy when disturbs itwill roll down into the valley and loseits potential energy in the process theball is now in its ground state andstable it will remain like thateverything in our universe follows thesetwo principles if something has a lot ofenergy its unstable and was to get ridof it to become stable and reach itsground statethis is true for every system even inthe weird world of quantum mechanics ifour current understanding of physics iscorrect then the universe gets itsproperties from quantum fields weexplain them in detail in another videofor this videoimagine them as the rules of theuniverse they tell particles how tobehave and interacts like everything inthe universe they want to be in thelowest energy level possible which iscalled a vacuum state this has nothingto do with vacuum in space it's justcalled this way because scientists arebad at naming things we think all thefields reached their vacuum state exceptmaybe one it's possible that the Higgsfield is not stable but metastable whichis a fancy way of saying that itpretends to be stable but rarely is notit would be a full vacuum the Higgsfield is responsible for givingparticles their mass which rules howalmost everything in the universeinteracts what would happen if the Higgsfield is in a false vacuum think of ourball in the valley the ball is the Higgsfield the valley might not be the lowestenergy state for the Higgs field theremight be an even deeper valley that itwants to get to this would mean that theHiggs field has a lot of potentialenergy waiting to be released the Higgsfield could be like a piece of wood butdrenched in gasoline waiting to set theuniverse on fire a random spark likequantum tunneling could release thepotential energy of the Higgs field thiscould happen at any time and withoutwarning if at any point in space this socalled a vacuum decay starts there is noturning back as the Higgs field crashesinto the lower energy state it releasesa massive amount of potential energythis energy pushes the space around itover the barrier which releases morepotential energya sphere of the new stable Hicks fieldor true vacuum grows at the speed oflight in all directions imagine it likesetting a sea of gasoline the size ofthe universe on firethe sphere is surrounded by a shun ofenergy that devours everything it comesinto contact with whatever it touches iseliminated from existence the bubblewill continue to grow forever deletingthe universe on its way there is no wayto be warned since it's so fast butthere's nothing we could do anywaynow destruction would be instant in afraction of a second earth would be gonebut it actually gets worse if the energylevel of the higgs field changes itchanges all of physics in the truevacuum of the sphere the standard modelwill be overthrown superseded bydifferent physics that we don't know howfundamental particles behave how atomshold together how chemicals react vacuumdecay won't just destroy life it willdestroy chemistry itself making life aswe know is impossible we simply have noidea what it would be like in size itmight be a shadow of what it is now ornot we don't know if vacuum decayhappens the outlook is indeed grim ifyou feel slightly worried now don't beat this point false vacuum isspeculation based on our currentunderstanding of particle physics whichmight be wrongit's kind of like using a ruler tomeasure a continent so you can do it butyou might be off by quite a bit at theend right nowno one can say a vacuum decay is a thingthat's real or just a scary idea buteven if one or multiple spheres of deathhave already started expanding theuniverse is so big that they might notreach us for billions of years ifthey're far enough away they might notever be able to reach us because of theexpansion of the universe the speed oflight is not that fast on the scale ofthe universeso while vacuum decay is

humanity'slast home right before the death of theuniverse what are these strange thingsand what happens when they finally die[Music]how long stars live varies drasticallydepending on how massive they are forexample really massive stars burn hotand fast dying violently in supernovae afew million years after birth butthey're the exception 97% of all starswill end their existence as white dwarfsthere are two ways this can happen smallstars so-called red dwarfs burn out overtrillions of years until they eventuallyquietly turn into white dwarfsmedium-sized stars like our Sun are moreinteresting imagine the Sun as a hugepressure cooker that fuses hydrogen intohelium in its core through its gravitythe fusion of elements releases extremeamounts of energy that pushes outwardsand stabilizes the star keeping it in adelicate balance when the Sun is old thehydrogen in the core is exhausted andthe Sun will begin to burn helium intoheavier elements while doing so it willshed its outer layers when this processis over more than half of the sun's masswill be lost into space as a spectacularplanetary nebula millions of kilometersacross what remains will be its formercorea white dwarf is born a star corpsewhile its former self was about 100times its diameter now it's only aboutas big as Earth but still with abouthalf of its former mass this means it'sextremely dense a teaspoon of whitedwarf is about as massive as a car itssurface gravity is over 100 thousandtimes higher than Earth if you tried toland on it you'd immediately becompressed into a steaming puddle lifearound a white dwarf is very unlikelybut possible most of them that exist nowwere former stars that well died whichprobably ruined any planets they oncehad but that's not all since they are sosmall the planet would need to orbitthem about 75 times closer than Earth isto the Sun to have liquid water thisproximity has up-and-down sides for oneit would tightly lock the planet givingit a permanent day and permanent night[Music]and the edges of these day and nightzones life could be possible but whitedwarfs have a very stable energy outputso they might actually be safer to livearound than many red dwarfs this isstill speculation at this point but ifwe could find a white dwarf with theright conditions to settle around wecould have a home for many billions ofyears but why do they shine so muchlonger than other star types whitedwarfs are very very hot up to 40 timeshotter than our Sun ranking among thehottest objects in the universe thatthey are not incredibly active all theheat inside of them is trapped and hasnowhere to go only on its outer layercan it escape into space but space ismostly empty so heat can't betransferred by conduction the only wayenergy can escape is by radiationthis is so inefficient that white dwarfswill take trillions of years to cooldown which may make them humanity's lastrefuge they might be the last sources oflight and energy in a dying universeaccording to some estimates white dwarfsmight shine as long as 100 billionbillion years ten billion times longerthan the universe has existed so farinto the future that no regular starswill shine any more galaxies will

overcrowdedslums in mega cities covering continentsdiseases and pollution chaos andviolence over energywater and food and a human speciesfocused only on sustaining itselfwill population growth destroy our wayof life oris this prophecy just ungrounded panicin the 1960s population growth reachedan unprecedented ratewhich led to apocalyptic propheciesthe poor would procreate endlessly andoverrun the developed worldthe legend of overpopulation was bornbut it turns out high birth rates andthe population explosionare not permanent features of somecultures or countriesbut rather part of a four-step processthe whole world is going throughthe demographic transition mostdeveloped countries have already madethe transitionwhile other countries are doing it rightnowlet's go back to the 18th century whenthe entire world including europewas in the first stage of thedemographic transitionby today's standards europe was worseoff than a developing regionsuffering from poor sanitation poordietsand poor medicine a lot of people werebornbut lots of them died just as fast sothe population hardly grewwomen had between four and six childrenbut only two of them would reachadulthoodthen the industrial revolution happenedin the ukand brought the greatest change in humanliving conditions since the agriculturalrevolutionpeople went from being peasants toworkersmanufactured goods were mass-producedand became widely availablethe sciences flourished and advancedtransportationcommunication and medicine the role ofwomen in society shiftedand created the conditions for theiremancipationslowly this economic progress not onlyformed a middle classbut also raised standards of living andhealthcare for the poor workingpopulationthe second transition stage startedbetter food supplies hygiene andmedicine meant people stopped dying allthe timeespecially so at a very young age theresult was a population explosiondoubling the uk's population between1750 and 1850the main reason families used to havelots of children was that only a few ofthem were likely to survivenow that had changed so the third stageof the transition was set in motionfewer babies were conceived andpopulation growth slowed downeventually a balance emerged fewerpeople were dyingand fewer children were born so thedeath rate and birth rate became stablebritain had reached the fourth stage ofthe demographic transitionthis didn't only happen in the uk moreand more countries went through the fourstagesfirst many births and many deaths due tobad living conditionssecond better living conditions leadingto fewer deaths and a populationexplosionthird fewer deaths resulting in fewerbirthsand population growth came to an end butif birth rates have dropped so much whyis the population still growing so fastwell the children born in the populationexplosion of the 70s and 80sare having kids themselves now leadingto a noticeable spike inoverall population but they are havingfar fewer children on average than theirparentsthe average today is 2.5 it was 540 years ago so as this generation getsolderand fertility declines further the rateof population growth will keep onslowingthis is true for every country in thewest we tend to overlook progress inother regions of the worldbut actually most of the world'scountries have made it to the fourthstagejust look at bangladesh in 1971 theaverage woman had seven kidsbut 25 percent of them would die beforethe age of fivein 2015 the mortality rate was down to3.8 percentand women had only 2.2 kids on averagethis is the rule not an exception we'renot specialwe just had a head start it tookdeveloped countries about 80 years toreduce fertility from more than sixchildrento less than three others are catchingup fastmalaysia and south africa did it in only34 yearsbangladesh took just 20. iran managed itin 10 yearsall these countries that are catching updidn't have to start from scratchand the more support they get the fasterthey catch upthis is why programs that help lowerchild mortality or help poor nationsdevelopare so important no matter what yourmotivation iswhether you dream of a world where allpeople live in freedom and wealthor you just want fewer refugees comingto your country the simple truth is thatit's beneficial to you personally ifpeople on the other side of the globecan live a good life and we are gettingtherethe percentage of people living inextreme poverty has never been as lowas today so the future of globalpopulation growth is actually notan apocalyptic prophecy at all it's apromisepopulation growth will come to an endthe un forecasts that the 12 billionthhumanwill never be born at all andas the development level of the worldrises the number of people with a

   "title": "Neutron Stars \u2013 The Most Extreme Things that are not Black Holes",
   "publishedAt": "10 Nov 2019",
   "transcription": "Neutron Stars are one of the most extreme andviolent things in the Universe.Giant atomic nuclei,only a few kilometres in diameter,but as massive as stars. And they owe their existence tothe death of something majestic[Kurzgesagt intro]Stars exist because of a fragile balance.The mass of millions of billions of trillionsof tons of hot plasma are being pulled inwards byGravity and squeeze material together with so much forcethat nuclei fuse.Hydrogen fuses into Helium.This releases energy which pushes against gravity and tries to escapeAs long as this balance exists,stars are pretty stableEventually, the hydrogens will be exhaustedMedium stars like our Sun go to a Giant phasewhere they burn Helium into Carbon and Oxygenbefore they eventually turned into White Dwarfs.But in stars many times the mass of our Sun,things get interesting when the Helium is exhausted.For a moment, the balance of pressure and radiation tipsand the gravity wins - squeezing the star tighter than beforeThe core burns hotter and faster while the outer layersof the star swell by a hundreds of times,fusing heavier and heavier elements.Carbon burns to Neons for centuries,Neon to Oxygen in a year, Oxygen to Silicone in monthsand Silicone to Iron in a dayAnd then, death.Iron is nuclear ash. It has no energy to giveand cannot be fusedThe fusion suddenly stops, and the balance ends.Without the outward pressure from fusion, the core is crushedby the enormous weight of the star above itWhat happens now is awesome and scaryParticles like electrons and protonsreally don't want to be near each otherbut the pressure of the collapsing star is so greatthat electrons and protons fused into neutronswhich then get squeezed together as tightly as atomic nucleiAn iron ball the size of Earth is squeezed intoa ball of pure nuclear matter the size of a cityBut not just the core, the whole star implodesGravity pulling the outer layers inat 25% the speed of lightThis implosion bounces off the Iron coreproducing a shockwave that explodes outwardscatapults the rest of the star into space.This is what we called a Supernova explosionand it will outshine entire galaxyWhat remains of the star, is now a Neutron starIts mass is around a million times the mass of the Earthbut compressed to an object about 25 kilometres wideIt's so dense that the mass of all living humanswould fit into 1 cubic centimetre of Neutron star matterThat's roughly a billion tonnesin a space a size of a sugar cube.Put another way, that's Mount Everestin a cup of coffeeFrom the outside, a Neutron star is unbelievably extremeIts gravity is the strongest outside Black Holes,and if it were any denser, it would become oneLight is bent around it - meaning you can see the frontand parts of the backTheir surfaces reach a million degree Celciuscompared to a measly 6,000 degrees for our SunOkay, let's look inside a Neutron starAlthough these giant atomic nuclei are stars,In many ways, they're also like planetswith solid crust over liquid coreThe crust is extremely hardThe outermost layers are made of Iron leftover from the Supernovasqueezed together in a crystal latticewith a sea of electrons flowing through themGoing deeper gravity squeezes nucleicloser togetherWe find fewer and fewer protons as most merged to neutrons.Until we reach the base of the crustHere, nuclei are squeezed together so hard that they start to touch.Protons and neutrons rearrangedmaking long cylinders or sheetsEnormous nuclei with millions of protons and neutronsshaped like spaghetti and lasagne, which physicist called Nuclear PastaNuclear Pasta is so dense,that it maybe the strongest material in the Universe - basically unbreakableLumps of pasta inside a Neutron star can even make mountainsat most a few centimetres highbut many times as massive as the HimalayasEventually, beneath the pasta, we reach the coreWe're not really sure what the properties of matter arewhen they're squeezed this hardProtons and neutrons might dissolve into an ocean of quarksa so called quark-gluon plasmaSome of those quarks might turn into Strange quarksmaking a sort of Strange matter, with propertiesso extreme that we made a whole video about itOr maybe they just stay protons and neutronsNo one knows for sure and that's why we do Science.That's all pretty heavy stuff, literallyso let's go back out into SpaceWhen neutron stars first collapse, they begin to spin very very fastlike a ballerina pulling her arms inNeutron stars are cellestial ballerinasspinning many times per second.This creates pulses because their magnetic field creates a beam ofradio waves, which passes every time they spinThese radio pulsars are the best known type of Neutron starabout 2,000 are known of in the Milky WayThese magnetic fields are the strongest in the Universea quadrillion times stronger than Earth after they're bornThey're called Magnetars until they calm down a bitBut the absolute best kind of neutron starsare friends with other neutron starsBy radiating away energy as gravitational wavesripples in space-time, their orbits can decayand they can crush into and kill each otherin a Killnova explosion that spews out a lot of their guts.When they do, the conditions become so extremethat for a moment, heavy nuclei are made againIt's not fusion putting nuclei together this time,but heavy neutron-rich matter falling apartand reassemblingOnly very recently, we've learnt that this is probablythe origin of most of the heavy elements in the Universelike Gold, Uranium, and Platinum and dozens moreSo then our two neutron stars collapsed and become a black holedying yet againNot only does stars have to die to create elements,they have to die twice.Over millions of years, these atomswill mix back into the Galaxy, but some of them end up in cloudwhich gravity pulls together to form stars and planetsrepeating the cycleOur Solar System is one example, and the remains of thoseneutron stars that came before usare all around usOur entire technological modern world was builtout of the elements neutron stars made in eons passedsending these atoms on 13-billion-year journeyto come together and make us and our worldAnd that's pretty coolUntil then, we can look them on paperThe 12,020 year human space era calendarhas arrivedYou could order it now until we sell out, and then never againVisit the cloudy cities of VenusDyson's swarm assembly on Mercuryand cross the borders of our Solar systemShipping from the U.S. and from Europe the first timeBut we deliver to every country all over the worldYou can also get a plushee or hoodie or posterWe have some sweet deals for youGet it for Christmas for your friends, families and kidsor to distract yourself from the fact there are100 billion billion Earth-like planets in habital zone ofSun-like stars in the obsrevable Universeand you will never visit any of themThe last few years we sold them all, so no rushbut the clock is tickingGetting stuff from our shop is on eof the best waysto support Kurzgesagt.

   "title": "The Last Star in the Universe \u2013 Red Dwarfs Explained",
   "publishedAt": "31 Jan 2016",
   "transcription": "one day the last star will die and theuniverse will turn dark forever it willprobably be a red dwarf a tiny kind ofstar that's also one of our best bets tofind alien life and might be the lasthome of humanity before the universebecomes uninhabitable so what do we knowabout them and why are they our lasthope at least 70% of stars in theuniverse are red dwarfs they are thetanja stars out there with only about 7to 50% of the mass of our Sun not thatmuch bigger than our planet Jupiterwhich is still huge though they are alsovery dim it's impossible to see themwith the naked eye you've never seen onein the night sky even with all ourtechnology we can only clearly observered dwarfs in our neighborhoodapproximately 20 of the 30 stars closeto Earth are red dwarfs like all starsred dwarfs fuse hydrogen into helium butwhile more massive stars accumulate allthe fuse helium in their cores reddwarfs stay convective meaning that thehelium and hydrogen constantly makes sothey use up their fuel incredibly slowlybefore they're extinguished red dwarfsburn so slowly that that averagelifespan is between 1 and 10 trillionyears by comparison the Sun will survivefor another five billion years becausethe universe is only thirteen pointseven five billion years old not asingle red dwarf has reached laterdevelopment stages every single one ofthe trillions that exists is still ababy speaking of babies the smalleststar in the entire universe is also ared dwarf because small red dwarfs areright on the verge of being a star atall just a tiny bit less hydrogen andthey are mere brown dwarfs failed starsthat cannot sustain a fusion reactionforso what about aliens or a new home forhumanity since our son will die one daywe'll eventually need to look for a newhome and where there are habitableplanets there might also be aliens theKepler space observatory found that atleast half of all red dwarfs host rockplanets between half and four times themass of our earth many of them are inthe habitable zone the area around astar where water can be liquid but sincered dwarfs burn at relatively coldtemperatures a planet would need to bereally close to be hospitable probablyas close as mercury to our Sun or evencloser which brings with it all kinds ofproblems for example a planet this closeto a star would probably be tightlylockedmeaning the same side would always faceit this side would be incredibly hotwhile the shadow side would be frozenwhich makes it hard for life to developalthough a planet with a big enoughocean might be able to distribute thestar's energy and create some kind ofstability all the gravitational forcesof the red dwarf could squeeze theplanets and heat it up so much but itmight lose all its water over time theseplanets could end up like Venus a hotburning hell another problem is thatmany red dwarfs vary in their energyoutput they can be covered in star spotsthat condemn their emitted light by upto 40% for months which would causeoceans on planets to freeze over atother times they can emit powerful solarflares sudden outbursts of energyincredibly powerful these red dwarfscould double their brightness in minuteswhich could strip away sizable portionsof a planet's atmosphere and burn itrendering its sterile on the other handtheir extremely long lifespan is a bigplus a red dwarf with just moderatelevels of activity could be an amazingplace for a planet for the hosts lifelife on Earth has existed for about fourbillion years and we have about abillion years left before the Sunbecomes so hot the complex life on Earthwill become impossible we will eitherdie out or leave earth and look for anew home we could build a civilizationfor potentially trillions of yearsaround a red dwarf with the rightconditions about 5% of the red dwarfs inthe Milky Way may host habitable roughlyearth sized planets that would be morethan four billion in total but life maynot even need a planet like Earthcandidates for life around a red dwarfmaybe the moons of gas giants alsocalled super Earths rady massive rockyplanets although there are an estimated60 billion potentially habitable planetsaround red dwarfs and that's in theMilky Way alone so red dwarfs mightbecome really important for our survivalin the future but everything has to dieat some point even red dwarfs when intrillions of years the life of the lastred dwarf in the universe is about toend it will not be a very spectacularevent as its hydrogen runs out itshrinks becoming a blue dwarf burningout completely after its fuel is spentit's transformed into a white dwarf anobject about as small as Earth packedvery densely and made of degenerategases mostly of helium-4 nuclei havingno more source of energy it will coolextremely slowly over trillions of yearsuntil it becomes its final form a coldblack dwarf white and black dwarfs areso fascinating that they deserve theirown video anyway it's going to be a longtime before the last stars in theuniverse vanish it's

   "title": "The Side Effects of Vaccines - How High is the Risk?",
   "publishedAt": "12 May 2019",
   "transcription": "vaccines are celebrated for their partin fighting disease but a growing groupof people seem to believe that theyendanger our health instead ofprotecting it the internet is full ofstories about allergic reactions theonset of disabilities and even deathfollowing vaccination appointments andit's true vaccines can have side effectslet's look at how they work and howdangerous they really are your immunesystem is a complex army of billions ofcells soldiers intelligent cells andweapons factories every day you'reattacked countless times but you'reimmune soldiers alone usually deal withthat so you don't even notice if aninfection become serious thoughour intelligence cells gather Intelabout the attackers and activate ourweapons factories you know the weaponantibodies they're like targetedmissiles produced specifically to combatthe invader unfortunately this processtakes several days to complete thatgives intruders a lot of time to dodamage contrary to popular wisdom whatdoesn't kill you doesn't make youstronger our bodies really don't want tofight serious wars are over and over soour immune system came up with aningenious way to get stronger andstronger over time if we fight an enemythat is dangerous enough to trigger ourheavy weapons our immune systemautomatically creates memory cellsmemory cells remain in our body foryears in a deep sleep they do nothingbut remember when an enemy attacks for asecond time the slumbering memory cellsawaken and order coordinated attacks andthe production of antibodies this is sofast and effective that many infectionsyou beat once will never make you sickagain you might even be immune againstthem forever which is also why littlekids aren't constantly illthey don't have enough memory cells yetand this beautiful natural mechanism iswhat we build on when we use vaccineshow vaccines work as greatest memorycells are obtaining them through aninfection is unpleasant and sometimesdangerous vaccines are a way of trickingour bodies into making memory cells andbecoming immune to a disease theypretend to be a dangerous infection oneway of doing this is to inject invadersthat can't do harm for example bykilling them or by ripping them intopieces our immune systems deal withthese kinds of vaccines pretty easilysometimes it's necessary to make ourimmune system work harder though toproduce even more memory cells livevaccines are the real deal an enemy thatcan punch back is a bigger challengethan a dead onebut this also sounds like a sort ofhorrible idea what if the germs win toavoid that we read a sort of weak cousinof the real germ in the lab justpowerful enough to annoy the immunesystem and create enough memory cellsokay so these are the basic principlesof vaccine use they provoke a naturalreaction in our bodies that makes usbecome immune against very dangerousdiseases some like the flu virus mutatesso often that we need a new vaccineevery year but most vaccines protect usfor years or even a lifetime but there'sa catch like everything in life vaccineshave another side side effects what arethey and what happens if your childdevelops one the risks of vaccines it'scomplicated to directly compare the sideeffects of vaccines with the effects ofdiseases for example hundreds ofmillions of people are vaccinatedagainst measles in the West but therewere only 83,000 cases in Europe in 2018so with numbers that different even mildside effects can seem scary comparedto the bad effects of a disease that wedon't see as much anymorebefore the measles vaccine becameavailable in 1963 virtually every singlechild on earth contracted measles atsome point an estimated 135 millioncases in the 1950s every single year butour measles really that dangerous in theyear 2019 with our advanced health careand new technologies are they worth therisk of vaccine side-effects let's do athought experiment based on real numbersimagine a developed country in aparallel worldit has good healthcare but people stopvaccinating in this scenario let's sayten million children caught measles whathappens nine million eight hundredthousand or 98% will get a high feverand a very unpleasant rash up to 800,000of them or 8% will suffer from dangerousdiarrhea 700,000 or 7% will suffer froman ear infection which can lead topermanent hearing loss 600,000 kids or6% will suffer from pneumonia the mostdangerous effect of measles it alonewill kill 12,000 children up to 10,000children or 0.1% will get encephalitis2500 kids or 0.025 percent will contractsspe a disease where the measles viruslingers in their brain and kills them afew years later taken together around2.5 million children will suffer fromsomewhat serious effects from measlesand about 20,000 children will be killedby measles it doesn't stop here thoughthe kids who beat measles are left witha severely damaged immune system thatneeds a lot of time to regenerate timefor other diseases to do further damageaside from that what's almost guaranteedis that your kids will have a really badtime for about two weeks okay but whatabout vaccines it's only fair to look atthese risks too so let's repeat ourthought experiment but this time wevaccinate ten million children with MMRwhat would theoretically happen hereafter being vaccinated about 10 millionkids around ten percent get a feverfive hundred thousand or five percentwill get a mild rash up to one hundredor 0.001 percent might have a seriousallergic reaction and will have to betreated up to ten boys or 0.0001% mightget inflammation of the genitalia and upto ten kids in total or 0.0001 percentmight get the most serious side effectand sefa lightest so we vaccinated tenmillion kids in total around one hundredand twenty had side effects that weresomewhat serious thanks to good medicaltreatment in developed regions almostall of them will be finewhat about autism the connection ofautism and vaccines stems from onesource that has been disproven acountless times will link to furtherreading and videos in the descriptionbut in 2019 it's fair to say thatvaccines do not cause autism all rightbut what about deaths it's really hardto say if even a single one of our 10million vaccinated kids would die wereally did look hard and talk to a lotof different expertsif we ignore self-reporting we couldonly come up with a tiny handful ofdocumented cases for all the hundreds ofmillions of children who received theMMR vaccine since 1971 measles are manymany thousands of times more dangerousfor your child than even the absoluteworst case of vaccine side-effectsyou have to search for lethal vaccinesside-effects with a huge magnifyingglass and even then it's very hard tofind confirmed cases while deaths frommeasles are real and easy to find in2017 alone110,000 people died from measlesworldwide statistically today 300children will die of measles one sincethis video started you can comparevaccines to seatbelts are there weirdfreak accidents where someone getskilled by their seatbelt well yesbut do you personally think it's saferto not put a seatbelt on your kid wait asecond what if your kid is actuallyallergic what if none of the thingswe've said applies to your specificsituation in this case you need tobecome the greatest vaccination promoterof all because if your children can't bevaccinated only the collective canprotect them this is called herdimmunity and it's the only thing thatcan protect your unvaccinated child herdimmunity means that enough people areimmune to a disease that it can't spreadand dies before it reaches its victimsbut to accomplish this for measles alone95% of the people around you need to bevaccinated conclusion the problem withthe debate about vaccines is that it'snot fought on a level playing fieldwhile the pro vaccine side argues withstudies and statistics the argumentsagainst them are usually a wild mixtureof gut feeling anecdotes andmisinformation and feelings are oftenimmune to facts will not convinceanybody by screaming at them but wecan't hide from the reality of what antivaccine conspiracies do they kill babiestoo young to be vaccinated they killhealthy children that are just unluckythey bring serious diseases back fromthe verge of extinction and the biggestside effect of vaccines is fewer deadchildren vaccines are one of the mostpowerful tools we have to eradicate themonsters that most of us have alreadyforgottenlet's not bring the beasts back[Music]youyouyou",

   "publishedAt": "08 Jun 2017",
   "transcription": "how long do you think it will takebefore machines do your job better thanyou do automation used to mean bigstupid machines doing repetitive work infactories today they can lab aircraftdiagnose cancer and trade stocks we areentering a new age of automation unlikeanything that's come before according toa 2013 study almost half of all jobs inthe US could potentially be automated inthe next two decades but wait hasn'tautomation been around for decadeswhat's different this time the thingsthat used to be simple innovation madehuman work easier and productivity rosewhich means that more staff or servicescan be produced per hour using the sameamount of human workers this eliminatedmany jobs it also created other jobsthat were better which was importantbecause the growing population neededwork so in a nutshell innovation higherproductivity fewer old jobs and many newand often better jobs overall thisworked well for a majority of people andliving standards improved there's aclear progression in terms of whathumans did for a living for the longesttime we worked in agriculture with theIndustrial Revolution this shift intoproduction jobs and as automation becamemore widespread humans shifted intoservice jobs and then only a few momentsago in human history the Information Agehappened suddenly the rules weredifferent our jobs are now being takenover by machines much faster than theywere in the pastthat's wiring of course but innovationwill clearly save us right while newinformation age industries are boomingthey are creating fewer and fewer newjobs in 1979 General Motors employedmore than 800,000 workers and made about11 billion u.s. dollars in 2012 Googlemade about 14 billion u.s. dollars whileemploying 58,000 people you may not likethis comparison but Google is an exampleof what created new jobs in the pastinnovative new industries old innovativeindustries are running out of steam justlook at cars when they became a thing100 years ago they created hugeindustries cars transformed our way oflife our infrastructure and our citiesmillions of people found jobs eitherdirectly or indirectly decades ofinvestment kept this momentum goingtoday this process is largely completeinnovation in the car industry does notcreate as many jobs as in Houston whileelectric cars are great and all theywon't create millions of new jobs butwait what about the internet sometechnologists argue that the Internet isan innovation on a power of theintroduction of electricity if we gowith this comparison we see how ourmodern innovation differs from the oldone the internet created new industriesbut they're not creating enough jobs tokeep up with population growth or tocompensate for the industries theinternet is killing at its peak in 2004blockbuster had 84,000 employees andmade 6 billion US dollars in revenue in2016 Netflix had 4,500 employees andmade 9 billion dollars in revenue fortake us for example with a full-timeteam of just 12 people courtesan 2reaches millions of people a TV stationwith the same amount of viewers needsway more employees innovation in theinformation age doesn't equate to thecreation of enough new jobs which wouldbe bad enough on its own but now a newwave of automation and a new generationof machines is slowly taking over tounderstand this we need to understandourselves first human progress is basedon the division of labor as we advancedover thousands of years our jobs becamemore and more specialized while even oursmartest machines are bad at doingcomplicated jobs they are extremely goodat doing now redefined and predictabletasks this is what destroyed factoryjobs but look at a complex job long andhard enough and you'll find that it'sready just many narrowly defined andpredictable tasks one after anothermachines are on the brink of becoming sogood at breaking down complex jobs intomany predictable ones but for a lot ofpeople there will be no further room tospecialize we on the verge of being outcompleted digital machines do this flymachine learning which enables them toacquire information and skills byanalyzing data this makes them becomebetter at something through therelationships they discover machinesteach themselves we make this possibleby giving a computer a lot of data aboutthe thing we wanted to become better atso a machine all the things you boughtonline and it will slowly learn what torecommend to you so you buy more thingsmachine learning is now meeting more ofits potential because in recent yearshumans have started to gather data abouteverythingbehavior weather patterns medicalrecords communication systems traveldata and of course data about what we doat work what we've created by accidentis a huge library machines can use tolearn how humans do things and learn todo them better these digital machinesmight be the biggest job killer of allthey can be replicated instantly and forfree when they improve you don't need toinvest in big metal things you can justuse the new code and they have theability to get better fast how fast ifyour work involves complex work on acomputer today you might be out of workeven sooner than the people who stillhave jobs in factories there are actualreal-world examples of how thistransition might be happening a SanFrancisco company offers a projectmanagement software for big corporationswhich is supposed to eliminate middlemanagement positions when it's hired fora new projectthe software first decides which jobscan be automated and precisely where itneeds actual professional humans it thenhelps assemble a team of freelancersover the Internet the software thendistributes tasks to the humans andcontrols the quality of the worktracking individual performance untilthe project is complete ok this doesn'tsound too badwhile this machine is killing one job itcreates jobs for freelancers right wellas the freelancers complete their taskslearning algorithms track them andgather data about their work and whichtasks it consists of so what's actuallyhappening is that the freelancers areteaching a machine how to replace themon average this software reduces costsby about 50% in the first year and byanother 25% in the second year this isonly one example of many there aremachines and programs getting as good orbetter than humans in all kinds offields from pharmacists to analystsjournalists to radiologists cashiersbank tellers or the unskilled workerflippingall of these jobs won't disappearovernight but fewer and fewer humanswill be doing we'll discuss a few casesin a follow-up video but while jobsdisappearing it's bad it's only half ofthe story it's not enough to substituteold jobs with new ones we need to begenerating new jobs constantly becausethe world population is growing in thepast we have solved this throughinnovation but since 1973 the generationof new jobs in the US has begun toshrink and the first decade of the 21stcentury was the first one where thetotal amount of jobs in the u.s. did notgrow for the first time in a countrythat needs to create up to 150,000 newjobs per month just to keep up withpopulation growth this is bad news thisis also starting to affect standards ofliving in the past it was seen asobvious that with rising productivitymore and better jobs would be createdbut the numbers tell a different storyin 1998 US workers worked a total of 194billion hours over the course of thenext 15 years their output increased by42 percent but in 2013 the amount ofhours worked by US workers was still 194billion hours what this means is thatdespite productivity growing drasticallythousands of new businesses opening upand the u.s. population growing by over40 million there was no growth at allwhen the number of hours worked in 15years at the same time wages for newuniversity graduates in the US have beendeclining for the past decade one up to40 percent of new graduates are forcedto take on jobs that don't require adegreeproductivity is separating from humanneighbor the nature of innovation andthe information age is different fromeverything we encountered before thisprocess started years ago and is alreadywell underwayeven without new disruptions likeself-driving cars or robot accountantsit looks like automation is differentthis time this time the machines mightreally take our jobs our economies arebased on the premise that people consumebut if fewer and fewer people havedecent work who will be doing all theconsuming are we producing ever morecheaply only to arrive at a point wheretoo few people can actually buy all ourstuff and services all will the futuresee a tiny minority of the Civic who ownthe machines dominating the rest of usand does our future-ready have to bethat

heading so the next step on theladder of consciousness is to add someperception at a distance like visionvision adds context and depth to ourworld with vision comes a sense of thespace we and our food exist in it adds awhole new dimension to awareness and isa huge step towards more familiarconsciousness an optical apparatus likean eye enables us to visualize our goaland lock on to it but even at this stagea self is only able to pursue its foodas long as it sees it so the nextlogical step needs to happen on theinside to visualize food in its absencefor example a self needs to create somesort of inner representation of theworldnow an animal can continue looking forfood even when it escapes its sensoryrange because of this innerrepresentation of what is relevant inthe world it can remain focused on itsfood and its desire to get it our selfnow exists in a world it can getfamiliar with the ability to rememberthings has emergedthanks to memory animals can bedistracted from a pursuit for a fewseconds but quickly continue their pathafterwards a related phenomenon iscalled object permanence this describesour awareness that things continue toexist even when we can't see them thiscognitive skill is enjoyed by somemammals and birds than perhaps otheranimals too human babies tend to developthis ability around the time they turneight months while baby chickens showthis ability within a day or two ofbeing born the capacity to remember athing in its absence suggests at least abasic sense of time a sense of time is abig step on the ladder of consciousnessit may also enable itself to lookforward from the present moment andanticipate the future adult chickens forexample are able to resist a meal put infront of them if they expect to receivea bigger meal as a prize for holdingback for a while this sort of delayedgratification means there is an abilityto visualize a reward that only existsin the future which can be quite achallenge even for adult humans Westernscrub jays are experts in delayedgratification they shown even moreelaborate sense of the future when theyhide food in a cache to retrieve it at alater date the scrub jays will evenrehydrateif they become aware that a potentialthief has been watching them this meansthat they know that there are otherhungry selves out there who are awareand see the world from their owndifferent perspectivecrafty scrub jays can sort of read themind of their fellow birds this abilityto mind-read is crucial for complexlevels of consciousness by puttingyourself in the position of others youcan outsmart a rich competitor orempathize with a hungry friend languagetakes the ability to read minds andrepresent what is absent to a whole newlevel words enable us to constructhypotheses about the world make detailedplans and to communicate them withothers words enable us to think aboutourselves and our place in the universeand even about our own consciousnesswhich is something we'll be doing morein future videos so what is the originof our consciousness it probably beganas the directed motion of a hungry selftowards a source of food with thesurvival benefits this gave it overcompetitors that moved at random or notat all it probably all started with theurge for more food so even with thesophisticated consciousness that allowsus to dream about space buildskyscrapers or obsess about novels it'snot surprising that we can't stopthinking about where we'll get our nextmeal collectively we've put so muchthought and ingenuity into getting foodthat we can now just get our food tocome to

thatcollected in a giant dirty gas cloud thegas cloud became denser in its centerand formed the chr\u00e9tien disk smallparticles started clumping together andbuilding larger and larger objects untilthey formed the objects we call planetstoday this process took 10 to 20 millionyears and is still not very wellunderstood at about this time when thesolar system was young and chaotic agiant object about as big as Marscollided with our homethe impact was violent and if the objecthad been more massive it might havedestroyed earth material from earth wassmashed out into orbit and formed themoon which is the biggest satellite inrelation to its planet in the solarsystemat this time Earth was a hot hellconstantly being hit by asteroids withseas of lava and a toxic atmosphere butsomething was about to changedrastically earth cooled down water fromthe inside of the earth wandered to thesurface and rained down on earth only tovaporize again and become cloudsmillions of asteroids brought more andmore water to our planet all the wateron earth has about this volume comparedto earth today the surface of earth is71% water and 29% land 97.5% is say 9water while only 2.5 percent is freshwater the fresh water is 69 percent iceand snow 30 percent our ground watersand only about 1% make up the remainingground waters but even this small partis mostly frozen only a tiny part of ourwater is actually lakes and rivers andan even tinier part is bound in livingthings so gradually the earth cooleddown and the surface formed a thin crustbut inside the earth hot rock continueto swirl about moving the crust frombelow and breaking it apart this processis called plate tectonics and ishappening right now we'll make a wholevideo about it in the future for nowlet's just say that the crust of Earthconsists of separate giant plates thatmove around as they meet they crumbleand create mighty mountains or violentplunge back down deeper into earthcreating deep trenches that's the waythe highest place on earth was formedMount Everest and the deepest themariana trench from our perspectiveEarth's mountains and trenches aremighty indeed but when you look at theearth in cross-section you can see howtiny they actually are the part we standon is the crust which is about 50kilometers thick though it can varybetween 5 and 70 kilometers by the waythe deepest hole ever drilled by man is12 point two six two kilometers deepafter the crust comes the mantle it's asilicon rocky shell and about 2900kilometers thick the mantle consists ofthe upper mantle and the lower mantlethe upper mantle has different regionsto its upper part which is viscous andcarries the crust is called thelithosphere after that there comes theasthenosphere which consists of lessmobile mostly solid material the lowermantle reaches deep down to the outercore of Earth Earth's outer core is aliquid layer of iron and nickel about2266 kilometers thick temperatures varyfrom 4,000 degrees Celsius to 5700degrees Celsius and in the center is theinner core it's mostly solid the ballmade of an iron nickel alloy with aradius of about 1,200 kilometers 70% thesize of the moon and about thetemperature

   "title": "The Billion Ant Mega Colony and the Biggest War on Earth",
   "publishedAt": "29 Sep 2019",
   "transcription": "In nearly every corner of the Earth, ants wage war against each other.Their weapons are what nature gave them.Some have strong armor, deadly stingers, or sharp mandibles.And then there's this tiny, not very impressive antbut it rules the biggest empire any ant has ever built.A colony spanning continents and fighting warsthat leave millions of casualties.Let's take a look at this unlikely warrioressLinepithema humile, the Argentine ant.This story begins in the flood plains around theParan\u00e1 River, in South America.It's a crowded ant megalopolis where dozens of ant species fight for dominanceincluding fire ants, army ants and the rather unimpressive Argentine ant.It measures only 2 to 3 millimeters in lengthand with its small mandibles.It's surprising that it survived among its buff competitors.Their homes are equally unremarkable.Their colonies range from fairly small to very largeand could be found anywhere.Under logs, in loose leaf litter or the former colonies of other ants.Here, Argentine ants prepare their most effective weapon against their competitors' bodies.Most ant species have only one queen to produce antswhile Argentine ants went all in on numbers.For 120 workers, there's one queen, laying up to 60 eggs a dayso their economies grow fast, and have millions or billions of individuals.Teams of queens and workers frequently branch out and found new colonies.But their strategy has a downside.As colonies grow and produce a lot of offspringmutations occur and new colonies adapt to new environments.Their DNA slowly changes from generation to generation, and differences accumulateso that after a while the ants that left the colonywill become more like distant cousins, and start to compete with their mother colony.In their native South American range, this is how Argentine antsbehave:Within their colonies, they are very co-operative and well organized.But they fight vicious warsagainst other Argentine ant colonies and other ant species.With equally strong opponents on every sidethe Argentine ant became extremely aggressivefighting for every inch of groundbut it could never dominate its neighbors until humans showed up.We did what humans do and transported things around the world by ship.On one of them a few Argentine ant queens hitched a ride as stowawaysfrom South America to Madeira and New Orleans.The Argentine ants suddenly found themselves in a strange world.Instead of being surrounded by deadly enemiesthey found only victims.Nobody could fight them effectively.Because only a few Argentine ant queens were introduced to the outside worldthe resulting colonies had very low genetic diversity.On top of that, the introduced Argentine antskill up to 90 percent of their queens every yearfewer queens, less genetic variation.So, as these colonies spread across the landscapeants that left the colony were no longer considered distant cousins.As a result, the new colonies form not opposing, but co-operating partiescalled super colonies.This is a very uncommon strategy in the ant kingdom.Only a few of the 16,000 ant specieshave evolved super colonies.A super colony was established on the West Coast of the USAand became a base for the tiny ants' global conquest.Today the Argentine ant inhabits the Mediterranean zones of six continents and many islands.This one super colony was especially successfulestablishing sister locations in CaliforniaEurope, Japan, New Zealand, and Australiaforming one massive intercontinental mega colony of Argentine ants.This makes them the largest society on Earthmore numerous than even the human one.But their success has changed the ecosystems they invaded.California is a perfect example of this.In their greed for more territorythe invading Argentine ants have overrunand replaced 90% of the native ant speciesincluding several species of Californian carpenter ants.Although carpenter ant workers are giantstheir colonies have only between 3,000 and 6,000 individualsand stand no chance against an expanding super colony of billions of Argentine ants.Argentine ant workers attack by wiping toxic chemicals on their victimswhich irritates the enemy and marks them as a target for other Argentine ants.When they attack, the Argentine ants wash over their victimsclinging onto their opponents in groups and pulling apart their limbs.It doesn't matter how many of them die.There are always more.Once the colony is overrun and exterminatedthe Argentine ants feed on their victims' broodand take over their home and territory.The Argentine ants' numbers allow them to hunt down and devoursuch an excessive mass of different insectsthat over time, some species disappear from the ants' territory completely.Argentine ants don't care about working with the local flora and fauna.They consume them and move on.And if their next stop happens to be human propertythey will rudely make themselves at home there too.They forage in dumpsters, bowls of pet foodand sneak into kitchens to claim leftovers.Not just our homes, our gardens and fields are also impacted by Argentine antssince they tend to hordes of aphids as their cattle.The aphids feed from plants and produce a sweet honey dewwhich they trade with the ants for protection.Since the ants have no major enemy to fear in their new homesthe aphids thrive and ultimately kill the plants they live on.So on top of being a major disruption for the ecosystems they invadethey are also a huge pest for agriculture.But the rule of the Argentine ant is being challenged.Parts of the super colonies have broken off and become their own empires.A merciless civil war has broken out.For example, the Lake Hodges super colony has been fightingagainst the very large colony for years in San Diego County.A massive war is going on over a dynamic front line, stretching over kilometers.An estimated 30 million ants die here each year.On other fronts, an old acquaintance from the Paran\u00e1 River has risen from the shadows.Red imported fire ants which were accidentally introduced from their old home to the coast of Alabama.Not only are the red fire ants fierce fighters and more than able to deal with the Argentine antthey are also able to form SuperColonies themselves.Now the old wars from their distant home have been taken to a foreignbattleground.In the southeastern U.S., the Super Colonies clashed fiercely.The Argentine ants found themselves outgunned by the fire ants.The fire ants major workers are more than twice the size as the Argentine antsand wield venom injecting stingers.Even though the Argentine ants fought fiercely, the fire ants were too much for them.After countless lost battles, the red  imported fire ant exterminated the Argentine ants.from much of the southeastern U.S.This is one territory lost, but the Argentine ants will fight on.This amazing network of cooperating super colonies is the biggest success intheir history.And they will not give it up because of a small defeat.They will stand their ground against any enemy that might ariseNo matter if it's on the Paran\u00e1 River, or on one of the large battlefields across the world.These videos were developed with

first gossip speaking ill ofsomebody who's not present not a nicehabit and we know perfectly well theperson gossipingfive minutes later will be gossipingabout ussecond judging we know people who arelike this in conversation and it's veryhard to listen to somebody if you knowthat you're being judged and foundwantingat the same time further negativity youcan fall into this my mother in the lastyear's of her life became very verynegative and it's hard to listen Iremember one day I said to her it'sOctober the 1st today and she said Iknow is did dreadfulit's hard to listen when somebody's thatnegative and another form of negativitycomplaining well this is the nationalart of the UK it's it's our nationalsport we complain about the weatherabout sport about politics abouteverything but actually complaining isviral misery it's not spreading sunshineand lightness in the world excuses we'veall met this guy maybe a we've all beenthis guy some people have a blamethrower they just pass it on toeverybody else and don't takeresponsibility for their actions andagain hard to listen to somebody who'sbeing like thatpenultimate the six of the sevenembroidery exaggeration it demeans ourlanguage actually sometimes for exampleif I see something that really isawesome what do I call it and then ofcourse this exaggeration becomes lyingout and out lying and we don't want tolisten to people we know are lying to usand finally dogmatism the confusion offacts with opinions when those twothings get conflated you're listeninginto the wind you know somebody isbombarding you with their opinions as ifthey were true it's difficult to listento that so here they are seven deadlysins of speaking these are things Ithink we need to avoid but is there apositive way to think about this yesthere is I'd like to suggest that thereare four really powerful cornerstonesfoundations that we can stand on if wewant our speech to be powerful and tomake change in the world fortunatelythese things spell a word the word ishail and it has a great definition aswell I'm not talking about the stuffthat falls from the sky and hits you onthe head I'm talking about thisdefinition to greet or acclaimenthusiastically which is I think howour words will be received if we standon these four things so what do theystand for see if you can guess the Hhonesty of course being true in what yousay being straight and clear the a isauthenticity just being yourself afriend of mine described it as standingin your own truth which i think is alovely way to put itthe i' is integritybeing your word actually doing what yousay and being somebody people can trustand the L is love I don't mean romanticlove but I do mean wishing people wellfor two reasons first of all I thinkabsolute honesty may not be what we wantI mean my goodness you look ugly thismorning and perhaps that's not necessarytempered with love of course honesty isa great thing but also if you're reallywishing somebody well it's very hard tojudge them at the same time I'm not evensure you can do those two thingssimultaneouslyso hail also now that's what you say andit's like the old song it is what yousay it's also the way that you say ityou have an amazing toolbox thisinstrument is incredible and yet this isa toolbox that very few people have everopened I'd like to have a little rummagein there with you now and just pull afew tools out that you might like totake away and play with which willincrease the power of your speakingregister for example now falsettoregister may not be very useful most ofthe time but there's a register inbetween I'm not going to get verytechnical about this for any of you whoare voice coaches you can locate yourvoice however so if I talk up here in mynose you can hear the difference if I godown here and my throat which is wheremost of us speak from most of the timebut if you want weight you need to godown here to the chest you hear thedifference we vote for politicians withlower voices it's true because weassociate depth with power and withauthoritythat's a register and we have Tamborit's the the way your voice feels againthe research shows that we prefer voiceswhich are rich smooth warm like hotchocolate well if that's not you that'snot the end of the world because you cantrain go get a voice coach and there areamazing things you can do with breathingwith posture and with exercises toimprove the timbre of your voice thenpros are the aisle of pros oddly this isthe singsong the meta language that weuse in order to impart meaning it'sroute 1 for meaning in conversationpeople who speak all on one note arereally quite hard to listen to itthey don't have any pros idiot allthat's where the words monotonic comesfrom a monotonous monotone also we haverepetitive prose that he now coming inwhere every sentence ends as if it werea question when it's actually not aquestion it's a statement and if yourepeat that one over and over it'sactually restricting your ability tocommunicate through proceeding which ithink is a shame so let's try and breakthat habit pace I can get very veryexcited by saying something reallyreally quickly or I can slow right downto emphasize and at the end of that ofcourse is our old friend silence it'snothing wrong with a bit of silence in atalk is there we don't have to fill itwith arms and ours can be very powerfulof course pitch often goes along withpace to indicate arousal but you can doit just with pitch where did you leavemy keys where did you leave my keys it'sa slightly different meaning in thosetwo deliveries and finally volume I canget really excited by using volume sorryabout that if I startled anybody or Ican have you really some peoplebroadcast the whole time try not to dothatthat's called sod castingimposing your sound on people around youcarelessly and inconsiderately not niceof course where this all comes into playmost of all is when you've got somethingreally important to do it might bestanding on a stage like this and givinga talk to people it might be proposingmarriage asking for a raise a weddingspeech whatever it is if it's reallyimportant you owe it to yourself to lookat this tool box and the engine thatit's going to work on and no engineworks well without being warmed up warmup your voice actually let me show youhow to do that would you all like tostand up for a moment I'm going to showyou the six vocal warm up exercises thatI do before every talk I ever do anytimeyou're going to talk to anybodyimportant do these first arms up deepbreath in and sigh out her like that onemore time very good now we're going towarm up our lips and we're going to gobah bah bah bah bah very good and nowjust like when you were a kid now yourlips should be coming alive we're goingto do the tongue next with exaggeratedla la la la la la labeautiful you're getting really good atthis and then rolling ourthat's like champagne for the tonguefinally and if I can only do one thepros call this the siren it's reallygoodit starts with wee and goes to all thewee as high the always though here we go[Music]fantastic give yourselves a round ofapplausetake a safe thank you next time youspeak do those in advance now let mejust put this in context to close thisis a serious point here this is where weare now right we speak not very wellinto people who simply aren't listeningin an environment that's all about noiseand bad acoustics I have talked aboutthat on this stage in different phaseswhat would the world be like if we werespeaking powerfully to people who arelistening consciously in environmentswhich were actually fit for purpose orto make that a bit larger what would theworld be like if we were creating soundconsciously and consuming soundconsciously and designing all ourenvironments consciously for sound thatwould be a world that does soundbeautiful and one where understandingwould be the norm and that is an ideaworth spreading thank you[Applause]",

   "title": "Looks aren't everything. Believe me, I'm a model. | Cameron Russell",
   "publishedAt": "16 Jan 2013",
   "transcription": "[Music][Music]hi my name is Cameron Russell and forthe last a little while I've been amodel actually for ten years and I feellike there's an uncomfortable tension inthe room right now because I should nothave worn this dress so luckily Ibrought an outfit change this is thefirst outfit change on the Ted stage soyou guys are pretty lucky to witness itI think if some of the women were reallyhorrified when I came out you don't haveto tell me now but I'll find out lateron Twitter I'd also note that I'm quiteprivileged to be able to transform whatyou think of me in a very brief tenseconds not everybody gets to do thatthese heels are very uncomfortable sogood thing I wasn't going to wear themthe worst part is putting a sweater overmy head because that's when you'll laughat me so don't do anything while it'sover my head all right so why did I dothat that was awkward well hopefully notthis awkward is that picture image ispowerful but also image is superficial Ijust totally transformed what youthought of me in six seconds and in thispicture I had actually never had aboyfriend in real lifeI was totally uncomfortable in thephotographer was telling me to arch myback and put my hand in that guy's hairand of course barring surgery or thefake tan that I got two days ago forwork there's very little that we can doto transform how we look and how we lookthough it is superficial and immutablehas a huge impact on our lives so todayfor mefearless means being honest and I am onthis stage because I'm a model I'm onthis stage because I'm a pretty whitewoman and my industry we call that asexy girl and I'm gonna answer thequestions that people always ask me butwith an honest twist so the firstquestion is how do you become a modeland I always just say oh I was scoutedbut that means nothing the real way thatI became a model is I want a geneticlottery and I am the recipient of alegacy and maybe you're wondering whatis a legacy well for the past fewcenturies we have defined beauty notjust as health and youth and symmetrythat were biologically programmed toadmire but also as tall slender figuresand femininity and white skin and thisis a legacy that was built for me andit's a legacy that I've been cashing outon and I know there are people in theaudience who are skeptical at this pointand maybe there are some fashionistaswho are like wait Naomi Tyra Joan SmallsLiu Wen and first I commend you on yourmodel knowledge very impressive butunfortunately I have to inform you thatin 2007 a very inspired and why you PhDstudent counted all the models on therunway every single one that was hiredand of the 677 models that were hiredonly 27 or less than 4% were non-whitethe next question people always ask meis can I be a model when I grow up andthe first answer is I don't know theydon't put me in charge of that but thesecond answer and what I really want tosay to these little girls is why youknow you can be anything you could bethe president the United States or theinventor of the next Internet or a ninjacardiothoracic surgeon poet which wouldbe awesome because to be the first oneif after this amazing list they stillare like no no Cameron I want to be amodel well then I say be my boss becauseI'm not in charge of anything and youcould be the editor-in-chief of AmericanVogue at the CEO of HTM or the nextStephen Mizell saying that you want tobe a model when you grow up is akin tosaying that you want to win thePowerball when you grow up it's you knowout of your control and it's awesome andit's not a career path I willdemonstrate for you now ten years ofaccumulated model knowledge becauseunlike cardiothoracic surgeons it canjust be distilled right into right nowso if the photographer is right thereand the light is right there like a niceHMI and the client says Cameron we wanta walking shot well then this leg goesfirst nice and long this arm goes backthis arm goes forward the head is at 3/4and you just go back and forth just dothat and then you look back at yourimaginary friends three hundred fourhundred five hundred times it will looksomething like thishopefully less awkward than that one inthe middle that was I don't know whathappened there unfortunately afteryou've gone to school and you have aresume and you've done a few jobs youcan't say anything anymore so if you sayyou want to be the President of theUnited States but your resume readsunderwear model ten years people giveyou a funny look the next question we'vealways asked me is do they retouch allthe photos and yeah they pretty muchretouch all the photos but that is onlya small component of what's happeningthis picture is a very first picturethat I ever took and it's also the veryfirst time that I had worn a bikini andI didn't even have my period yet I knowwe're getting personal but uh you know Iwas a young girl this is what I lookedlike with my grandma just a few monthsearlier here's me on the same day asthis shoot my friend got to come with mehere's me at a slumber party a few daysbefore I shot French Vogue here's me onthe soccer team and in V Magazine andhere's me today and I hope what you'reseeing is that these pictures are notpictures of me they are constructionsand they are constructions byprofessionals by hair stylist and makeupartists and photographers and stylistand all of their assistants andpre-production and post-production andthey build this that's not meokay so the next question people alwaysask me is do you get free stuffI do have too many 8-inch heels which Inever get to wear except for earlier butthe free stuff that I get is the freestuff that I get in real life and that'swhat we don't like to talk about I grewup in Cambridge and one time I went intoa store and I forgot my money and theygave me the dress for free when I was ateenager I was driving with my friendwho was an awful driver and she ran aread and of course we got pulled overand all it took was a sorry officer andwe were on our way and I got these freethings because of how I look not who Iam and there are people paying a costfor how they look and not who they are Ilive in New York and last year of the140,000 teenagers that were stopped andfrisked 86% of them were black andLatino and most of them were young menand there are only 177 thousand youngblack and Latino men in New York so forthem it's not a question of will I getstopped but how many times do I getstopped when I get stopped when I wasresearching this talk I found out thatof the thirteen-year-old girls theUnited States fifty-three percent don'tlike their bodies and that number goesto 78 percent by the time that they're17 so the last question people ask me isyou know what is it like to be a modeland I think the answer that they'relooking for is if you are a little bitskinnier and you have shinier hair youwill be so happy and fabulous and onewe're backstage we give an answer thatmaybe makes it seem like that we sayit's really amazing to travel and it'samazing to get to work with creativeinspired passionate people and thosethings are true but they're only onehalf of the story because the thing thatwe never say on camera that I have neversaid on camera is I am insecure and I'minsecure because I have to think aboutwhat I look like every day and if youever are wondering you know if I havethinner thighs and shinier hair will Ibe happier you just need to meet a groupof models because they have the thinnestthighs and the shiniest hair and thecoolest clothes and they're the mostphysically insecure women probably onthe planet so when I was writing thistalk I found it very difficult to strikean honest balance because on the onehand I felt very uncomfortable to comeout here and say look I've received allthese Benit's from a deck stacked in my favor andit also felt really uncomfortable tofollow that up with and it doesn'talways make me happy but mostly it wasdifficult to unpack a legacy of genderand racial oppression when why I'm oneof the biggest beneficiaries but I'malso happy and honored to be up here andI think that it's great I got to comeyou know before 10 or 20 or 30 years hadpassed and I'd had more agency in mycareer because maybe then I wouldn'ttell the story of how I got my first jobor maybe I wouldn't tell the story ofhow I paid for college which seems soimportant right now if there's atakeaway to this talk I hope is that weall feel more comfortable acknowledgingthe power of image in our perceivedsuccesses and our perceived failuresthank you[Applause]you",

   "publishedAt": "13 Sep 2013",
   "transcription": "do you think it's possible to controlsomeone's attention even more than thatwhat about predicting human behavior Ithink those are interesting ideas if youcould I mean for me that'd be theperfect superpoweractually kind of a evil way ofapproaching it but for myself in thepast I've spent the last 20 yearssetting human behavior from a ratherunorthodox way picking pockets when wethink of misdirection we think ifsomething is looking off to the sidewhen actually it's often that things areright in front of us there are hardestthings to see the things that you lookat every day that you're blinded to forexample how many of you still have yourcell phones on you right now greatdouble check make sure you still havethem on you always doing some shoppingbeforehand now you've looked at andprobably a few times a day but i'ma askyou a question about it without lookingat your cell phone directly yet can youremember the icon in the bottom rightcorner bring them out check and see howaccurate you were how'd you do sure Ihands did we get it now that you're donelooking at those close them down becauseevery phone has something in common nomatter how you organize the icons youstill have a clock on the front sowithout looking at your phone what timewas it you just looked at your clockright it's an interesting idea now I'llask you to take that step further with agame of trust close your eyes okay Irealize I'm asking you to do that whileyou just heard there's a pickpocket inthe room but close your eyes now you'vebeen watching me for about 30 secondswith your eyes closed what am I wearingmake your best guess what color is myshirt what color is my tie now open youreyesby showing hands where you write it'sinteresting isn't it some of us are alittle bit more perceptive than othersit seems that way but I have a differenttheory about that that model ofattention they have fancy models ofattention Posner trendy model ofattention for me I like to think of itvery simple like a surveillance systemit's kind of like you have all thesefancy sentries and inside your brain isa little security guard for me I like tocall him Frankso Frankis sitting at a desk he's got all sortsof cool information in front of himhigh-tech equipment he's got camerashe's got a little phone they can pick uplisten to the ears all these senses allthese perceptions but attention is whatsteers your perceptions is what controlsyour reality it's the Gateway to themind if you don't attend to somethingyou can't be aware of it but ironicallyyou can attend to something withoutbeing aware of it that's why there's thecocktail effect we ran a party you'rehaving conversations with someone andyet you can recognize your name and youdidn't even realize you were listeningto that now for my job I have to playwith techniques to exploit this to playwith your attention as a limitedresource so if I could control how youspend your attention if I could maybesteal your attention through adistraction now instead of doing it likemisdirection and throwing off to theside instead why choose a focus on isFrank to be able to play with the Frankinside your head you're a littlesecurity guard and get you instead offocusing on your external senses just togo internal for a second so if I ask youto access a memory like what is thatwhat just happened do you have a walletyou have an American Express in yourwallet and when I do that your Frankturns around he accesses the file he hasto rewind the tape and what'sinteresting is he can't rewind the tapeat the same time they is trying toprocess new data I mean this sounds likea good theory but I could talk for along time and tell you lots of thingsand they may be true portion of them butI think it's better if I try to showthat to you here

   "publishedAt": "15 Aug 2012",
   "transcription": "[Music]if daily starts I was at a friend'shouse and she had on her shelf a copy ofthe DSM manual which is the manual ofmental disorders it lists every knownmental disorder and it used to be backin the 50s a very slim pamphlet Americabigger and bigger and bigger and nowit's 886 pages long and it listscurrently 374 mental disorders so I wasleafing through it wondering if I hadany mental disorders and it turns outI've got 12I've got generalized anxiety disorderwhich is a givenI've got nightmare disorder which iscategorized if you have recurrent dreamsof being pursued or declared to failureand all my dreams involve people chasingme down the street going you're BaileyI've got parent-child relationshipproblems which I blame my parents forI'm kiddingI'm not kidding I'm kidding and I've gotmalingering and I think it's actuallyquite rare to have both malingering andgeneralized anxiety disorder becausemalingering tends to make me feel veryanxious anyway I was looking throughthis book wondering if I was muchcrazier than I thought I was or maybeit's not a good idea to diagnoseyourself with a mental disorder ifyou're lots of trains professional ormaybe the psychiatry profession has akind of strange desire to label what'sessentially normal human behavior as amental disorder I didn't know which ofthese things was true but I thought itwas kind of interesting and I thoughtmaybe I should meet a critic ofPsychiatry to get their view which ishow I ended up having lunch with theScientologists it was a man called Brianwho runs a crack team of Scientologistswho were determined to destroypsychiatry wherever it lies there calledthe CCHR and I said to him can I can youprove to me that psychiatry is apseudoscience that can't be trustedand he said yes we can prove it to youand I said how and he said we canintroduce you to Tony and I said who'sTony and he said Tony's in broadbrought Boris Broadmoor Hospital he usedto be known as the Broadmoor asylum forthe criminally insane that's where theysaid that serial killers and the peoplewho can't help themselves and I said toobad more what did toady do that he saidhardly anythinghe beat someone up or something and hedecided to fake madness to get out of aprison sentence but he faked it too welland now he's stuck in Broadmoor andnobody will believe he's sane do youwant us to try and get you intoBroadmoor to meet Tony so I said yesplease so I got the train to Broadmoor Ibegan to yawn uncontrollably aroundKempton Park which apparently is whatdogs also do when anxious they yawnuncontrollably and we got to learn moreI got taken through gate after gateafter gate after gate into the WellnessCenter which is where you get to meetthe patients it looks like a giantHampton Inn it's all Beach and pine andcarving colors and the only bold colorsare the Reds of the panic buttonshad the patient started drifting inand they were quite overweight wearingsweat pants and quite docile looking andBrian the Scientologists whispered to methen medicated which to theScientologists is like the worst evil inthe world but I'm figured it's probablya good idea and then Brian said here'sTony and a man was walking in and hewasn't overweight he was in very goodphysical shape and he wasn't wearingsweat pants he was wearing a pinstripesuit and he had his arm outstretchedlike someone out on the apprenticehe looked like a man who wanted to wearan outfit that would convince me that hewas very sane and he sat down and I saidso is it true that you faked you were inhere and he said yep yep absolutely Ibeat someone up when I was 17 I was inprison awaiting trial and my cellmatesaid to me you know we have to do fakedmadnesstell him you're mad you'll get sent tosome cushy hospital nurses have bringyour pizzas we love you a Playstation Isaid well how did you do it say well askto see the prison psychiatrist and Ijust seen a film called crash in whichpeople get sexual pleasure from crashingcars into walls so I said to thepsychiatrist I get sexual pleasure fromcrushing cars into walls and I said whatelse he said oh yeah I told thepsychiatrist that I wanted to watchwomen as they died because it would makeme feel more normal and I said where toget loud from he's all from a biographyof Ted Bundy that they had at the prisonlibraryanyway faked madness - well he said andthey didn't send him some cushy hospitalthey sent him to Broadmoor and theminute he got there said it's what onelook at the place asked to see thepsychiatrist said there's been aterrible misunderstanding I'm notmentally ill I said how long have youbeen here for he said well if I justdone my time in prison for the originalcrime I'd have got five years I've beenin Broadmoor for 12 years Tony said thatit's a lot harder to convince peopleyou're sane than it is to convince himyou're crazy yes I thought the best wayto seem normal would be to talk topeople normally about normal things likefootball or what's on TV I subscribe tonew scientists and recently they had anarticle about the US Army was trailingbumblebees to the fat explosivesso I said to a nurse did you know thatthe US Army's training bumblebees tosniff out explosives when I read mymedical notes I saw they'd writtenbelieves bees can sniff out explosiveshe said you know they're always lookingup for non-verbal clues to my mentalstate but how do you sit in a sane wayhow do you cross your legs in the sameway it's just impossible and when Tonysaid that to me I thought to myself am Isitting like a journalist crossing mylegs like a journalist he said you knowI've got the Stockwell strangler on oneside of me and I've got the tiptoethrough the tulips rapist on the otherside of me so I tend to stay in my rooma lot because I found quite frighteningand they take Dad as a sign of madnessthey say it proves that I'm aloof andgrandiose so only in Broadmoor would notwanting to hang out with serial killersbe a side of madness anyway he seemedcompletely normal to me but what did Ithough but I've got home I emailed hispunished and honestly made and I saidwhat's the story and he said yep weaccept that toady faked madness to getout of a prison sentence because hishallucinations that had seemed quitecliched to begin with just vanished theminute he got to Broadmoor however wehave assessed him and we've determinedthat what he is is a psychopath and infact faking madness is exactly the kindof cunning and manipulative acts of apsychopath so on the checklist comingmanipulative so faking your brain goingwrong is evidence that your brain hasgone wrong and I spoke to other expertsand they said the pinstripe suit classicpsychopath speak of items 1 & 2 on thechecklist glibness superficial charm agrandiose sense of self-worth and I saidwell I said the one in hang out with thethe other patients classic psychopath itspeaks to grandiosity adore so lack ofempathy so all the things that hasseemed most normal about Tony wasevidence according to his clinician thathe was mad in this new way he was apsychopath and his clinician said to meif you want to know more aboutPsychopaths he can go on a Psychopathsspotting course run by Robert hare whoinvented the psychopathy checklist so Idid so I went on a Psychopaths possumcourse and I am now[Music]a certified and I have to say extremelyadept it's like a bats gotta so here'sthe statistics one in a hundred regularpeople is a psychopath so there's 1500people in this room 15 of you arepsychopaths[Music]although that figure rises to fourpercent of CEOs and business leaders soI think there's a very good chance isabout 30 or 40 Psychopaths in this roomit could be carnage by the end of thenight has said the reason why is becausecapitalism at its most ruthless rewardspsychopathic behavior the lack ofempathy the glibnesscunning manipulative in fact capitalismperhaps at its most remorseless is aphysical manifestation of psychopathyit's like a form of psychopathy that'scome down to affect us all the hair saidto me you know what forget about someguy at Broadmoor who may or may not havefaked madness who cares that's not a bigstory the big story he's had hiscorporate psychopathy you want to go andinterview yourself some corporatePsychopaths so I gave it a try I wroteto the Enron people I said could Icovered it for you and prison to findout if your Psychopathsthey didn't reply so I changed tack Iemailed chainsaw al Dunlap the assetstripper from the 1990s he would comeinto failing businesses and close down30% of the workforce just turn Americantowns into ghost towns and I emailed himand I said I believe you may have a veryspecial brain anomaly that makes youspecialinterested in the predatory spirit andfearless can I come and interview youabout your special brain anomaly and hesaid come on over so I went to ourdeluxe grand Florida mansion that wasfilled with sculptures of predatoryanimals there were lions and tigers hewas taking me through the garden therewere foul cones and eagles in the centerthey've got sharks and what you saymissing that less effeminate way you'vegot more sharks and you've got Tigerswas like Narniaand then we went into his kitchennow our Dunlap would be bought in tosave failing companies he'd closed down30% of the work for said he quite oftenfire people with a joke that forinstance one famous story about himsomebody came up to him and said I'vejust bought myself a new car and he saidto well you may have a new car but Itell you what you don't have a job so inhis kitchen he was standing there withhis wife Judy and his bodyguard swordand I said you know how I said in myemail that you might have a specialbrain anomaly that makes you special andhe said he has an amazing theory it'slike Star Trek you're going where no manhas gone beforeand I said well some psychologists mightsay that this makes you daddy said whatand I said it's octopus and I said I'vegot a listed psychopathic traits in mypocket can I go through them with youand he looked intrigued too despitehimself but he said okay go onand I said okay grandiose sense ofself-worth which I have to say wouldhave been hard for him to deny becausehe was standing underneath a giant oryour painting of himselfhe said well you've got to believe inyou and I said manipulative he saidthat's leadershipand I said shallow effect an inabilityto experience a range of emotions hesaid who wants to be weighed down bysome nonsense emotions so he was goingdown the psychopath checklist basicallyturning it into who moved my cheese[Music]but I did notice something happening tome the day I was without Dunlap wheneverhe said anything to me that was cut andnormal like he said no to juveniledelinquency he said he got accepted intoWest Point and they don't letdelinquents in West Point ease have notoo many short to marital relationshipshe's only ever been married twiceadmittedly his first wife cited him haddivorce papers but he once threatenedher with a knife and said he alwayswanted what human flesh tasted like butpeople say stupid things to each otherin bad marriages in the heat of anargument at his second marriage haslasted 41 years so whenever he saidanything to me that just seemed kind ofnon psychopathic I thought to myselfwell I'm not going to put bad in thebook and then I realized that becoming apsychopath spotter had kind of turned mea little bit psychopathic so I wasdesperate to shove him in a box markedpsychopath I was desperate to define himby his majesty geez I realize oh my godthis is what I've been doing for 20years it's what all journalists do wetravel across the world with ournotepads in our hands and we wait forthe gems and the gems we'll always beoutermost aspects of our intervieweespersonality we stitch them together likemedieval monks and we leave the normalstuff on the floor and you know this isa country that overdiagnosis certainmental disorders hugely childhoodbipolar children as young as four arebeing labeled bipolar because they havetemper tantrums which scores them highon their bipolar checklist when I gotback to LondonTony phoned mehe said why don't you been returning mycalls I said well they say that you're apsychopath and he said I'm not apsychopath said you know what one of theitems on the checklist is lack ofremorse but another item on thechecklist is cunning manipulative sowhen you say you feel remorse for yourcrime they say typical of the psychopathto cunningly say he feels remorse but hedoesn't is like witchcraft they turneverything upside down he said I've gota tribunal coming up will you come to itso I said okay so I went to his tribunaland after 14 years in Broadmoor let himgo they decided that he shouldn't beheld indefinitely because he scores highon a checklist that might mean that hewould as a greater than average chanceof recidivism so they let him go andoutside of the corridor he said to meyou know what John everyone's a bitpsychopathic he said you are I am wellobviously I amI said what are you gonna do now he saidI'm gonna go to Belgium because there'sa woman there that I fancy that she'smarried so I'm going to get a splitterfrom her husbandanyway that was two years ago and that'swhere my book ended and the last 20months everything was fine nothing badhappens he was living with a girloutside London he was according to Brianthe Scientologist making up for losttime which I know sounds ominous butisn't necessarily ominous unfortunatelyafter 20 months he did go back to jailfor a month he got into Africa in a barhe called it and took going to jail fora month which I know is bad but at leasta month implies that it's whatever thefrak are well was wasn't too bad andthen he phoned me and you know I thinkit's right that Tony is out because youshouldn't define people by their maddestedges and what Tony is is a he's a semipsychopath he's a gray area in a worldthat doesn't like gray areas but thegray areas are where you find thecomplexity of themso you founded humanity and that's whereyou find the truthand Tony said to me Johncould I buy you a drink at a bar - sortof thank you for everything you've donefor me and I didn't go what would youhave done thank you[Applause][Music][Applause][Music][Applause][Music]",

person sitting in your veryseats is a liar we're all liars what I'mgonna do today is I'm gonna show youwhat the research says about why we'reall Liars how you can become a lifespotter and why you might want to go theextra mile and go from life spotting totruth seeking and ultimately to trustbuilding now speaking of trust eversince I wrote this book live spotting noone wants to meet me a person anymore nono no no no they say it's okay we'lle-mail you I can't even get a coffeedate at Starbucks my husband's likehoney Deception maybe you could havefocused on cooking have a French cookingso before we get started what I'm gonnado is I'm gonna clarify my goal for youwhich is not to teach a game of gotchaly spotters aren't those in nitpickykids those kids in the back of the roomthat are shouting gotcha gotchayour eyebrow twitched you flared yournostril I watched that TV show lie to meI know you're lying no lie spiders arearmed with scientific knowledge of howto spot deception they use it to get tothe truth and they do what matureleaders do every day they have difficultconversations with difficult peoplesometimes during very difficult timesand they start up that path by acceptinga core proposition and that propositionis the followinglying is a cooperative act think aboutit a lie has no power whatsoever by itsmere utterance its power emerges whensomeone else agrees to believe the lieso I know it may sound like tough lovebut look if at some point you got liedtoit's cuz you agreed to get lied to truthnumber one about line lines acooperative act now not all lies areharmfulsometimes we're willing participants indeception for the sake of social dignitymaybe to keep a secret that should bekept secret secret we say nice songhoney you don't look fat in that no orwe say favorite of the digerati you knowI just fished that email out of my spamfolder I'm so sorry but there are timeswhen we are unwilling participants indeception and that can have dramaticcosts for us last year saw 997 billiondollars in corporate fraudalone in the United States that's aneyelash under a trillion dollars that'sseven percent of revenues deception cancost billions think Enron mad off themortgage crisis or in the case of doubleagents and traitors like Robert Hansenor Aldrich Ames lies can betray ourcountry they can compromise our securitythey can undermine democracy that cancause the deaths of those that defend usdeception is actually serious businessthis conman henry Oberlander he was suchan effective con man British authoritiessay he could have undermined the entirebanking system of the Western world andyou can't find this guy on Google youcan't find him anywhere he wasinterviewed once and he said thefollowing he said look I've got one ruleand this was Henry's rule he said lookeveryone is willing to give yousomething they're ready to give yousomething for whatever it is they'rehungry for and that's the crux of it ifyou don't want to be deceived you haveto know what is it that you're hungryfor and we all kind of hate to admit ityou know we kind of wish we were betterhusbands better wives smarter morepowerful taller richer the list goes onlying as an attempt to bridge that gapto connect our wishes and our fantasiesabout who we wish we were how we wish wecould be with what we're really like andboy are we willing to fill in those gapsin our lives with lies on a given daystudies show that you may be lied toanywhere from 10 to 200 times nowgranted many of those are white liesbut in another study it showed thatstrangers lied three times within thefirst 10 minutes of meeting each othernow when we first hear this data werecoil we can't believe how prevalentlying is we're essentially against lyingbut if you look more closely the plotactually thickens we lie more tostrangers than we lie to co-workersextroverts lie more than introverts menlie eight times more about themselvesthan they do other people women lie moreto protect other people if

epidemic in shortwhat one author calls a post truthsociety it's been very confusing for along time now what do you dowell there steps we can take to navigateour way through the morass trainedlicensed were only fifty four percentaccurate why is it so easy to learn wellthey're good liars and they're bad liarsthey're no real original liars we allmake the same mistakes we all use thesame techniques so what I'm gonna do isI'm gonna show you two patterns ofdeception and then we're gonna look atthe hot spots and see if we can findthem ourselves we're gonna start withspeech I want you to listen to me I'mgonna say this again I did not havesexual relations with that woman missLewinsky I never told anybody it's a lienot a single time never theseallegations are false and I need to goback to work for the American peopleokay what were the tell-tale signs wellfirst we heard what's known as a noncontracted denial studies show thatpeople who are over determined in theirdenial will resort to formal rather thaninformal language we also hearddistancing language that womanwe know that Liars will unconsciouslydistance themselves from their subjectusing language as their tool now PhilClinton said well they tell you thetruth or Richard Nixon's favorite in allcandor he would have been a deadgiveaway for any life spotter that knowsthe qualifying language as it's calledqualifying language like thatfurther discredits the subject now if hehad repeated the question in itsentirety or if he had peppered hisaccount with a little too much detailand we're all really glad he didn't dothat he would have further discreditedhimself Freud had it right Freud saidlook there's much more to it than speechno mortal can keep a secret if his lipsare silent he chatters with hisfingertips and we all do it no matterhow powerful you are we all chatter withour fingertips I'm going to show youDominique strauss-kahn with Obama who'schattering with his fingertipsnow this brings us to our next patternwhich is body language with bodylanguage here's what you got to do youreally got to just throw yourassumptions out the door let the sciencetemper your knowledge a little bitbecause we think Liars fidget all thetime well guess what they're known tofreeze their upper bodies when they'relying we think Liars won't look in theeyes well guess what they look you inthe eyes a little too much just tocompensate for that myth we think warmthand smiles convey honesty sincerity buta trained licensed pot a fake smile amile away can you all spot the fakesmile here you can consciously contractthe muscles in your cheeksbut the real smiles in the eyes thecrow's feet of the eyes they cannot beconsciously contracted especially if youoverdid the Botox don't overdo the Botoxnobody will think you're honest and nowwe're gonna look at the hot spots canyou tell what's happening in aconversation can you start to find thehot spots to see the discrepanciesbetween someone's words and someone'sactions now I know it seems reallyobvious but when you're having aconversation with someone that yoususpect of deception attitude is by farthe most overlooked but telling ofindicators an honest person is gonna becooperative they're gonna show they'reon your side they're gonna beenthusiastic they're gonna be willingand helpful in getting you to the truththey're gonna be willing to brainstormnamed suspects provide details they'regonna say hey maybe it was those guys inpayroll that forged those checks they'regonna be infuriated if they sense theirwrongly accused throughout the entirecourse of the interview not just inflashes they'll be infuriated throughoutthe entire course of the interview andif you ask someone honest what shouldhappen whoever did forge those checks anhonest person is much more likely torecommend strict rather than lenientpunishmentnow let's say you're having that exactsame conversation with someone deceptivethat person may be withdrawn look downlower their voicepause be kind of herky-jerky ask adeceptive person to tell their storythey're gonna pepper it with way toomuch detail in all kinds of irrelevantplaces and then they're gonna tell theirstory in strict chronological order andwhat a trained interrogator does is theycome in and in very subtle ways in overthe course of several hours they willask that person to tell their storybackwards and then they'll watch themsquirm and track which questions producethe highest volume of deceptive tellswhy do they do that well we all do thesame thing we rehearse our words but werarely rehearse our gestures we say yeswe shake our heads no we tell veryconvincing stories we slightly shrug ourshoulders we commit terrible crimes andwe smile at the delight in getting awaywith itnow that smile is known in the trade asduping delight and we're gonna see thatin several videos moving forward butwe're gonna start for those of you thatdon't know him this is presidentialcandidate John Edwards who shockedAmerica by fathering a child out ofwedlock we're gonna see him talk aboutgetting a paternity test to see now ifyou can spot him saying yes whileshaking his head no slightly shrugginghis shoulders lots of be happy toparticipate in one I know that it's notpossible that this job could be minebecause of the timing of events so Iknow it's not possible happy to take apaternity test and would love to see itare you going to do that soon is theresomebody then you can have only one sidehow can only one side of the test butI'm happy okay those head shakes aremuch easier to spot once you know tolook for them now they're gonna be timeswhen someone makes one expression whilemasking another that just kind of leaksthrough in a flash murders are known toleak sadness your new joint venturepartner might shake your hand celebratego out to dinner with you and then leakan expression of anger and we're not allgoing to become facial expressionexperts overnight here but there's one Ican teach you that's very dangerous andthat's easy to learn and that's theexpression of contemptnow the anger you've got two people inan even playing field it's stillsomewhat of a healthy relationship butwhen anger turns to contempt you've beendismissed it's associated with moralsuperiority and for that reasons it'svery very hard to recover from here'swhat it looks like it's marked by onelip corner pulled up and in it's theonly a symmetrical expression and in thepresence of contempt whether or notdeception follows and it doesn't alwaysfollow look the other way go the otherdirection reconsider the deal say nothank you I'm not coming up for just onemore nightcap thank youscience has surfaced many many moreindicators we know for example we knowLiars will shift their blink rate pointtheir feet towards an exitthey will take barrier objects and putthem between themselves and the personthat's interviewing them they'll altertheir vocal tone often making themmaking their vocal tone much lower nowhere's the deal these behaviors are justbehaviors they're not proof of deceptionthey're red flags were human beings wemake deceptive flailing gestures allover the place all day long they don'tmean anything in and of themselves butwhen you see clusters of them that'syour signal look listen probe ask somehard questions get out of that verycomfortable mode of knowing walk intocuriosity mode ask more questions have alittle dignity treat the person you'retalking to with rapport don't try to belike those folks on Law & Order andthose other TV shows that pummel theirsubjects into submission don't be tooaggressive it doesn't work now we'vetalked a little bit about how to talk tosomeone who's lying I'm gonna have aspot a lie and as I promise we're nowgonna look at what the truth looks likebut I'm gonna show you two videos twomothers one is lying one is telling thetruth and these were surfaced byresearcher David Matsumoto in Californiaand I think they're an excellent exampleof what the truth looks like this motherDiane downsshot her kids at close range drove himto the hospital while they bled all overthe car claimed a scratchy hairedstranger did it and you'll see when yousee the video shecan't even pretend to be an agonizingmother what you want to look for here isan incredible discrepancy betweenhorrific events that she describes andher very very cool demeanor and if youlook closely you'll see duping delightthroughout this video but at night whenI close my eyes I can see Christiereaching her hand out to me while I'mdriving and the blood just keep comingout of her mouth and that maybe it'llfade too with time but I don't think sothat fogs me the mostnow I'm going to show you a video of anactual grieving mother Erin Runyonconfronting her daughter's murder andtorture in court here you're gonna seeno false emotion just the authenticexpression of a mother's agony I wrotethis statement on the third anniversaryof the night you took my baby and youhurt her and you crushed her sheterrified her until her heart stoppedand she fought and I know she fought youI know she looked at you with thoseamazing brown eyes and you still wantedto kill her and I don't understand itand I never will okay there's nodoubting the veracity of those emotionsnow the technology around what the truthlooks like is progressing on the scienceof it we know for example that we nowhave specialized eye trackers infraredbrain scans MRIs that can decode thesignals that our bodies send out whenwe're trying to be deceptive and thesetechnologies are going to be marketed toall of us as panaceas for deceit andthey will prove incredibly usefulsomeday but you've got to ask yourselfin the meantime who do you want on yourside of the meeting someone who'strained in getting to the truth or someguys gonna drag a 400-poundelectroencephalogram through the doorlie spotters rely on human tools theyknow as someone once said characters whoyou are in the dark and what's kind ofinteresting is that today we have solittle darkness our world is lit up 24hours a day it's transparent with blogsand social networks broadcasting thebuzz of a whole new generation of peoplethat have made a choice to live theirlives in public it's a much more noisyworld so one challenge we have is toremember over sharing that's not honestyour manic tweeting and texting can blindus to the fact that the subtleties ofhuman decency character integrity that'sstill it matters that's always what'sgoing to matterso in this much noisier world it mightmake sense for us to be just a littlebit more explicit about our moral codewhen you combine the science ofrecognizing deception with the art oflooking listening you exempt yourselffrom collaborating in a lie you start upthat path of being just a little bitmore explicit because you signal toeveryone around you you say hey my worldour world it's going to be an honest onemy world is going to be one where truthis strengthened and false it isrecognized and marginalized and when youdo that the ground around you starts toshift just a little bit and that's thetruth[Applause][Music]you",

   "title": "Your body language may shape who you are | Amy Cuddy",
   "publishedAt": "01 Oct 2012",
   "transcription": "Translator: Joseph GeniReviewer: Morton BastSo I want to start by offering youa free no-tech life hack,and all it requires of you is this:that you change your posturefor two minutes.But before I give it away,I want to ask you to right nowdo a little audit of your bodyand what you're doing with your body.So how many of you aresort of making yourselves smaller?Maybe you're hunching, crossing your legs,maybe wrapping your ankles.Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this.Sometimes we spread out. (Laughter)I see you.So I want you to pay attentionto what you're doing right now.We're going to come backto that in a few minutes,and I'm hoping that if you learnto tweak this a little bit,it could significantly changethe way your life unfolds.So, we're really fascinatedwith body language,and we're particularly interestedin other people's body language.You know, we're interested in,like, you know \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014an awkward interaction, or a smile,or a contemptuous glance,or maybe a very awkward wink,or maybe even something like a handshake.Narrator: Here they arearriving at Number 10.This lucky policeman gets to shake handswith the President of the United States.Here comes the Prime Minister --No. (Laughter) (Applause)(Laughter) (Applause)Amy Cuddy: So a handshake,or the lack of a handshake,can have us talking for weeksand weeks and weeks.Even the BBC and The New York Times.So obviously when we thinkabout nonverbal behavior,or body language -- but we call itnonverbals as social scientists --it's language, so we thinkabout communication.When we think about communication,we think about interactions.So what is your body languagecommunicating to me?What's mine communicating to you?And there's a lot of reason to believethat this is a valid way to look at this.So social scientistshave spent a lot of timelooking at the effectsof our body language,or other people's body language,on judgments.And we make sweeping judgmentsand inferences from body language.And those judgments can predictreally meaningful life outcomeslike who we hire or promote,who we ask out on a date.For example, Nalini Ambady,a researcher at Tufts University,shows that when people watch30-second soundless clipsof real physician-patient interactions,their judgmentsof the physician's nicenesspredict whether or notthat physician will be sued.So it doesn't have to do so muchwith whether or not that physicianwas incompetent,but do we like that personand how they interacted?Even more dramatic,Alex Todorov at Princetonhas shown us that judgmentsof political candidates' facesin just one second predict 70 percentof U.S. Senate and gubernatorialrace outcomes,and even, let's go digital,emoticons used well in online negotiationscan lead you to claim more valuefrom that negotiation.If you use them poorly, bad idea. Right?So when we think of nonverbals,we think of how we judge others,how they judge usand what the outcomes are.We tend to forget, though,the other audiencethat's influenced by our nonverbals,and that's ourselves.We are also influenced by our nonverbals,our thoughts and our feelingsand our physiology.So what nonverbals am I talking about?I'm a social psychologist.I study prejudice,and I teach at a competitivebusiness school,so it was inevitable that I would becomeinterested in power dynamics.I became especially interestedin nonverbal expressionsof power and dominance.And what are nonverbal expressionsof power and dominance?Well, this is what they are.So in the animal kingdom,they are about expanding.So you make yourself big, you stretch out,you take up space,you're basically opening up.It's about opening up.And this is trueacross the animal kingdom.It's not just limited to primates.And humans do the same thing. (Laughter)So they do this both when they havepower sort of chronically,and also when they're feelingpowerful in the moment.And this one is especially interestingbecause it really shows ushow universal and old theseexpressions of power are.This expression, which is known as pride,Jessica Tracy has studied.She shows that peoplewho are born with sightand people who are congenitallyblind do thiswhen they win at a physical competition.So when they crossthe finish line and they've won,it doesn't matter if they've neverseen anyone do it.They do this.So the arms up in the V,the chin is slightly lifted.What do we do when we feel powerless?We do exactly the opposite.We close up.We wrap ourselves up.We make ourselves small.We don't want to bumpinto the person next to us.So again, both animals and humansdo the same thing.And this is what happenswhen you put together high and low power.So what we tend todo when it comes to poweris that we complementthe other's nonverbals.So if someone is beingreally powerful with us,we tend to make ourselves smaller.We don't mirror them.We do the opposite of them.So I'm watching this behaviorin the classroom,and what do I notice?I notice that MBA students really exhibitthe full range of power nonverbals.So you have peoplewho are like caricatures of alphas,really coming into the room, they getright into the middle of the roombefore class even starts,like they really want to occupy space.When they sit down,they're sort of spread out.They raise their hands like this.You have other peoplewho are virtually collapsingwhen they come in.As soon they come in, you see it.You see it on their facesand their bodies,and they sit in their chairand they make themselves tiny,and they go like thiswhen they raise their hand.I notice a couple of things about this.One, you're not going to be surprised.It seems to be related to gender.So women are much more likelyto do this kind of thing than men.Women feel chronicallyless powerful than men,so this is not surprising.But the other thing I noticedis that it also seemedto be related to the extentto which the students were participating,and how well they were participating.And this is really importantin the MBA classroom,because participationcounts for half the grade.So business schools have been strugglingwith this gender grade gap.You get these equally qualifiedwomen and men coming inand then you getthese differences in grades,and it seems to be partlyattributable to participation.So I started to wonder, you know, okay,so you have these people coming inlike this, and they're participating.Is it possible that we couldget people to fake itand would it lead themto participate more?So my main collaboratorDana Carney, who's at Berkeley,and I really wanted to know,can you fake it till you make it?Like, can you do thisjust for a little whileand actually experiencea behavioral outcomethat makes you seem more powerful?So we know that our nonverbalsgovern how other peoplethink and feel about us.There's a lot of evidence.But our question really was,do our nonverbals governhow we think and feel about ourselves?There's some evidence that they do.So, for example, we smilewhen we feel happy,but also, when we're forced to smileby holding a pen in our teethlike this, it makes us feel happy.So it goes both ways.When it comes to power,it also goes both ways.So when you feel powerful,you're more likely to do this,but it's also possiblethat when you pretend to be powerful,you are more likelyto actually feel powerful.So the second questionreally was, you know,so we know that our mindschange our bodies,but is it also truethat our bodies change our minds?And when I say minds,in the case of the powerful,what am I talking about?So I'm talking about thoughts and feelingsand the sort of physiological thingsthat make up our thoughts and feelings,and in my case, that's hormones.I look at hormones.So what do the minds of the powerfulversus the powerless look like?So powerful people tend to be,not surprisingly,more assertive and more confident,more optimistic.They actually feel they're going to wineven at games of chance.They also tend to be ableto think more abstractly.So there are a lot of differences.They take more risks.There are a lot of differencesbetween powerful and powerless people.Physiologically,there also are differenceson two key hormones: testosterone,which is the dominance hormone,and cortisol, which is the stress hormone.So what we find is that high-poweralpha males in primate hierarchieshave high testosterone and low cortisol,and powerful and effective leadersalso have high testosteroneand low cortisol.So what does that mean?When you think about power,people tended to thinkonly about testosterone,because that was about dominance.But really, power is also abouthow you react to stress.So do you want the high-powerleader that's dominant,high on testosterone,but really stress reactive?Probably not, right?You want the person who's powerfuland assertive and dominant,but not very stress reactive,the person who's laid back.So we know that in primate hierarchies,if an alpha needs to take over,if an individual needs to take overan alpha role sort of suddenly,within a few days,that individual's testosterone has gone upsignificantly and his cortisolhas dropped significantly.So we have this evidence,both that the body can shapethe mind, at least at the facial level,and also that role changescan shape the mind.So what happens, okay,you take a role change,what happens if you do thatat a really minimal level,like this tiny manipulation,this tiny intervention?\"For two minutes,\" you say,\"I want you to stand like this,and it's going to make you feelmore powerful.\"So this is what we did.We decided to bring people into the laband run a little experiment,and these people adopted, for two minutes,either high-power posesor low-power poses,and I'm just going to showyou five of the poses,although they took on only two.So here's one.A couple more.This one has been dubbedthe \"Wonder Woman\" by the media.Here are a couple more.So you can be standingor you can be sitting.And here are the low-power poses.So you're folding up,you're making yourself small.This one is very low-power.When you're touching your neck,you're really protecting yourself.So this is what happens.They come in, they spit into a vial,for two minutes, we say,\"You need to do this or this.\"They don't look at pictures of the poses.We don't want to prime themwith a concept of power.We want them to be feeling power.So two minutes they do this.We then ask them, \"How powerfuldo you feel?\" on a series of items,and then we give theman opportunity to gamble,and then we take another saliva sample.That's it. That's the whole experiment.So this is what we find.Risk tolerance, which is the gambling,we find that when you arein the high-power pose condition,86 percent of you will gamble.When you're in the low-powerpose condition,only 60 percent, and that'sa whopping significant difference.Here's what we find on testosterone.From their baseline when they come in,high-power people experienceabout a 20-percent increase,and low-power people experienceabout a 10-percent decrease.So again, two minutes,and you get these changes.Here's what you get on cortisol.High-power people experienceabout a 25-percent decrease,and the low-power people experienceabout a 15-percent increase.So two minutes leadto these hormonal changesthat configure your brainto basically be either assertive,confident and comfortable,or really stress-reactive,and feeling sort of shut down.And we've all had the feeling, right?So it seems that our nonverbals do governhow we think and feel about ourselves,so it's not just others,but it's also ourselves.Also, our bodies change our minds.But the next question, of course,is, can power posing for a few minutesreally change your lifein meaningful ways?This is in the lab, it's this little task,it's just a couple of minutes.Where can you actually apply this?Which we cared about, of course.And so we think where you want to use thisis evaluative situations,like social threat situations.Where are you being evaluated,either by your friends?For teenagers,it's at the lunchroom table.For some people it's speakingat a school board meeting.It might be giving a pitchor giving a talk like thisor doing a job interview.We decided that the onethat most people could relate tobecause most people had been through,was the job interview.So we published these findings,and the media are all over it,and they say, Okay, so this is what you dowhen you go infor the job interview, right?(Laughter)You know, so we were of coursehorrified, and said,Oh my God, no,that's not what we meant at all.For numerous reasons, no, don't do that.Again, this is not about youtalking to other people.It's you talking to yourself.What do you do before you gointo a job interview? You do this.You're sitting down.You're looking at your iPhone --or your Android, not tryingto leave anyone out.You're looking at your notes,you're hunching up, making yourself small,when really what you shouldbe doing maybe is this,like, in the bathroom, right?Do that. Find two minutes.So that's what we want to test. Okay?So we bring people into a lab,and they do either high-or low-power poses again,they go througha very stressful job interview.It's five minutes long.They are being recorded.They're being judged also,and the judges are trainedto give no nonverbal feedback,so they look like this.Imagine this is the personinterviewing you.So for five minutes, nothing,and this is worse than being heckled.People hate this.It's what Marianne LaFrance calls\"standing in social quicksand.\"So this really spikes your cortisol.So this is the job interviewwe put them through,because we really wantedto see what happened.We then have these coders lookat these tapes, four of them.They're blind to the hypothesis.They're blind to the conditions.They have no ideawho's been posing in what pose,and they end up lookingat these sets of tapes,and they say,\"We want to hire these people,\"all the high-power posers.\"We don't want to hire these people.We also evaluate these peoplemuch more positively overall.\"But what's driving it?It's not about the content of the speech.It's about the presencethat they're bringing to the speech.Because we rate themon all these variablesrelated to competence,like, how well-structured is the speech?How good is it?What are their qualifications?No effect on those things.This is what's affected.These kinds of things.People are bringingtheir true selves, basically.They're bringing themselves.They bring their ideas, but as themselves,with no, you know, residue over them.So this is what's driving the effect,or mediating the effect.So when I tell people about this,that our bodies change our mindsand our minds can change our behavior,and our behavior can changeour outcomes, they say to me,\"It feels fake.\" Right?So I said, fake it till you make it.It's not me.I don't want to get thereand then still feel like a fraud.I don't want to feel like an impostor.I don't want to get there only to feellike I'm not supposed to be here.And that really resonated with me,because I want to tell youa little story about being an impostorand feeling likeI'm not supposed to be here.When I was 19, I wasin a really bad car accident.I was thrown out of a car,rolled several times.I was thrown from the car.And I woke up in a head injury rehab ward,and I had been withdrawn from college,and I learned that my IQ had droppedby two standard deviations,which was very traumatic.I knew my IQ becauseI had identified with being smart,and I had been called gifted as a child.So I'm taken out of college,I keep trying to go back.They say, \"You're not goingto finish college.Just, you know, there are otherthings for you to do,but that's not going to work out for you.\"So I really struggledwith this, and I have to say,having your identity takenfrom you, your core identity,and for me it was being smart,having that taken from you,there's nothing that leaves you feelingmore powerless than that.So I felt entirely powerless.I worked and worked, and I got lucky,and worked, and got lucky, and worked.Eventually I graduated from college.It took me four yearslonger than my peers,and I convinced someone,my angel advisor, Susan Fiske,to take me on,and so I ended up at Princeton,and I was like,I am not supposed to be here.I am an impostor.And the night before my first-year talk,and the first-year talk at Princetonis a 20-minute talk to 20 people.That's it.I was so afraid of beingfound out the next daythat I called herand said, \"I'm quitting.\"She was like, \"You are not quitting,because I took a gambleon you, and you're staying.You're going to stay, and this iswhat you're going to do.You are going to fake it.You're going to do every talkthat you ever get asked to do.You're just going to do itand do it and do it,even if you're terrifiedand just paralyzedand having an out-of-body experience,until you have this moment where you say,'Oh my gosh, I'm doing it.Like, I have become this.I am actually doing this.'\"So that's what I did.Five years in grad school,a few years, you know,I'm at Northwestern,I moved to Harvard, I'm at Harvard,I'm not really thinking about it anymore,but for a long time I had been thinking,\"Not supposed to be here.\"So at the end of my first year at Harvard,a student who had not talkedin class the entire semester,who I had said, \"Look, you've gottaparticipate or else you're going to fail,\"came into my office.I really didn't know her at all.She came in totally defeated,and she said,\"I'm not supposed to be here.\"And that was the moment for me.Because two things happened.One was that I realized,oh my gosh,I don't feel like that anymore.I don't feel that anymore,but she does, and I get that feeling.And the second was,she is supposed to be here!Like, she can fake it, she can become it.So I was like, \"Yes, you are!You are supposed to be here!And tomorrow you're going to fake it,you're going to make yourselfpowerful, and, you know --(Applause)And you're going to gointo the classroom,and you are going to givethe best comment ever.\"You know? And she gavethe best comment ever,and people turned around and were like,oh my God, I didn't even notice hersitting there. (Laughter)She comes back to me months later,and I realized that she had not justfaked it till she made it,she had actually faked ittill she became it.So she had changed.And so I want to say to you,don't fake it till you make it.Fake it till you become it.Do it enough until you actuallybecome it and internalize.The last thing I'm goingto leave you with is this.Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes.So, this is two minutes.Two minutes, two minutes, two minutes.Before you go into the next stressfulevaluative situation,for two minutes, try doing this,in the elevator,in a bathroom stall, at your deskbehind closed doors.That's what you want to do.Configure your brainto cope the best in that situation.Get your testosterone up.Get your cortisol down.Don't leave that situation feelinglike, oh, I didn't show them who I am.Leave that situation feeling like,I really feel like I got to saywho I am and show who I am.So I want to ask you first, you know,both to try power posing,and also I want to ask you to sharethe science, because this is simple.I don't have ego involved in this.(Laughter)Give it away. Share it with people,because the people who can use it the mostare the ones with no resourcesand no technologyand no status and no power.Give it to thembecause they can do it in private.They need their bodies,privacy and two minutes,and it can significantly changethe outcomes of their life.Thank you.(Applause)",

   "title": "The future we're building -- and boring | Elon Musk",
   "publishedAt": "03 May 2017",
   "transcription": "Chris Anderson:Elon, hey, welcome back to TED.It's great to have you here.Elon Musk: Thanks for having me.CA: So, in the next half hour or so,we're going to spend some timeexploring your vision for whatan exciting future might look like,which I guess makesthe first question a little ironic:Why are you boring?EM: Yeah.I ask myself that frequently.We're trying to dig a hole under LA,and this is to create the beginningof what will hopefullybe a 3D network of tunnelsto alleviate congestion.So right now, one of the mostsoul-destroying things is traffic.It affects peoplein every part of the world.It takes away so much of your life.It's horrible.It's particularly horrible in LA.(Laughter)CA: I think you've brought with youthe first visualizationthat's been shown of this.Can I show this?EM: Yeah, absolutely.So this is the first time --Just to show what we're talking about.So a couple of key thingsthat are importantin having a 3D tunnel network.First of all, you have to be ableto integrate the entranceand exit of the tunnelseamlessly into the fabric of the city.So by having an elevator,sort of a car skate,that's on an elevator,you can integrate the entranceand exits to the tunnel networkjust by using two parking spaces.And then the car gets on a skate.There's no speed limit here,so we're designing this to be ableto operate at 200 kilometers an hour.CA: How much?EM: 200 kilometers an hour,or about 130 miles per hour.So you should be ableto get from, say, Westwood to LAXin six minutes -- five, six minutes.(Applause)CA: So possibly, initially done,it's like on a sortof toll road-type basis.EM: Yeah.CA: Which, I guess,alleviates some trafficfrom the surface streets as well.EM: So, I don't knowif people noticed it in the video,but there's no real limitto how many levels of tunnel you can have.You can go much further deepthan you can go up.The deepest mines are much deeperthan the tallest buildings are tall,so you can alleviate any arbitrarylevel of urban congestionwith a 3D tunnel network.This is a very important point.So a key rebuttal to the tunnelsis that if you add one layer of tunnels,that will simply alleviate congestion,it will get used up,and then you'll be back where you started,back with congestion.But you can go to anyarbitrary number of tunnels,any number of levels.CA: But people -- seen traditionally,it's incredibly expensive to dig,and that would block this idea.EM: Yeah.Well, they're right.To give you an example,the LA subway extension,which is -- I think it'sa two-and-a-half mile extensionthat was just completedfor two billion dollars.So it's roughly a billion dollars a mileto do the subway extension in LA.And this is not the highestutility subway in the world.So yeah, it's quite difficultto dig tunnels normally.I think we need to haveat least a tenfold improvementin the cost per mile of tunneling.CA: And how could you achieve that?EM: Actually, if you just do two things,you can get to approximatelyan order of magnitude improvement,and I think you can go beyond that.So the first thing to dois to cut the tunnel diameterby a factor of two or more.So a single road lane tunnelaccording to regulationshas to be 26 feet,maybe 28 feet in diameterto allow for crashesand emergency vehiclesand sufficient ventilationfor combustion engine cars.But if you shrink that diameterto what we're attempting,which is 12 feet, which is plentyto get an electric skate through,you drop the diameter by a factor of twoand the cross-sectional areaby a factor of four,and the tunneling cost scaleswith the cross-sectional area.So that's roughly a half-orderof magnitude improvement right there.Then tunneling machines currently tunnelfor half the time, then they stop,and then the rest of the timeis putting in reinforcementsfor the tunnel wall.So if you design the machine insteadto do continuoustunneling and reinforcing,that will give youa factor of two improvement.Combine that and that's a factor of eight.Also these machines are far from beingat their power or thermal limits,so you can jack up the powerto the machine substantially.I think you can getat least a factor of two,maybe a factor of four or fiveimprovement on top of that.So I think there's a fairlystraightforward series of stepsto get somewhere in excessof an order of magnitude improvementin the cost per mile,and our target actually is --we've got a pet snail called Gary,this is from Gary the snailfrom \"South Park,\"I mean, sorry, \"SpongeBob SquarePants.\"(Laughter)So Gary is capable of --currently he's capableof going 14 times fasterthan a tunnel-boring machine.(Laughter)CA: You want to beat Gary.EM: We want to beat Gary.(Laughter)He's not a patient little fellow,and that will be victory.Victory is beating the snail.CA: But a lot of people imagining,dreaming about future cities,they imagine that actuallythe solution is flying cars, drones, etc.You go aboveground.Why isn't that a better solution?You save all that tunneling cost.EM: Right. I'm in favor of flying things.Obviously, I do rockets,so I like things that fly.This is not some inherent biasagainst flying things,but there is a challenge with flying carsin that they'll be quite noisy,the wind force generatedwill be very high.Let's just say that if something'sflying over your head,a whole bunch of flying carsgoing all over the place,that is not an anxiety-reducing situation.(Laughter)You don't think to yourself,\"Well, I feel better about today.\"You're thinking,\"Did they service their hubcap,or is it going to come offand guillotine me?\"Things like that.CA: So you've got this visionof future cities with these rich,3D networks of tunnels underneath.Is there a tie-in here with Hyperloop?Could you apply these tunnelsto use for this Hyperloop ideayou released a few years ago.EM: Yeah, so we've beensort of puttering aroundwith the Hyperloop stuff for a while.We built a Hyperloop test trackadjacent to SpaceX,just for a student competition,to encourage innovativeideas in transport.And it actually ends up beingthe biggest vacuum chamber in the worldafter the Large Hadron Collider,by volume.So it was quite fun to do that,but it was kind of a hobby thing,and then we think we might --so we've built a little pusher carto push the student pods,but we're going to try seeinghow fast we can make the pusher goif it's not pushing something.So we're cautiously optimisticwe'll be able to be fasterthan the world's fastest bullet traineven in a .8-mile stretch.CA: Whoa. Good brakes.EM: Yeah, I mean, it's -- yeah.It's either going to smashinto tiny pieces or go quite fast.CA: But you can picture,then, a Hyperloop in a tunnelrunning quite long distances.EM: Exactly.And looking at tunneling technology,it turns out thatin order to make a tunnel,you have to --In order to seal against the water table,you've got to typically designa tunnel wall to be goodto about five or six atmospheres.So to go to vacuum is only one atmosphere,or near-vacuum.So actually, it sort of turns outthat automatically,if you build a tunnel that is good enoughto resist the water table,it is automaticallycapable of holding vacuum.CA: Huh.EM: So, yeah.CA: And so you could actually picture,what kind of length tunnelis in Elon's future to running Hyperloop?EM: I think there's no real length limit.You could dig as much as you want.I think if you were to do somethinglike a DC-to-New York Hyperloop,I think you'd probably wantto go underground the entire waybecause it's a high-density area.You're going undera lot of buildings and houses,and if you go deep enough,you cannot detect the tunnel.Sometimes people think,well, it's going to be pretty annoyingto have a tunnel dug under my house.Like, if that tunnel is dugmore than about three or fourtunnel diameters beneath your house,you will not be ableto detect it being dug at all.In fact, if you're ableto detect the tunnel being dug,whatever device you are using,you can get a lot of moneyfor that device from the Israeli military,who is trying to detecttunnels from Hamas,and from the US Customs and Border patrolthat try and detect drug tunnels.So the reality isthat earth is incredibly goodat absorbing vibrations,and once the tunnel depthis below a certain level,it is undetectable.Maybe if you have a very sensitiveseismic instrument,you might be able to detect it.CA: So you've starteda new company to do thiscalled The Boring Company.Very nice. Very funny.(Laughter)EM: What's funny about that?(Laughter)CA: How much of your time is this?EM: It's maybe ...two or three percent.CA: You've called it a hobby.This is what an Elon Muskhobby looks like.(Laughter)EM: I mean, it really is, like --This is basically internsand people doing it part time.We bought some second-hand machinery.It's kind of puttering along,but it's making good progress, so --CA: So an even bigger part of your timeis being spent on electrifyingcars and transport through Tesla.Is one of the motivationsfor the tunneling projectthe realization that actually,in a world where cars are electricand where they're self-driving,there may end up beingmore cars on the roadson any given hour than there are now?EM: Yeah, exactly.A lot of people thinkthat when you make cars autonomous,they'll be able to go fasterand that will alleviate congestion.And to some degree that will be true,but once you have shared autonomywhere it's much cheaper to go by carand you can go point to point,the affordability of going in a carwill be better than that of a bus.Like, it will cost less than a bus ticket.So the amount of driving that will occurwill be much greater with shared autonomy,and actually traffic will get far worse.CA: You started Teslawith the goal of persuading the worldthat electrificationwas the future of cars,and a few years ago,people were laughing at you.Now, not so much.EM: OK.(Laughter)I don't know. I don't know.CA: But isn't it true that pretty muchevery auto manufacturerhas announcedserious electrification plansfor the short- to medium-term future?EM: Yeah. Yeah.I think almost every automakerhas some electric vehicle program.They vary in seriousness.Some are very seriousabout transitioning entirely to electric,and some are just dabbling in it.And some, amazingly,are still pursuing fuel cells,but I think that won't last much longer.CA: But isn't there a sense, though, Elon,where you can now just declare victoryand say, you know, \"We did it.\"Let the world electrify,and you go on and focus on other stuff?EM: Yeah.I intend to stay with Teslaas far into the future as I can imagine,and there are a lot of excitingthings that we have coming.Obviously the Model 3 is coming soon.We'll be unveiling the Tesla Semi truck.CA: OK, we're going to come to this.So Model 3, it's supposedto be coming in July-ish.EM: Yeah, it's looking quite goodfor starting production in July.CA: Wow.One of the thingsthat people are so excited aboutis the fact that it's got autopilot.And you put out this video a while backshowing what that technologywould look like.EM: Yeah.CA: There's obviously autopilotin Model S right now.What are we seeing here?EM: Yeah, so this is usingonly cameras and GPS.So there's no LIDARor radar being used here.This is just using passive optical,which is essentially what a person uses.The whole road systemis meant to be navigatedwith passive optical, or cameras,and so once you solve camerasor vision,then autonomy is solved.If you don't solve vision,it's not solved.So that's why our focus isso heavily on having a vision neural netthat's very effective for road conditions.CA: Right. Many other peopleare going the LIDAR route.You want cameras plus radar is most of it.EM: You can absolutelybe superhuman with just cameras.Like, you can probably do itten times better than humans would,just cameras.CA: So the new cars being sold right nowhave eight cameras in them.They can't yet do what that showed.When will they be able to?EM: I think we're still on trackfor being able to go cross-countryfrom LA to New York by the endof the year, fully autonomous.CA: OK, so by the endof the year, you're saying,someone's going to sit in a Teslawithout touching the steering wheel,tap in \"New York,\" off it goes.EM: Yeah.CA: Won't ever have to touch the wheel --by the end of 2017.EM: Yeah. Essentially,November or December of this year,we should be able to go all the wayfrom a parking lot in Californiato a parking lot in New York,no controls touched at any pointduring the entire journey.(Applause)CA: Amazing.But part of that is possiblebecause you've already got a fleetof Teslas driving all these roads.You're accumulating a huge amountof data of that national road system.EM: Yes, but the thingthat will be interestingis that I'm actually fairly confidentit will be able to do that routeeven if you change the route dynamically.So, it's fairly easy --If you say I'm going to be really goodat one specific route, that's one thing,but it should be able to go,really be very good,certainly once you enter a highway,to go anywhere on the highway systemin a given country.So it's not sort of limitedto LA to New York.We could change itand make it Seattle-Florida,that day, in real time.So you were going from LA to New York.Now go from LA to Toronto.CA: So leaving asideregulation for a second,in terms of the technology alone,the time when someonewill be able to buy one of your carsand literally just take the handsoff the wheel and go to sleepand wake up and find that they've arrived,how far away is that, to do that safely?EM: I think that's about two years.So the real trick of itis not how do you make it worksay 99.9 percent of the time,because, like, if a car crashesone in a thousand times,then you're probably still not goingto be comfortable falling asleep.You shouldn't be, certainly.(Laughter)It's never going to be perfect.No system is going to be perfect,but if you say it's perhaps --the car is unlikely to crashin a hundred lifetimes,or a thousand lifetimes,then people are like, OK, wow,if I were to live a thousand lives,I would still most likelynever experience a crash,then that's probably OK.CA: To sleep.I guess the big concern of yoursis that people may actuallyget seduced too earlyto think that this is safe,and that you'll have some horribleincident happen that puts things back.EM: Well, I think that the autonomy systemis likely to at least mitigate the crash,except in rare circumstances.The thing to appreciateabout vehicle safetyis this is probabilistic.I mean, there's some chance that any timea human driver gets in a car,that they will have an accidentthat is their fault.It's never zero.So really the key threshold for autonomyis how much better does autonomyneed to be than a personbefore you can rely on it?CA: But once you getliterally safe hands-off driving,the power to disruptthe whole industry seems massive,because at that point you've spokenof people being able to buy a car,drops you off at work,and then you let it goand provide a sort of Uber-likeservice to other people,earn you money,maybe even cover the costof your lease of that car,so you can kind of get a car for free.Is that really likely?EM: Yeah. Absolutelythis is what will happen.So there will be a shared autonomy fleetwhere you buy your carand you can chooseto use that car exclusively,you could choose to have it be usedonly by friends and family,only by other driverswho are rated five star,you can choose to share it sometimesbut not other times.That's 100 percent what will occur.It's just a question of when.CA: Wow.So you mentioned the Semiand I think you're planningto announce this in September,but I'm curious whether there'sanything you could show us today?EM: I will show youa teaser shot of the truck.(Laughter)It's alive.CA: OK.EM: That's definitely a casewhere we want to be cautiousabout the autonomy features.Yeah.(Laughter)CA: We can't see that much of it,but it doesn't look likejust a little friendly neighborhood truck.It looks kind of badass.What sort of semi is this?EM: So this is a heavy duty,long-range semitruck.So it's the highest weight capabilityand with long range.So essentially it's meant to alleviatethe heavy-duty trucking loads.And this is something whichpeople do not today think is possible.They think the truck doesn't have enoughpower or it doesn't have enough range,and then with the Tesla Semiwe want to show that no, an electric truckactually can out-torque any diesel semi.And if you had a tug-of-war competition,the Tesla Semiwill tug the diesel semi uphill.(Laughter)(Applause)CA: That's pretty cool.And short term, these aren't driverless.These are going to be trucksthat truck drivers want to drive.EM: Yes. So what will bereally fun about thisis you have a flat torque RPM curvewith an electric motor,whereas with a diesel motor or any kindof internal combustion engine car,you've got a torque RPM curvethat looks like a hill.So this will be a very spry truck.You can drive thisaround like a sports car.There's no gears.It's, like, single speed.CA: There's a great movieto be made here somewhere.I don't know what it isand I don't know that it ends well,but it's a great movie.(Laughter)EM: It's quite bizarre test-driving.When I was driving the test prototypefor the first truck.It's really weird,because you're driving aroundand you're just so nimble,and you're in this giant truck.CA: Wait, you'vealready driven a prototype?EM: Yeah, I drove itaround the parking lot,and I was like, this is crazy.CA: Wow. This is no vaporware.EM: It's just like,driving this giant truckand making these mad maneuvers.CA: This is cool.OK, from a really badass pictureto a kind of less badass picture.This is just a cute housefrom \"Desperate Housewives\" or something.What on earth is going on here?EM: Well, this illustratesthe picture of the futurethat I think is how things will evolve.You've got an electric carin the driveway.If you look in betweenthe electric car and the house,there are actually three Powerwallsstacked up against the side of the house,and then that house roof is a solar roof.So that's an actual solar glass roof.CA: OK.EM: That's a picture of a real --well, admittedly, it's a real fake house.That's a real fake house.(Laughter)CA: So these roof tiles,some of them have in thembasically solar power, the ability to --EM: Yeah. Solar glass tileswhere you can adjustthe texture and the colorto a very fine-grained level,and then there'ssort of microlouvers in the glass,such that when you're lookingat the roof from street levelor close to street level,all the tiles look the samewhether there is a solar cellbehind it or not.So you have an even colorfrom the ground level.If you were to look at itfrom a helicopter,you would be actually ableto look through and seethat some of the glass tiles havea solar cell behind them and some do not.You can't tell from street level.CA: You put them in the onesthat are likely to see a lot of sun,and that makes these roofssuper affordable, right?They're not that much more expensivethan just tiling the roof.EM: Yeah.We're very confidentthat the cost of the roofplus the cost of electricity --A solar glass roof will be lessthan the cost of a normal roofplus the cost of electricity.So in other words,this will be economically a no-brainer,we think it will look great,and it will last --We thought about havingthe warranty be infinity,but then people thought,well, that might soundlike were just talking rubbish,but actually this is toughened glass.Well after the house has collapsedand there's nothing there,the glass tiles will still be there.(Applause)CA: I mean, this is cool.So you're rolling this outin a couple week's time, I think,with four different roofing types.EM: Yeah, we're starting offwith two, two initially,and the second twowill be introduced early next year.CA: And what's the scale of ambition here?How many houses do you believecould end up having this type of roofing?EM: I think eventuallyalmost all houses will have a solar roof.The thing is to considerthe time scale hereto be probably on the orderof 40 or 50 years.So on average, a roofis replaced every 20 to 25 years.But you don't start replacingall roofs immediately.But eventually,if you say were to fast-forwardto say 15 years from now,it will be unusual to have a roofthat does not have solar.CA: Is there a mental model thingthat people don't get herethat because of the shift in the cost,the economics of solar power,most houses actually haveenough sunlight on their roofpretty much to power all of their needs.If you could capture the power,it could pretty muchpower all their needs.You could go off-grid, kind of.EM: It depends on where you areand what the house size isrelative to the roof area,but it's a fair statement to saythat most houses in the UShave enough roof areato power all the needs of the house.CA: So the key to the economicsof the cars, the Semi, of these housesis the falling priceof lithium-ion batteries,which you've made a huge bet on as Tesla.In many ways, that's almostthe core competency.And you've decidedthat to really, like, own that competency,you just have to buildthe world's largest manufacturing plantto double the world's supplyof lithium-ion batteries,with this guy. What is this?EM: Yeah, so that's the Gigafactory,progress so far on the Gigafactory.Eventually, you can sort of roughly seethat there's sort ofa diamond shape overall,and when it's fully done,it'll look like a giant diamond,or that's the idea behind it,and it's aligned on true north.It's a small detail.CA: And capable of producing, eventually,like a hundred gigawatt hoursof batteries a year.EM: A hundred gigawatt hours.We think probably more, but yeah.CA: And they're actuallybeing produced right now.EM: They're in production already.CA: You guys put out this video.I mean, is that speeded up?EM: That's the slowed down version.(Laughter)CA: How fast does it actually go?EM: Well, when it's running at full speed,you can't actually see the cellswithout a strobe light.It's just blur.(Laughter)CA: One of your core ideas, Elon,about what makes an exciting futureis a future where we no longerfeel guilty about energy.Help us picture this.How many Gigafactories, if you like,does it take to get us there?EM: It's about a hundred, roughly.It's not 10, it's not a thousand.Most likely a hundred.CA: See, I find this amazing.You can picture what it would taketo move the worldoff this vast fossil fuel thing.It's like you're building one,it costs five billion dollars,or whatever, five to 10 billion dollars.Like, it's kind of coolthat you can picture that project.And you're planning to do, at Tesla --announce another two this year.EM: I think we'll announce locationsfor somewhere between twoand four Gigafactories later this year.Yeah, probably four.CA: Whoa.(Applause)No more teasing from you for here?Like -- where, continent?You can say no.EM: We need to address a global market.CA: OK.(Laughter)This is cool.I think we should talk for --Actually, global market.I'm going to ask you one questionabout politics, only one.I'm kind of sick of politics,but I do want to ask you this.You're on a body nowgiving advice to a guy --EM: Who?CA: Who has said he doesn'treally believe in climate change,and there's a lot of people out therewho think you shouldn't be doing that.They'd like you to walk away from that.What would you say to them?EM: Well, I think that first of all,I'm just on two advisory councilswhere the format consistsof going around the roomand asking people's opinion on things,and so there's like a meetingevery month or two.That's the sum total of my contribution.But I think to the degreethat there are people in the roomwho are arguing in favorof doing something about climate change,or social issues,I've used the meetings I've had thus farto argue in favor of immigrationand in favor of climate change.(Applause)And if I hadn't done that,that wasn't on the agenda before.So maybe nothing will happen,but at least the words were said.CA: OK.(Applause)So let's talk SpaceX and Mars.Last time you were here,you spoke about what seemed likea kind of incredibly ambitious dreamto develop rocketsthat were actually reusable.And you've only gone and done it.EM: Finally. It took a long time.CA: Talk us through this.What are we looking at here?EM: So this is one of our rocket boosterscoming back fromvery high and fast in space.So just delivered the upper stageat high velocity.I think this might have beenat sort of Mach 7 or so,delivery of the upper stage.(Applause)CA: So that was a sped-up --EM: That was the slowed down version.(Laughter)CA: I thought that wasthe sped-up version.But I mean, that's amazing,and several of these failedbefore you finallyfigured out how to do it,but now you've done this,what, five or six times?EM: We're at eight or nine.CA: And for the first time,you've actually reflownone of the rockets that landed.EM: Yeah, so we landed the rocket boosterand then prepped it for flight againand flew it again,so it's the first reflightof an orbital boosterwhere that reflight is relevant.So it's important to appreciatethat reusability is only relevantif it is rapid and complete.So like an aircraft or a car,the reusability is rapid and complete.You do not send your aircraftto Boeing in-between flights.CA: Right. So this is allowing youto dream of this really ambitious ideaof sending many, many, many people to Marsin, what, 10 or 20 years time, I guess.EM: Yeah.CA: And you've designedthis outrageous rocket to do it.Help us understandthe scale of this thing.EM: Well, visuallyyou can see that's a person.Yeah, and that's the vehicle.(Laughter)CA: So if that was a skyscraper,that's like, did I read that,a 40-story skyscraper?EM: Probably a little more, yeah.The thrust level of this is really --This configuration is about four timesthe thrust of the Saturn V moon rocket.CA: Four times the thrust of the biggestrocket humanity ever created before.EM: Yeah. Yeah.CA: As one does.EM: Yeah.(Laughter)In units of 747, a 747 is only abouta quarter of a million pounds of thrust,so for every 10 million pounds of thrust,there's 40 747s.So this would be the thrust equivalentof 120 747s, with all engines blazing.CA: And so even with a machinedesigned to escape Earth's gravity,I think you told me last timethis thing could actuallytake a fully loaded 747,people, cargo, everything,into orbit.EM: Exactly. This can takea fully loaded 747 with maximum fuel,maximum passengers,maximum cargo on the 747 --this can take it as cargo.CA: So based on this,you presented recentlythis Interplanetary Transport Systemwhich is visualized this way.This is a scene you picture in, what,30 years time? 20 years time?People walking into this rocket.EM: I'm hopeful it's sort ofan eight- to 10-year time frame.Aspirationally, that's our target.Our internal targetsare more aggressive, but I think --(Laughter)CA: OK.EM: While vehicle seems quite largeand is large by comparisonwith other rockets,I think the future spacecraftwill make this look like a rowboat.The future spaceshipswill be truly enormous.CA: Why, Elon?Why do we need to build a city on Marswith a million peopleon it in your lifetime,which I think is kind ofwhat you've said you'd love to do?EM: I think it's important to havea future that is inspiring and appealing.I just think there have to be reasonsthat you get up in the morningand you want to live.Like, why do you want to live?What's the point? What inspires you?What do you love about the future?And if we're not out there,if the future does not includebeing out there among the starsand being a multiplanet species,I find that it's incredibly depressingif that's not the futurethat we're going to have.(Applause)CA: People want to position thisas an either or,that there are so many desperate thingshappening on the planet nowfrom climate to povertyto, you know, you pick your issue.And this feels like a distraction.You shouldn't be thinking about this.You should be solving what's here and now.And to be fair, you've donea fair old bit to actually do thatwith your work on sustainable energy.But why not just do that?EM: I think there's --I look at the futurefrom the standpoint of probabilities.It's like a branchingstream of probabilities,and there are actions that we can takethat affect those probabilitiesor that accelerate one thingor slow down another thing.I may introduce something newto the probability stream.Sustainable energywill happen no matter what.If there was no Tesla,if Tesla never existed,it would have to happen out of necessity.It's tautological.If you don't have sustainable energy,it means you have unsustainable energy.Eventually you will run out,and the laws of economicswill drive civilizationtowards sustainable energy,inevitably.The fundamental valueof a company like Teslais the degree to which it acceleratesthe advent of sustainable energy,faster than it would otherwise occur.So when I think, like,what is the fundamental goodof a company like Tesla,I would say, hopefully,if it accelerated that by a decade,potentially more than a decade,that would be quite a good thing to occur.That's what I consider to bethe fundamentalaspirational good of Tesla.Then there's becoming a multiplanetspecies and space-faring civilization.This is not inevitable.It's very important to appreciatethis is not inevitable.The sustainable energy futureI think is largely inevitable,but being a space-faring civilizationis definitely not inevitable.If you look at the progress in space,in 1969 you were ableto send somebody to the moon.1969.Then we had the Space Shuttle.The Space Shuttle could onlytake people to low Earth orbit.Then the Space Shuttle retired,and the United Statescould take no one to orbit.So that's the trend.The trend is like down to nothing.People are mistaken when they thinkthat technologyjust automatically improves.It does not automatically improve.It only improves if a lot of peoplework very hard to make it better,and actually it will, I think,by itself degrade, actually.You look at great civilizationslike Ancient Egypt,and they were able to make the pyramids,and they forgot how to do that.And then the Romans,they built these incredible aqueducts.They forgot how to do it.CA: Elon, it almost seems,listening to youand looking at the differentthings you've done,that you've got this uniquedouble motivation on everythingthat I find so interesting.One is this desire to workfor humanity's long-term good.The other is the desireto do something exciting.And often it feels like you feellike you need the one to drive the other.With Tesla, you wantto have sustainable energy,so you made these super sexy,exciting cars to do it.Solar energy, we need to get there,so we need to make these beautiful roofs.We haven't even spokenabout your newest thing,which we don't have time to do,but you want to save humanity from bad AI,and so you're going to createthis really cool brain-machine interfaceto give us all infinite memoryand telepathy and so forth.And on Mars, it feelslike what you're saying is,yeah, we need to save humanityand have a backup plan,but also we need to inspire humanity,and this is a way to inspire.EM: I think the valueof beauty and inspirationis very much underrated,no question.But I want to be clear.I'm not trying to be anyone's savior.That is not the --I'm just trying to think about the futureand not be sad.(Applause)CA: Beautiful statement.I think everyone here would agreethat it is not --None of this is goingto happen inevitably.The fact that in your mind,you dream this stuff,you dream stuff that no one elsewould dare dream,or no one elsewould be capable of dreamingat the level of complexity that you do.The fact that you do that, Elon Musk,is a really remarkable thing.Thank you for helping us allto dream a bit bigger.EM: But you'll tell me if it everstarts getting genuinely insane, right?(Laughter)CA: Thank you, Elon Musk.That was really, really fantastic.That was really fantastic.(Applause)",

   "transcription": "[Music][Music][Applause]soi'll start with this a couple of yearsago an event planner called me because iwas going to do a speaking eventand she called and she said i'm reallystruggling with how to write about youon the little flyerand i thought well what's the struggleand she said well i saw you speak and ii i'm going to call you a researcher ithink but i'm afraid if i call yourresearcher no one will come becausethey'll think you're boring andirrelevantand it's like okay and she said so butthe thing i liked about your talk is youknow you're a storyteller so i thinkwhat i'll do is just call you astorytellerand of course the academic insecure partof me was likeyou're gonna call me a what and she saidi'm gonna call you a storyteller and iwas likeoh why not magic pixiei was like i i don't i let me thinkabout this for a second and soi tried to call deep on my courage and ithoughtyou know i am a storyteller i'm aqualitative researcher i collect storiesthat's what i doand maybe stories are just data with asoul you know and maybe i'm justa storyteller so i said you know whatwhy don't you just say i'm a researcherstorytellerand she went there's no such thingso i'm a researcher or storyteller andi'm going to talk to you today we'retalking about expandingperception and so i want to talk to youand tell some stories abouta piece of my research thatfundamentally expanded my perceptionand really actually changed the way thati live and love and work and parentand this is where my story starts when iwas a young researcher doctoral studentmy first year i had a research professorwho said to ushere's the thing if you cannot measureit it does notexist and i thought he was just sweettalking me i was likereally and he's like absolutely so youhave to understand that i havea bachelor's in social work a master'sin social work and i was getting my phdin social work so my entire academiccareerwas surrounded by people who kind ofbelieved in the life's messylove it you know and i'm more the life'smessyclean it up organize it and put it intoa bento boxum and so tothink that i had found my way to found acareerthat takes me you know really one of thebig sayingsin in social work is lean into thediscomfort of the workand i'm like you know knock discomfortupside the head and move it overand get all a's that's my that was mymantraso i was very excited about this and soi thought you know whatthis is the career for me because i aminterested in some messy topicsbut i want to be able to make them notmessyi want to understand them i want to hackinto these things i know are importantand lay the code out for everyone to seeso where i startedwas with connection because by the timeyou're a social worker for10 years what you realize is thatconnection is why we're here it's whatgives purpose and meaning to our livesthis is this is what it's all about itdoesn't matter whether you talk topeople who work in social justice andmental healthand abuse and neglect what we know isthat connectionthe ability to feel connected isneurobiologically that's how we're wiredit's why we're hereso i thought you know what i'm going tostart with connectionwell you know that that situation whereyou get an evaluation from your bossand she tells you 37 things that you doreally awesome and one thing that youcan't you know an opportunity for growthand all you can think about is thatopportunity for growth rightwell apparently this is the way my workwent as well becausewhen you ask people about love they tellyou about heartbreakwhen you ask people about belongingthey'll tell you the mostexcruciating experiences of beingexcludedand when you ask people about connectionthe stories they told me were aboutdisconnectionso very quickly really about six weeksinto this research i ran intothis unnamed thing that absolutelyunraveled connectionin a way that i didn't understand or hadnever seen and so i pulled back out ofthe research and thought i need tofigure out what this isand it turned out to be shameand shame is really easily understood asthe fear of disconnectionis there something about me that ifother people know it or see itthat i won't be worthy of connectionthe things i can tell you about it'suniversal we all have it the only peoplewho don't experience shame have nocapacity for humanempathy or connection no one wants totalk about it and the less you talkabout it the more you have itwhat underpinned this shame this i'm notgood enoughwhich we all know that feeling i'm notblank enough i'm not thin enough richenough beautiful enough smart enoughpromoted enough um the thing thatunderpinned thiswas excruciating vulnerabilitythis idea of in order for connection tohappenwe have to allow ourselves to be seenreally seenand you know how i feel aboutvulnerability i hate vulnerability andsoi thought this is my chance to beat itback with my measuring sticki'm going in i'm going to figure thisstuff out i'm going to spend a yeari'm going to totally deconstruct shamei'm going to understand howvulnerability works and i'm going tooutsmart itso i was ready and i was really excitedas you know it's not going to turn outwellyou know this so i could tell you a lotabout shamebut i'd have to borrow everyone else'stime but here's what i can tell you thatit boils down toand this may be one of the mostimportant things that i've ever learnedin the decade of doing this researchmy one years turned into six yearsthousands of stories hundreds of longinterviewsfocus groups at one point people weresending me journal pages and sending metheir storiesthousands of pieces of data and sixyearsand i kind of got a handle on it i kindof understood this is what shame is thisis how it worksi wrote a book i published a theorybut something was not okay and what itwas is that if i roughly took the peoplei interviewedand divided them into peoplewho really have a sense of worthinessthat's what this comes down to a senseof worthinessthey have a strong sense of love andbelongingand folks who struggle for it and folkswho are alwayswondering if they're good enough therewas only one variable that separated thepeople who have a strong sense of loveand belongingand the people who really struggle forit and that was the people who have astrong sense of love and belongingbelieve they're worthy of love andbelongingthat's it they believe they're worthyand to me the hard part ofthe one thing that keeps us out ofconnection is our fear that we're notworthy of connectionwith something that personally andprofessionally i felt like i needed tounderstand betterso what i did is itook all of the interviews where i sawworthiness where i saw people livingthat wayand just looked at those what do thesepeople have in common and i havei have a slight office supply addictionbut that's another talkso i had a manila notebook a manilafolder and i had a sharpieand i was like what am i going to callthis research and the first words thatcame to my mind werewholehearted these are kind ofwholehearted people living from thisdeep sense of worthiness so i wrote atthe top of the manila folderand i started looking at the data infact i did it firstin this very four in a four dayvery intensive data analysis where iwent back pulled these interviews pulledthe stories pulled the incidentswhat's the what's the theme what's thepatternmy husband left town with the kids umbecause i always go into this kind ofjackson pollock crazy thing where i'mjust likewriting and going and kind of just in myresearcher modeand so here's what i foundwhat they had in common was a sense ofcourageand i want to separate courage andbravery for you for a minutecourage the original definition ofcourage when it first came into theenglish language it's from the latinword curmeaning heart and the originaldefinition was to tell the story of whoyou are with your whole heartand so these folks had very simply thecourage to be imperfectthey had the compassion to be kind tothemselves firstand then to others because as it turnsout we can't practice compassion withother people if we can't treat ourselveskindlyand the last was they had connection andthis was the hard partas a result of authenticity they werewilling to let go of who they thoughtthey should bein order to be who they were which isyou have toabsolutely do that for connectionthe other thing that they had in commonwas thisthey fully embraced vulnerabilitythey believedthat what made them vulnerable made thembeautifulthey didn't talk about vulnerabilitybeing comfortablenor did they really talk about it beingexcruciating as i had heardearlier in the shame interviewing theyjust talked about it being necessarythey talked about the willingness to sayi love you firstthe willingness todo something where there are noguaranteesthe willingness to breathe throughwaiting for the doctor to call afteryour mammogramthe willing to invest in a relationshipthat may or may not work out theythought this was fundamentali personally thought it was betrayali could not believe i had pledgedallegiance to researchwhere our job you know the definition ofresearch is to control control andpredicta steady phenomenon for the reason forthis explicit reason to control andpredictand now my very you know my mission tocontrol and predicthad turned up the answer that the way tolive is with vulnerabilityand to stop controlling and predictingthis led toa little breakdownwhich actually looked more like thisand it did it led to a i called abreakdown my therapist calls it aspiritual awakeningspiritual lightning sounds better thanbreakdown but i assure you it was abreakdownand i had to put my data away and gofind a therapist let me tell yousomethingyou know who you are when you call yourfriends and say i think i need to seesomebodywho do you have any recommendationsbecause about five my friend's likei wouldn't want to be your therapist umand i was like what does that mean andthey're like i'm just saying you knowlikedon't bring your measuring stickokay so i found a therapistmy first meeting with her dianai brought in my list of the way thewholehearted liveand i sat down and she said you know howare you and i saidi'm great you know i'm i'm okay and shesaid what's going on and i saidand this is a therapist who seestherapists becausewe have to go to those because their bsmeters aregoodand so i said here's the thing i'mstrugglingand she said what's the struggle and isaid well i have a vulnerability issueand you know and i know thatvulnerability is kind of the coreof shame and fear and our struggle forworthinessbut it appears that it's also thebirthplace of joyof creativity a belonging of loveand i think i have a problem andi just i need some help and i said buthere's the thingno family stuff no childhood [ __ ] i justi just need some strategiesthank you umso she goes like thisand then i said it's bad right she saidit's neither good nor badit just is what it is and i said oh mygod this is gonnasuck umand it did and it didn't um and it tookabout a yearand you know how there are people thatlike when they realize thatvulnerabilityand tenderness are important that theykind of surrender and walk into ita that's not me and b i don't even hangout with people like thatfor me it was a year-long street fightit was a slugfest vulnerability pushed ipushed backi lost the fight butprobably won my life back and so then iwent back into the research and spentthe next couple of yearsreally trying to understand what theythe wholeheartedum what the choices they were making andand what what iswhat what are we doing withvulnerability whydo we struggle with it so much am ialone in struggling with vulnerabilityno so this is what i learnedwe numb vulnerability when we're waitingfor the callit was funny i sent something out ontwitter and on facebook that sayshow would you define vulnerability whatmakes you feel vulnerable and within anhour and a half i had 150 responsesbecause i wanted to know you know what'sout therehaving to ask my husband for helpbecause i'm sick and we're newly marriedum initiating sex with my husbandinitiating sex with my wife being turneddownasking someone out waiting for thedoctor to call backgetting laid off laying off people thisis the world we live inwe live in a vulnerable world and one ofthe ways we deal with it is we numbvulnerabilityand i think there's evidence and it'snot the only reason this evidence existsbut i think that there it's a huge causewe are the most in debtobese addictedand medicated adult cohort in u.shistorythe problem is and i learned this fromthe researchthat you cannot selectively numb emotionyou can't say here's the bad stuffhere's vulnerability here's grief here'sshame here's fear here's disappointmenti don't want to feel these i'm going tohave a couple of beers and a banana nutmuffini don't want to feel these and i knowthat's i know that's knowing laughter ii hack into your lives for a living iknow that's oh godyou can't numb those hard feelingswithout numbing the other affects ouremotions you cannot selectively numbso when we numb those we numbjoy we numb gratitudewe numb happiness and thenwe are miserable and we are looking forpurpose and meaningand then we feel vulnerable so then wehave a couple of beers and a banana nutmuffinand it becomes this dangerous cycle umone of the things that i think that weneed to think aboutis why and how we numb and it doesn'tjust have to be addictionthe other thing we do is we makeeverything that's uncertain certainreligion has gone from a belief in faithand mysteryto certainty i'm right you're wrong shutupthat's it just certainthe more afraid we are the morevulnerable we are the moreafraid we are this is what politicslooks like today there's no discourseanymorethere's no conversation there's justblame you know what blame you know howblame is described in the researcha way to discharge pain and discomfortwe perfect if there's anyone who wantstheir life to look like thisit would be me but it doesn't workbecause what we do is we take fat fromour butts and put it in our cheekswhich just i hope in 100 years peoplewill look back and go wowand we perfect most dangerously arechildrenlet me tell you what we think aboutchildren they're hardwired for strugglewhen they get herewhen you hold those perfect littlebabies in your hand our job is not tosaylook at her she's perfect my job is justto keep her perfect make sure she makesthe tennis team by fifth grade and yaleby seventh gradethat's not our job our job is to lookand say you know what you're imperfectand you'rewired for struggle but you are worthy oflove and belongingthat's our job show me a generation ofkids raised like thatand we'll end the problems i think thatwe see todaywe pretendthat what we do doesn't have an effecton peoplewe do that in our personal lives we dothat corporate whether it's a bailout anoil spilla recall we pretend like what we'redoing doesn't have a huge impact onother peoplei would say to companies this is not ourfirst rodeo peoplewe just need you to be authentic andreal and saywe're sorry we'll fix itbut there's another way and i'll leaveyou with this this is what i have foundto let ourselves be seen deeply seenvulnerably seento love with our whole hearts eventhough there's no guaranteeand that's really hard and i can tellyou as a parent that's excruciatinglydifficultto practice gratitude and joy in thosemoments of kind of terrorwhen we're wondering can i love you thismuch can i believe in this aspassionatelycan i be this fierce about this just tobe able to stop and instead ofcatastrophizing what might happen to sayi'm just so gratefulbecause to feel this vulnerable meansi'm aliveand the last which i think is probablythe most importantis to believe that we're enough becausewhen we work from a placei believe that says i'm enoughthen we stop screaming and startlisteningwe're kinder and gentler to the peoplearound us and we're kinder and gentlerto ourselvesthat's all i have[Music][Music]sharing that's video on the humannetworkcisco welcome to the human network",

why does yourorganization exist why do you get out ofbed in the morning and why should anyonecare well as a result the way we thinkthe way we act the way we communicate isfrom the outside and it's obvious we gofrom the clearest thing to the fuzziestthing but the inspired leaders and theinspire or inspired organizationsregardless of their size regardless oftheir industry all think act andcommunicate from the inside out let megive you an example I use Apple becausethey're easy to understand and everybodygets it if Apple were like everyone elsea marketing message from them mightsound like this we make great computersthey're beautifully designed simple touse and user friendly want to buy oneand that's how most of us communicatethat's how most marketing is done that'show most sales done and that's how mostof us communicate interpersonally wesave what we do we say how we'redifferent or how we better and we expectsome sort of behavior or purchase a votesomething like that here is our new lawfirm we have the best lawyers with thebiggest clients we have you know wealways perform for our clients dobusiness with us here's our new car itgets great gas mileage it has you knowleather seats by our car but it'suninspiring here's how Apple actuallycommunicateseverything we do we believe inchallenging the status quo we believe inthinking differently the way wechallenge the status quo is by makingour products beautifully designed simpleto use and user friendly we just happento make great computers wanna buy onetotally different right you ready to buya computer from me all I did was reversethe order of the information what itproves to us is that people don't buywhat you do people buy why you do itpeople don't buy what you do they buywhy you do itthis explains why every single person inthis room is perfectly comfortablebuying a computer from Apple but we'realso perfectly comfortable buying an mp3player from Apple or a phone from Appleor a DVR from Apple but as I said beforeApple is just a computer company there'snothing that distinguishes themstructurally for many of theircompetitors their competitors are allequally qualified to make all of theseproducts in fact they tried a few yearsago gateway came out with flat-screenTVs they're eminently qualified to makeflat-screen tvs they've been making someflat-screen monitors for years nobodybought one Dell came out with mp3players and PDAs and they make greatquality products and they can makeperfectly well design products andnobody bought one in fact talking aboutit now we can't even imagine buying anmp3 player from Dell why would you buyan mp3 player from a computer companybut we do it every day people don't buywhat you do they buy why you do it thegoal is not to do business with anybodywith everybody who needs what you havethe goal is to do business with peoplewho believe what you believehere's the best part none of what I'mtelling you is my opinion it's allgrounded in the tenets of biology notpsychology biology if you look at across-section of the human brain lookingfrom the top down what you see is thehuman brain is actually broken intothree major components that correlateperfectly with the golden circle ournewest brain our Homo Sapien brain ourneocortex corresponds with the whatlevel the neocortex is responsible forall of our rational and analyticalthoughtand language the middle two sectionsmake up our limbic brains and our limbicbrains are responsible for all of ourfeelings like trust and loyalty it'salso responsible for all human behaviorall decision-making and it has nocapacity for language in other wordswhen we communicate from the outside inyes people can understand vast amountsof complicated information like featuresand benefits and facts and figuresit just doesn't drive behavior when wecommunicate from the inside out we'retalking directly to the part of thebrain that controls behavior and then weallow people to rationalize it with thetangible things we say and do this iswhere gut decisions come from you knowsometimes you can give somebody all thefacts and your figures in these I knowwhat all the facts in detail say but itjust doesn't feel right why would we usethat verb it doesn't feel rightbecause the part of the brain thatcontrols decision-making doesn't controllanguage and the best we can muster upis I don't know it just doesn't feelright or sometimes you say you'releading with your heart or you'releading with your soul well I hate tobreak it to you those aren't other bodyparts controlling your behavior it's allhappening here in your limbic brain thepart of the brain that controlsdecision-making and not language but ifyou don't know why you do what you doand people respond to why you do whatyou do then how will anybody how willyou ever get people to vote for you orbuy something from you or moreimportantly be loyal and want to be apart of what it is what you bet you doagain the goal is not just as to sellpeople who need what you have the goalis to sell to people who believe whatyou believe the goal is not just to hirepeople who need a job it's to hirepeople who believe what you believe Ialways say that you know this if you ifyou if you hire people just because theycan do a job they'll work for your moneybut if you hire people who believe whatyou believe they work for you with bloodand sweat and tears and no air nowhereelse is there a better example of thisthan with the Wright brothers mostpeople don't know about Samuel PierpontLangley and back in the early 20thcentury the pursuit of powered manflight was like the dot-com of the dayeverybody was trying it and SamuelPierpont Langley had what we assume tobe the recipe for successI mean even now we you asked people whydid your product or why did your companyfail and people always give you thepermeate same permutation of the samethree things undercapitalizedthe wrong people bad market conditionsit was the same three things so let'sexplore that Samuel Pierpont Langley wasgiven fifty thousand dollars by the WarDepartment to figure out this flyingmachine money was no problem he held aseat at Harvard and worked at theSmithsonian and was extremelywell-connected he knew all the big mindsof the day he hired the best minds moneycould find and the market conditionswere fantasticthe New York Times followed him aroundeverywhere and everyone was rooting forLangley and how come we've never heardof Samuel Pierpont Langley a few hundredmiles away in Dayton Ohio Orville andWilbur Wright they had none of what weconsider to be the recipe for successthey had no money they paid for theirdream with the proceeds from theirbicycle shop not a single person on theWright brothers team had a collegeeducationnot even Orville or Wilbur and the NewYork Times followed them around nowherethe difference was Orville and Wilburwere driven by a caused by a purpose bya belief they believed that if theycould figure out this flying machineit'll change the course of the worldSamuel Pierpont Langley was different hewanted to be rich and he wanted to befamous he was in pursuit of the resulthe was in pursuit of the riches and loand behold look what happened the peoplewho believed in the Wright brothersdream worked with them with blood andsweat and tears the others just workedfor the paycheck and they tell storiesof how every time the Wright brotherswent out they would have to take fivesets of parts because that's how manytimes they would crash before they camein for supper and eventually on December17th 1903 the Wright brothers tookflightand no one was there to even experienceit we found out about it a few dayslater and further proof that Langley wasmotivated by the wrong thing the day theWright brothers took flight he quit hecould have said that's an amazingdiscovery guys and I will improve uponyour technology but he didn't he wasn'tfirst he didn't get rich he didn't getfamous so he quit people don't buy whatyou do they buy why you do it and if youtalk about what you believe you willattract those who believe what youbelieve well why is it important toattract those who believe what youbelieve something called the law ofdiffusion of innovation and if you don'tknow the law you definitely know theterminology the first two and a halfpercent of our population are ourinnovators the next thirteen and a halfpercent of our population are our earlyadopters the next thirty four percentare your early majority your latemajority and your laggards the onlyreason these people by touch-tone phonesis because you can't buy rotary phonesanymore[Music]we all sit at various places at varioustimes on the scale but with the law ofdiffusion of innovation tells us is thatif you want mass-market success ormass-market acceptance of an idea youcannot have it until you achieve thistipping point between 15 and 18 percentmarket penetration and then the systemtips and I love asking businesses what'syour conversion on new business and theylove to sell you oh it's about 10percent proudly well you can trip over10 percent of the customers we all haveabout 10 percent who just get it that'show we describe them right that's likethat gut feeling oh they just get it theproblem is how do you find the ones thatjust get it before you're doing businesswith them versus the ones who don't getitso it's this here this little gap thatyou have to close as Jeffrey Moore callsit crossing the chasm because you seethe early majority will not trysomething until someone else has triedit first and these guys the innovatorsin the early adopters they'recomfortable making those gut decisionsthey're more comfortable making thoseintuitive decisions that are driven bywhat they believe about the world andnot just what product is available theseare the people who stood on line for sixhours to buy an iPhone when they firstcame out when you could have just walkedinto the store the next week and boughtone off the shelf these are the peoplewho spent $40,000 on flat-screen TVswhen they first came out even though thetechnology was substandard and by theway they didn't do it because thetechnology was so great they did it forthemselves it's because they wanted tobe first people don't buy what you dothey buy why you do it and what you dosimply proves what you believe in factpeople will do the things that provewhat they believe the reason that personbought the iPhone on the first in thefirst six hours a student stood in linefor six hours was because of what theybelieved about the world and how theywanted everybody to see them they werefirst people don't buy what you do theybuy why you do it so let me give you afamous example a famous failure and afamous success of the law of diffusionof innovation first the famous failureit's a commercial example as we saidbefore a second ago the recipe forsuccess is money and the right people inthe right marketright you should have success then lookat TiVo from the time TiVo came outabout eight or nine years ago to thiscurrent day they are the single highestquality product on the market hands downthere is no dispute they were extremelywell-funded market conditions werefantastic I mean we use TiVo as a verblike TiVo stuff on my piece of junk TimeWarner DVR all the time but TiVo is acommercial failure they've never mademoney and when they went IPO their stockwas at about 30 or $40 and thenplummeted and it's never traded aboveten in fact I don't thinks it's eventraded above six except for a couple oflittle spikes because you see when TiVolaunched their product they told us allwhat they had they said we have aproduct that pauses live TV skipscommercials rewinds live TV andmemorizes your viewing habits withoutyou even asking and the cynical majoritysaid we don't believe you we don't needit we don't like it you're scaring uswhat if they had said if you're the kindof person who likes to have totalcontrol over every aspect of your lifeboy do we have a product for you itpauses live TV skips commercialsmemorizes your viewing habits etc etcpeople don't buy what you do they buywhy you do it and what you do simplyserves as the proof of what you believenow let me give you a successful exampleof the law of diffusion of innovation inthe summer of 1963 250,000 people showedup on the mall in Washington to hear dr.King speak they sent out no invitationsand there was no website to check thedate how do you do that well dr. Kingwasn't the only man in America who wasthe who's a great orator he wasn't theonly man in America who suffered in apre-civil Rights America in fact some ofhis ideas were bad but he had a gift hedidn't go around telling people whatneeded to change in America you know hewent around and told people what hebelievedI believe I believe I believe he toldpeople and people who believe what hebelieved took his cause and they made ittheir own and they told people and someof those people created structures toget the word out to even more people andlo and behold 250,000 people showed upon the right day on the right time tohear him speak how many of them showedup for himzero they showed up for themselves it'swhat they believed about America thatgot them to travel on a bus for eighthours to stand in the Sun in Washingtonfor in the middle of August it's whatthey believed and it wasn't about blackversus white 25 percent of the audiencewas white dr. King believed that therewere two types of laws in this worldthose that are made by a higherauthority Authority and those that aremade by man and not until all the lawsthat are made by man are consistent withthe laws that are made by the higherauthority will we live in a just worldit just so happens that the civil rightsmovement was the perfect thing to helphim bring his cause to life we followedhim not for him but for ourselves and bythe way he gave the I have a dreamspeech not the I have a planned speech[Music]listen to politicians now with thecomprehensive 12-point plans are notinspiring anybody because there wereleaders and there are those who leadleaders hold a position of power orauthority but those who lead inspire uswith other individuals or organizationswe follow those who lead because we haveto but because we want to we followthose who lead not for them but forourselves and it's those who start withY that have the ability to inspire thosearound them or find others who inspirethem thank you very much[Music][Music]shirring that's video on the humanNetwork Cisco welcome to the humanNetwork",

   "publishedAt": "08 Mar 2016",
   "transcription": "all right I want to see a show of handshow many of you have unfriended someoneon Facebook because they said somethingoffensive about politics or religionchild care food and how many of you knowat least one person that you avoidbecause you just don't want to talk tothem you know it used to be that inorder to have a polite conversation wejust had to follow the advice of HenryHiggins in my fair lady stick to theweather and your health but these dayswith climate change in anti-vaccinethose subjects are not safe eitherso this world that we live in this worldin which every conversation has thepotential to devolve into an argumentwhere our politicians can't speak to oneanother and where even the most trivialof issues have someone fighting bothpassionately for it and against it it'snot normal pew research did a study of10,000 American adults and they foundthat at this moment we are morepolarized we are more divided than weever have been in history we're lesslikely to compromise which means we'renot listening to each other and we makedecisions about where to live who tomarry and even who our friends are goingto be based on what we already believeagain that means we're not listening toeach other a conversation requires abalance between talking and listeningand somewhere along the way we lost thatbalance now part of that is due totechnology the smart phones that you alleither have in your hands or closeenough that you could grab them reallyquickly according to Pew Research abouta third of American teenagers send morethan a hundred texts a day and many ofthem almost most of them are more likelyto text their friends than they are totalk to them face to face there's thisgreat piece in the Atlantic it waswritten by a high school teacher namedPaul Barnwell and he gave his kids acommunication project he wanted to teachhim how to speak on a specific subjectwithout using notes and he said this Icame to realizeI came to realize that conversationalcompetence might be the single mostoverlooked skill we fail to teach kidsspend hours each day engaging with ideasand each other through screens butrarely do they have an opportunity tohone their interpersonal communicationskills it might sound like a funnyquestion but we have to ask ourselves isthere any 21st century skill moreimportant than being able to sustainsustained coherent confidentconversation now I make my livingtalking to people Nobel Prize winnerstruck drivers billionaires kindergartenteachers heads of state plumbers I talkto people that I like I talk to peoplethat I don't like I talked to somepeople that I disagree with deeply on apersonal level but I still have a greatconversation with them so I'd like tospend the next 10 minutes or so teachingyou how to talk and how to listen manyof you have already heard a lot ofadvice on this things like look theperson in the eye think of interestingthings topics to discuss in advancelook nod and smile the show that you'repaying attention repeat back what youjust heard or summarize it so I want youto forget all of that it is crapthere is no reason to learn how to showyou're paying attention if you are infact paying attention now I actually usethe exact same skills as a professionalinterviewer that I do in regular life soI'm going to teach you how to interviewpeople and that's actually going to helpyou learn how to be better conversationslearn to have a conversation withoutwasting your time without getting boredand please God without offending anybodywe've all had really great conversationswe've had them before we know what it'slike the kind of conversation when youwalk away feeling engaged and inspiredor where you feel like you've made areal connection or you've been perfectlyunderstood there is no reason why mostof your interactions can't be like thatso I have 10 basic rules I'm going towalk you through all of them buthonestly if you just choose one of themand master ityou're already enjoy betterconversations number one don't multitaskand I don't mean just set down your cellphone or your tablet or your car keys orwhatever's in your hand I mean bepresent be in that momentdon't be thinking about your argumentyou have with your boss don't bethinking about what you're going to havefor dinner if you want to get out of theconversation get out of the conversationbut don't be half in it and half out ofit number two don't pontificate if youwanted to state your opinion without anyopportunity for response or argument orpushback or gross write a blog nowthere's a really good reason why I don'tallow pundits on my show because they'rereally boring if they are conservativethey're going to hate Obama and foodstamps and abortion if they're a liberalor they're going to hate big banks andoil corporations and Dick Cheney totallypredictable and you don't want to belike that you need to enter everyconversation assuming that you havesomething to learn the famed therapistEmma Scott Peck said that true listeningrequires a setting aside of oneself andsometimes that means setting aside yourpersonal opinion hesaid that sensing this acceptance thespeaker will become less and lessvulnerable and more and more likely toopen up the inner recesses of his or hermind to the listener again assume thatyou have something to learnBill Nye everyone you will ever meetknow something that you don't I put itthis way everybody is an expert insomething number three use open-endedquestions in this case take a cue fromjournalists start your questions withwho what where when why or how if youput in a complicated question you'regoing to get a simple answer out if Iask you were you terrified you're goingto respond to the most powerful word inthat sentence which is terrified and theanswer is yes I was er no I wasn't wereyou angry yes I was very angry let themdescribe it very ones that no try askingthem things like what was that like howdid that feel because then they mighthave to stop for a moment and thinkabout it and you're going to get a muchmore interesting response number four gowith the flow that means thoughts willcome into your mind and you need to letthem go out of your mindwe've heard interviews often in which aguest is talking for several minutes andthen the host comes back in and asked aquestion which seems like it comes outof nowhere or it's already been answeredthat means the host probably stoppedlistening two minutes ago because hethought of this really clever questionand he was just bound and determined tosay that and we do the exact same thingwe're sitting there having aconversation with someone and then weremember that time that we met HughJackman in a coffee shopand we stopped listening stories andideas are going to come to you you needto let them come and let them go numberfive if you don't know say that youdon't know now people on the radioespecially on NPR are much more awarethat they're going on the record and sothey're more careful about what theyclaim to be an expert in and what theyclaim to know for sure do that err onthe side of caution talk should not becheap number six don't equate yourexperience with theirs if they'retalking about having lost a familymemberdon't start talking about the time thatyou lost a family member if you'retalking about the trouble that they'rehaving at work don't tell them about howmuch you hate job it's not the same itis never the same all experiences areindividual and more importantly it isnot about you you don't need to takethat moment to prove how amazing you areor how much you've suffered somebodyasked Stephen Hawking once what his IQwas and he says I have no idea peoplewho brag about their IQs or losersconversations are not a promotionalopportunity number seven try not torepeat yourself it's condescending andit's really boring and we tend to do ita lot especially in work conversationsor in conversations with our kids wehave a point to make so we just keeprephrasing it over and over don't dothatnumber eight stay out of the weedsfrankly people don't care about theyears the names the dates all thosedetails that you're struggling to comeup with in your mind they don't carewhat they care about is you they careabout what you're like what you have incommon so forget the details leave themout number nine this is not the last onebut it is the most important one listenI cannot tell you how many reallyimportant people have said thatlistening is perhaps the most the numberone most important skill that you coulddevelop Buddha said and I'm paraphrasingif your mouth is open you're notlearning and Calvin Coolidge said no manever listened his wayof a job why do we not listen to eachother number one we'd rather talk whatI'm talking I'm in control I don't haveto hear anything I'm not interested inI'm the center of attention I canbolster my own identity but there'sanother reason we get distracted theaverage person talks at about 225 wordsper minute but we can listen at up to500 words per minute so our minds arefilling in those other 275 words andlook I know it takes effort and energyto actually pay attention to someone butif you can't do that you're not in aconversation you're just two peopleshouting out barely related sentences inthe same place you have to you have tolisten to one another Stephen Covey saidit very beautifully he said most of usdon't listen with the intent tounderstand we listen with the intent toreply one more rule and Norton and it'sthis one be briefall of this boils down to the same basicconcept and it is this one be interestedin other people you know I grew up witha very famous grandfather and there waskind of a ritual in my home people wouldcome over to talk to my grandparents andafter they would leave my mother wouldcome home to us and she'd say do youknow who that wasshe was the runner-up to Miss America hewas the mayor of Sacramento she won aPulitzer Prize he is a Russian balletdancer and I started I kind of grew upassuming everyone has some hiddenamazing thing about them and I honestlyI think it's what makes me a better hostI keep my mouth shut as often as Ipossibly can I keep my mind open and I'malways prepared to be amazed and I'mnever disappointed you do the same thinggo out talk to people listen to peopleand most importantly be prepared to beamazed

   "title": "A simple way to break a bad habit | Judson Brewer",
   "publishedAt": "24 Feb 2016",
   "transcription": "when I was first learning to meditatethe instruction was to simply payattention to my breath and when my mindwandered to bring it back sounded simpleenough yet I'd sit on these silentretreats sweating through t-shirts inthe middle of winter I take naps everychance I got because it was really hardwork actually it was exhausting theinstruction was simple enough but I wasmissing something really important sowhy is it so hard to pay attention wellstudies show that even when we're reallytrying to pay attention to somethinglike maybe this talk at some point abouthalf of us will drift off into adaydream or have this urge to check ourTwitter feed so what's going on here itturns out that we're fighting one of themost evolutionarily conserved learningprocesses currently known in science onethat's conserved back to the most basicnervous systems known to man this rewardbased learning process is calledpositive and negative reinforcement andbasically goes like this we see somefood that looks good our brain sayscalories survival we eat the food wetasted it tastes good and especiallywith sugar a body send a signal to ourbrain that says remember what you'reeating and where you found it we laydown this context-dependent memory andlearn to repeat the process next timesee food eat food feel good repeattrigger behavior reward simple rightwell after a while our creative brainsay you know what you can use this formore than just remembering where food isyou know next time you feel bad whydon't you try eating something good soyou'll feel better we think our brainsfor the great idea try this and quicklylearn that if we eat chocolate or icecream when we're mad or sad we feelbettersame process just a different triggerinstead of this hunger signal comingfrom our stomach this emotional signalfeeling sad triggers letters to eatmaybe in our teenage years we were anerd at school and we see those rebelkids outside smoking we think hey I wantto be cool so we start smoking theMarlboro Man wasn't a dork and that wasno accident see cool smoke - be coolfeel good repeat trigger behavior rewardand each time we do this we learn torepeat the process and it becomes ahabitso later feeling stressed out triggersthat urge to smoke a cigarette or to eatsomething sweet now with these samebrain processes we've gone from learningto survive to literally killingourselves with these habits obesity andsmoking are among the elite Aventabecauses of morbidity and mortality inthe world so back to my breath what ifinstead of fighting our brains aretrying to force ourselves to payattention we instead tapped into thisnatural reward based learning processbut added a twist what if instead wejust got really curious about what washappening in our momentary experienceI'll give you an example in my lab westudied whether mindfulness trainingcould help people quit smoking now justlike trying to force myself to payattention on my breath they could try toforce themselves to quit smoking and themajority of them had tried this beforeand failed on average six times now withmarvelous training we dropped a bitabout forcing and instead focused onbeing curious in fact we even told themto smoke what yeah we said go ahead andsmoke just be really curious about whatit's like when you do and what did theynotice well here's an example from oneof our smokers she said mindful smokingsmells like stinky cheese and tasteslike chemicals yuck now she knewcognitively that smoking was bad for herthat's why she joined our program whatshe discovered just by being curiouslyaware when she smoked was that smokingtastes like [ __ ]now she moved from knowledge to wisdomshe moved from knowing in her head thatsmoking was bad for her to knowing it inher bones and this spell of smoking wasbroken she started to becomedisenchanted with her behaviornow the prefrontal cortex that youngestpart of our brain from an evolutionaryperspective it understands on anintellectual level that we shouldn'tsmoke and it tries its hardest to helpus change our behavior to help us stopsmoking to help us stop eating thatsecond that third that fourth cookie wecall this cognitive control we're usingcognition to control our behaviorunfortunately this is also the firstpart of a brain that goes offline whenwe get stressed out which isn't thathelpful now we can all relate to this inour own experience we're much morelikely to do things like yell at ourspouse or kids when we're stressed outor tired even though we know it's notgoing to be helpful we just can't helpourselvesnow when the prefrontal cortex goesoffline and we fall back into our holdhabits which is why this disenchantmentis so important seeing what we get fromour habits helps us understand them in adeeper level to know in our bones so wedon't have to force ourselves to holdback or restrain ourselves from behaviorwe're just less interested in doing itin the first place and this is whatmindfulness is all about seeing reallyclearly what we get when we get caughtup in our behaviors becomingdisenchanted on a visceral level andfrom this disenchanted stance naturallyletting go this isn't to say thatpoof magically we quit smoking but overtime as we learn to see more and moreclearly the results of our actions welet go of old habits and form new onesthe paradox here is that mindfulness isjust about being really interested ingetting close and personal with what'sactually happening in our bodies andminds from moment to moment thiswillingness to turn toward ourexperience rather than trying to makeunpleasant cravings go away as quicklyas possible and this willingness to turntoward our experience is supported bycuriosity which is naturally rewardingwhat does curiosity feel like itfeels good and what happens when we getcurious we start to notice the cravingsare simply made up of body sensationsoh there's tightness there's tensionthere's restlessness and that these bodysensations come and go these arebite-size pieces of experiences that wecan manage from moment to moment ratherthan getting clobbered by this hugescary craving that we choke on in otherwords when we get curious we step out ofour old fear-based reactive habitpatterns and we step into being we'vebecome this inner scientist where we'reeagerly awaiting that next data pointnow this might sound too simplistic toaffect behavior but in one study wefound that mindfulness training wastwice as good as gold standard therapyat helping people quit smoking so itactually works and when we studied thebrains of experienced meditators wefound that parts of a neural network ofDIF self-referential processing calledthe default mode network we're at playnow one current hypothesis is that aregion of this network called theposterior cingulate cortex is activatednot necessarily by craving itself butwhen we get caught up in it when we getsucked in and it takes us for a ride incontrast when we let go step out of theprocess just by being curiously aware ofwhat's happening this same brain regionquiets down now we're testing app andonline based mindfulness trainingprograms that target these coremechanisms and ironically use the sametechnology that's driving us todistraction to help us step out of ourunhealthy habit patterns of smoking ofstress eating and other addictivebehaviors now remember that bit aboutcontext dependent memory we can deliverthese tools to people's fingertips inthe context that matter most so we canhelp them tap into their inherentcapacity to be curiously aware rightwhen that urge to smoke or stress eat orwhatever arises so if you don't smoke orstressy maybe the next time you feelthis urge to check your email whenyou're bored or you're trying todistract yourself from work or maybe tocompulsively respond to that textmessage when you're drivingsee if you can tap into this naturalcapacity just be curiously aware ofwhat's happening in your body in mind inthat moment it will just be anotherchance to perpetuate one of our endlessand exhaustive habit loops or step outof it instead of see text messagecompulsively text back feel a little bitbetternotice the urge get curious feel the joyof letting go and repeat thank you[Applause]",

think most peoplein the country did at the time,filled with a senseof patriotism and retributionand the desire to do something --that, coupled with that factthat I wasn't doing anything.I was 17, just graduatedfrom high school that past summer,living in the back roomof my parents' house paying rent,in the small town I was raised inin Northern Indiana,called Mishawaka.I can spell that laterfor people who are interested --(Laughter)Mishawaka is many good thingsbut cultural hub of the world it is not,so my only exposure to theater and filmwas limited to the playsI did in high schooland

careers.I got as far as Amarillo, Texas,before my car broke down.I spent all my money repairing it,finally made it to Santa Monica --not even LA --stayed for 48 hours wanderingthe beach, basically,got in my car, drove home,thus ending my acting career, so --(Laughter)Seventeen, Mishawaka ...parents' house, paying rent,selling vacuums ...telemarketing,cutting grass at the local4-H fairgrounds.This was my worldgoing into September, 2001.So after the 11th,and feeling an overwhelming sense of duty,and just being pissed offin general -- at myself,my parents, the government;not having confidence,not having a respectable job,my shitty mini-fridge that I justdrove to California and back --I joined the Marine Corps and loved it.I loved being a Marine.It's one of the things I'm most proudof having done in my life.Firing weapons was cool,driving and detonatingexpensive things was great.But I found I lovedthe Marine Corps the mostfor the thing I was lookingfor the least when I joined,which was the people:these weird dudes --a motley crew of charactersfrom a cross sectionof the United States --that on the surface I hadnothing in common with.And over time,all the political and personal bravadothat led me to the military dissolved,and for me, the Marine Corpsbecame synonymous with my friends.And then, a few years into my serviceand months away from deploying to Iraq,I dislocated my sternumin a mountain-biking accident,and had to be medically separated.Those never in the militarymay find this hard to understand,but being told I wasn't getting deployedto Iraq or Afghanistanwas very devastating for me.I have a very clear image of leavingthe base hospital on a stretcherand my entire platoon is waitingoutside to see if I was OK.And then, suddenly,I was a civilian again.I knew I wanted to giveacting another shot,because -- again, this is me --I thought all civilian problemsare small compared to the military.I mean, what can you reallybitch about now, you know?\"It's hot.Someone should turnon the air conditioner.\"\"This coffee line is too long.\"I was a Marine,I knew how to survive.I'd go to New York and become an actor.If things didn't work out,I'd live in Central Parkand dumpster-dive behind Panera Bread.(Laughter)I re-auditioned for Juilliardand this time I was lucky,I got in.But I was surprisedby how complex the transition wasfrom military to civilian.And I was relatively healthy; I can'timagine going through that processon top of a mental or physical injury.But regardless, it was difficult.In part, because I was in acting school --I couldn't justify goingto voice and speech class,throwing imaginary balls of energyat the back of the room,doing acting exerciseswhere I gave birth to myself --(Laughter)while my friends were servingwithout me overseas.But also, because I didn'tknow how to apply the thingsI learned in the militaryto a civilian context.I mean that both practicallyand emotionally.Practically, I had to get a job.And I was an Infantry Marine,where you're shooting machine gunsand firing mortars.There's not a lot of places you canput those skills in the civilian world.(Laughter)Emotionally, I struggled to find meaning.In the military, everything has meaning.Everything you dois either steeped in traditionor has a practical purpose.You can't smoke in the fieldbecause you don't wantto give away your position.You don't touch your face --you have to maintaina personal level of health and hygiene.You face this way when \"Colors\" plays,out of respect for peoplewho went before you.Walk this way, talk this waybecause of this.Your uniform is maintained to the inch.How diligently you followedthose rules spoke volumesabout the kind of Marine you were.Your rank said somethingabout your historyand the respect you had earned.In the civilian world there's no rank.Here you're just another body,and I felt like I constantly hadto prove my worth all over again.And the respect civilians were giving mewhile I was in uniformdidn't exist when I was out of it.There didn't seem to be a ...a sense of community,whereas in the military,I felt this sense of community.How often in the civilian worldare you put in a life-or-death situationwith your closest friendsand they constantly demonstratethat they're not going to abandon you?And meanwhile, at acting school ...(Laughter)I was really, for the first time,discovering playwrightsand characters and playsthat had nothing to do with the military,but were somehow describingmy military experiencein a way that beforeto me was indescribable.And I felt myself becoming less aggressiveas I was able to put wordsto feelings for the first timeand realizing whata valuable tool that was.And when I was reflectingon my time in the military,I wasn't first thinkingon the stereotypical drillsand discipline and pain of it;but rather, the small,intimate human moments,moments of great feeling:friends going AWOLbecause they missed their families,friends getting divorced,grieving together, celebrating together,all within the backdrop of the military.I saw my friends battlingthese circumstances,and I watched the anxietyit produced in them and me,not being able to expressour feelings about it.The military and theater communitiesare actually very similar.You have a group of peopletrying to accomplish a missiongreater than themselves;it's not about you.You have a role, you have to knowyour role within that team.Every team has a leader or director;sometimes they're smart,sometimes they're not.You're forced to be intimatewith complete strangersin a short amount of time;the self-discipline, the self-maintenance.I thought, how great would it beto create a spacethat combined these two seeminglydissimilar communities,that brought entertainmentto a group of peoplethat, considering their occupation,could handle somethinga bit more thought-provokingthan the typical mandatory-fun eventsthat I remember being\"volun-told\" to go to in the military --(Laughter)all well-intended but slightlyoffensive events,like \"Win a Date with a San DiegoChargers Cheerleader,\"where you answer a questionabout pop culture,and if you get it right you win a date,which was a chaperoned walkaround the parade deckwith this already married,pregnant cheerleader --(Laughter)Nothing against cheerleaders,I love cheerleaders.The point is more, how great would itbe to have theater presentedthrough characters that were accessiblewithout being condescending.So we started this nonprofitcalled Arts in the Armed Forces,where we tried to do that,tried to join these two seeminglydissimilar communities.We pick a play or select monologuesfrom contemporary American playsthat are diverse in age and racelike a military audience is,grab a group of incredibletheater-trained actors,arm them with incredible material,keep production valueas minimal as possible --no sets, no costumes,no lights, just reading it --to throw all the emphasis on the languageand to show that theater canbe created at any setting.It's a powerful thing,getting in a room with complete strangersand reminding ourselves of our humanity,and that self-expressionis just as valuable a toolas a rifle on your shoulder.And for an organization like the military,that prides itself on havingacronyms for acronyms,you can get lost in the saucewhen it comes to explaininga collective experience.And I can think of no better communityto arm with a new means of self-expressionthan those protecting our country.We've gone all overthe United States and the world,from Walter Reed in Bethesda, Maryland,to Camp Pendleton,to Camp Arifjan in Kuwait,to USAG Bavaria,on- and off-Broadway theaters in New York.And for the performing artists we bring,it's a window into a culturethey otherwise would nothave had exposure to.And for the military, it's the exact same.And in doing this for the past six years,I'm always remindedthat acting is many things.It's a craft, it's a political act,it's a business, it's --whatever adjectiveis most applicable to you.But it's also a service.I didn't get to finish mine,so whenever I get to be of serviceto this ultimate service industry,the military, for me, again --there's not many things better than that.Thank you.(Applause)We're going to be doing a piecefrom Marco Ramirez,called \"I am not Batman.\"An incredible actorand good friend of mine, Jesse Perez,is going to be reading,and Matt Johnson,who I just met a couple hours ago.They're doing it togetherfor the first time,so we'll see how it goes.Jesse Perez and Matt Johnson.(Applause)Jesse Perez: It's the middle of the nightand the sky is glowinglike mad, radioactive red.And if you squint,you can maybe see the moonthrough a thick layer of cigarette smokeand airplane exhaustthat covers the whole city,like a mosquito netthat won't let the angels in.(Drum beat)And if you look up high enough,you can see me standingon the edge of an 87-story building.And up there, a place for gargoylesand broken clock towersthat have stayed still and deadfor maybe like 100 years,up there is me.(Beat)And I'm frickin' Batman.(Beat)And I gots Batmobiles and batarangsand frickin' bat caves, like, for real.And all it takes is a broom closetor a back room or a fire escape,and Danny's hand-me-down jeans are gone.And my navy blue polo shirt,the one that looks kinda good on mebut has that hole on it near the buttfrom when it got snaggedon the chain-link fence behind Arturo'sbut it isn't even a big dealbecause I tuck that part inand it's, like, all good.That blue polo shirt -- it's gone, too!And I get like, like ... transformational.(Beat)And nobody pulls out a beltand whips Batman for talkin' back.(Beat)Or for not talkin' back.And nobody calls Batman simpleor stupidor skinny.And nobody fires Batman's brotherfrom the Eastern Taxi Company'cause they was making cutbacks, neither.'Cause they got nothing but respect.And not like afraid-respect,just, like, respect-respect.(Laughter)'Cause nobody's afraid of you.'Cause Batman doesn't mean nobody no harm.(Beat)Ever.(Double beat)'Cause all Batman really wantsto do is save peopleand maybe pay abuela's bills one dayand die happy.And maybe get, like, mad-famous for real.(Laughter)Oh -- and kill the Joker.(Drum roll)Tonight, like most nights, I'm all alone.And I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'like a eagleor like a --no, yeah, like a eagle.(Laughter)And my cape is flapping in the windcause it's frickin' longand my pointy ears are on,and that mask that covers like halfmy face is on, too,and I got, like, bulletproof stuffall in my chest so no one can hurt me.And nobody -- nobody! --is gonna come between Batman ...and justice.(Drums)(Laughter)From where I am,I can hear everything.(Silence)Somewhere in the city,there's a old lady pickingStyrofoam leftovers up out of a trash canand she's putting a pieceof sesame chicken someone spit outinto her own mouth.And somewhere there's a doctorwith a wack haircut in a black lab coattrying to find a cure for the diseasesthat are gonna make usall extinct for real one day.And somewhere there's a man,a man in a janitor's uniform,stumbling home drunk and dizzyafter spending half his paycheckon 40-ounce bottles of twist-off beer,and the other half on a four-hour visitto some lady's houseon a street where the lightshave all been shot outby people who'd rather dowhat they do in this city in the dark.And half a block away from janitor man,there's a group of good-for-nothingswho don't know no better,waiting for janitor manwith rusted bicycle chainsand imitation Louisville Sluggers,and if they don't find a cent on him,which they won't,they'll just pound at him till the musclesin their arms start burning,till there's no more teeth to crack out.But they don't count on me.They don't count on no Dark Knight,with a stomach full of grocery-storebrand macaroni and cheeseand cut-up Vienna sausages.(Laughter)'Cause they'd rather believeI don't exist.And from 87 stories up, I can hearone of the good-for-nothings say,\"Gimme the cash!\" -- real fast like that,just, \"Gimme me the fuckin' cash!\"And I see janitor man mumble somethingin drunk language and turn pale,and from 87 stories up,I can hear his stomach tryingto hurl its way out his Dickies.So I swoop down, like, mad-fastand I'm like darkness, I'm like, \"Swoosh!\"And I throw a batarangat the one naked lightbulb.(Cymbal)And they're all like, \"Whoa, muthafucker!Who just turned out the lights?\"(Laughter)\"What's that over there?\"\"What?\"\"Gimme me what you got, old man!\"\"Did anybody hear that?\"\"Hear what? There ain't nothing.No, really -- there ain't no bat!\"But then ...one out of the three good-for-nothingsgets it to the head -- pow!And number two swings blindlyinto the dark cape before him,but before his fist hits anything,I grab a trash can lid and --right in the gut!And number one comesback with the jump kick,but I know judo karate, too,so I'm like --(Drums)Twice!(Drums)(Laughter)(Drums)But before I can do any more damage,suddenly we all hear a \"click-click.\"And suddenly everything gets quiet.And the one good-for-nothing left standinggrips a handgun and aims it straight up,like he's holding Jesus hostage,like he's threatening maybeto blow a hole in the moon.And the good-for-nothingwho got it to the head,who tried to jump-kick me,and the other good-for-nothingwho got it in the gut,is both scrambling back awayfrom the dark figure before 'em.And the drunk man, the janitor man,is huddled in a corner,praying to Saint Anthony'cause that's the only onehe could remember.(Double beat)And there's me:eyes glowing white,cape blowing softly in the wind.(Beat)Bulletproof chest heaving,my heart beating right through itin a Morse code for:\"Fuck with mejust oncecome onjust try.\"And the one good-for-nothingleft standing,the one with the handgun --yeah, he laughs.And he lowers his arm.And he points it at meand gives the moon a break.And he aims it rightbetween my pointy ears,like goal posts and he's special teams.And janitor man is stillcalling Saint Anthony,but he ain't pickin' up.And for a second,it seems like ...maybe I'm gonna lose.Nah!(Drums)Shoot! Shoot! Fwa-ka-ka!\"Don't kill me, man!\"Snap! Wrist crack! Neck! Slash!Skin meets acid:\"Ahhhhhhh!\"And he's on the floorand I'm standing over himand I got the gun in my hands nowand I hate guns, I hate holding 'em'cause I'm Batman.And, asterisk:Batman don't like guns 'cause his parentsgot iced by guns a long time ago.But for just a second,my eyes glow white,and I hold this thingfor I could speak to the good-for-nothingin a language he maybe understands.Click-click!(Beat)And the good-for-nothingsbecome good-for-disappearinginto whatever toxic waste, chemicalsludge shithole they crawled out of.And it's just me and janitor man.And I pick him up,and I wipe sweat and cheap perfumeoff his forehead.And he begs me not to hurt himand I grab him tightby his janitor-man shirt collar,and I pull him to my faceand he's taller than mebut the cape helps,so he listens when I look himstraight in the eyes.And I say two words to him:\"Go home.\"And he does,checking behind his shoulderevery 10 feet.And I swoosh from buildingto building on his way there'cause I know where he lives.And I watch his hands trembleas he pulls out his key chainand opens the door to his building.And I'm back in bedbefore he even walks inthrough the front door.And I hear him turn on the faucetand pour himself a glassof warm tap water.And he puts the glass back in the sink.And I hear his footsteps.And they get sloweras they get to my room.And he creaks my door open,like, mad-slow.And he takes a step in,which he never does.(Beat)And he's staring off into nowhere,his face, the colorof sidewalks in summer.And I act like I'm just waking upand I say, \"Ah, what's up, Pop?\"And janitor man says nothing to me.But I see in the dark,I see his arms go limpand his head turns back, like, towards me.And he lifts it for I can see his face,for I could see his eyes.And his cheeks is drippin',but not with sweat.And he just stands there breathing,like he remembers my eyes glowing white,like he remembers my bulletproof chest,like he remembers he's my pop.And for a long time I don't say nothin'.And he turns around, hand on the doorknob.And he ain't looking my way,but I hear him mumble two words to me:\"I'm sorry.\"And I lean over, and I openmy window just a crack.If you look up high enough,you could see me.And from where I am --(Cymbals)I could hear everything.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)",

   "title": "Rethinking infidelity ... a talk for anyone who has ever loved | Esther Perel",
   "publishedAt": "21 May 2015",
   "transcription": "Why do we cheat?And why do happy people cheat?And when we say \"infidelity,\"what exactly do we mean?Is it a hookup, a love story,paid sex, a chat room,a massage with a happy ending?Why do we think that men cheatout of boredom and fear of intimacy,but women cheat out of lonelinessand hunger for intimacy?And is an affair alwaysthe end of a relationship?For the past 10 years,I have traveled the globeand worked extensivelywith hundreds of coupleswho have been shattered by infidelity.There is one simple act of transgressionthat can rob a coupleof their relationship,their happiness and theirvery identity: an affair.And yet, this extremely commonact is so poorly understood.So this talk is for anyonewho has ever loved.Adultery has existedsince marriage was invented,and so, too, the taboo against it.In fact, infidelity has a tenacitythat marriage can only envy,so much so, that this isthe only commandmentthat is repeated twice in the Bible:once for doing it, and oncejust for thinking about it.(Laughter)So how do we reconcilewhat is universally forbidden,yet universally practiced?Now, throughout history, menpractically had a license to cheatwith little consequence,and supported by a hostof biological and evolutionary theoriesthat justified their need to roam,so the double standardis as old as adultery itself.But who knows what's really going onunder the sheets there, right?Because when it comes to sex,the pressure for menis to boast and to exaggerate,but the pressure for womenis to hide, minimize and deny,which isn't surprising when you considerthat there are still nine countrieswhere women can be killed for straying.Now, monogamy used to beone person for life.Today, monogamy is one person at a time.(Laughter)(Applause)I mean, many of you probably have said,\"I am monogamous in all my relationships.\"(Laughter)We used to marry,and had sex for the first time.But now we marry,and we stop having sex with others.The fact is that monogamyhad nothing to do with love.Men relied on women's fidelityin order to know whose children these are,and who gets the cows when I die.Now, everyone wants to knowwhat percentage of people cheat.I've been asked that questionsince I arrived at this conference.(Laughter)It applies to you.But the definition of infidelitykeeps on expanding:sexting, watching porn, stayingsecretly active on dating apps.So because there is nouniversally agreed-upon definitionof what even constitutes an infidelity,estimates vary widely,from 26 percent to 75 percent.But on top of it, we arewalking contradictions.So 95 percent of us will saythat it is terribly wrongfor our partner to lieabout having an affair,but just about the sameamount of us will saythat that's exactly what wewould do if we were having one.(Laughter)Now, I like this definitionof an affair --it brings together the three key elements:a secretive relationship,which is the core structure of an affair;an emotional connectionto one degree or another;and a sexual alchemy.And alchemy is the key word here,because the erotic frisson is such thatthe kiss that you only imagine giving,can be as powerful and as enchantingas hours of actual lovemaking.As Marcel Proust said,it's our imagination that is responsiblefor love, not the other person.So it's never been easier to cheat,and it's never been moredifficult to keep a secret.And never has infidelity exactedsuch a psychological toll.When marriage was an economic enterprise,infidelity threatenedour economic security.But now that marriageis a romantic arrangement,infidelity threatensour emotional security.Ironically, we used to turn to adultery --that was the space wherewe sought pure love.But now that we seek love in marriage,adultery destroys it.Now, there are three ways that I thinkinfidelity hurts differently today.We have a romantic idealin which we turn to one personto fulfill an endless list of needs:to be my greatest lover, my best friend,the best parent, my trusted confidant,my emotional companion,my intellectual equal.And I am it: I'm chosen, I'm unique,I'm indispensable, I'm irreplaceable,I'm the one.And infidelity tells me I'm not.It is the ultimate betrayal.Infidelity shattersthe grand ambition of love.But if throughout history,infidelity has always been painful,today it is often traumatic,because it threatens our sense of self.So my patient Fernando, he's plagued.He goes on: \"I thought I knew my life.I thought I knew who you were,who we were as a couple, who I was.Now, I question everything.\"Infidelity -- a violation of trust,a crisis of identity.\"Can I ever trust you again?\" he asks.\"Can I ever trust anyone again?\"And this is also what my patientHeather is telling me,when she's talking to meabout her story with Nick.Married, two kids.Nick just left on a business trip,and Heather is playingon his iPad with the boys,when she sees a messageappear on the screen:\"Can't wait to see you.\"Strange, she thinks,we just saw each other.And then another message:\"Can't wait to hold you in my arms.\"And Heather realizesthese are not for her.She also tells methat her father had affairs,but her mother, she foundone little receipt in the pocket,and a little bit of lipstickon the collar.Heather, she goes digging,and she finds hundreds of messages,and photos exchangedand desires expressed.The vivid detailsof Nick's two-year affairunfold in front of her in real time,And it made me think:Affairs in the digital ageare death by a thousand cuts.But then we have another paradoxthat we're dealing with these days.Because of this romantic ideal,we are relying on our partner'sfidelity with a unique fervor.But we also have neverbeen more inclined to stray,and not because we have new desires today,but because we live in an erawhere we feel that we areentitled to pursue our desires,because this is the culturewhere I deserve to be happy.And if we used to divorcebecause we were unhappy,today we divorcebecause we could be happier.And if divorce carried all the shame,today, choosing to stay when you can leaveis the new shame.So Heather, she can't talk to her friendsbecause she's afraid that theywill judge her for still loving Nick,and everywhere she turns,she gets the same advice:Leave him. Throw the dog on the curb.And if the situation were reversed,Nick would be in the same situation.Staying is the new shame.So if we can divorce,why do we still have affairs?Now, the typical assumptionis that if someone cheats,either there's something wrongin your relationship or wrong with you.But millions of peoplecan't all be pathological.The logic goes like this: If youhave everything you need at home,then there is no needto go looking elsewhere,assuming that there is sucha thing as a perfect marriagethat will inoculate us against wanderlust.But what if passionhas a finite shelf life?What if there are thingsthat even a good relationshipcan never provide?If even happy people cheat,what is it about?The vast majority of peoplethat I actually work withare not at all chronic philanderers.They are often people who aredeeply monogamous in their beliefs,and at least for their partner.But they find themselves in a conflictbetween their values and their behavior.They often are people who haveactually been faithful for decades,but one day they cross a linethat they never thought they would cross,and at the risk of losing everything.But for a glimmer of what?Affairs are an act of betrayal,and they are also an expressionof longing and loss.At the heart of an affair,you will often finda longing and a yearningfor an emotional connection,for novelty, for freedom,for autonomy, for sexual intensity,a wish to recapturelost parts of ourselvesor an attempt to bring backvitality in the face of loss and tragedy.I'm thinking aboutanother patient of mine, Priya,who is blissfully married,loves her husband,and would never want to hurt the man.But she also tells methat she's always donewhat was expected of her:good girl, good wife, good mother,taking care of her immigrant parents.Priya, she fell for the arboristwho removed the tree from her yardafter Hurricane Sandy.And with his truck and his tattoos,he's quite the opposite of her.But at 47, Priya's affair is aboutthe adolescence that she never had.And her story highlights for methat when we seek the gaze of another,it isn't always our partnerthat we are turning away from,but the person thatwe have ourselves become.And it isn't so much that we'relooking for another person,as much as we arelooking for another self.Now, all over the world,there is one word that peoplewho have affairs always tell me.They feel alive.And they often will tell mestories of recent losses --of a parent who died,and a friend that went too soon,and bad news at the doctor.Death and mortality often livein the shadow of an affair,because they raise these questions.Is this it? Is there more?Am I going on for another25 years like this?Will I ever feel that thing again?And it has led me to thinkthat perhaps these questionsare the ones that propelpeople to cross the line,and that some affairs arean attempt to beat back deadness,in an antidote to death.And contrary to what you may think,affairs are way less about sex,and a lot more about desire:desire for attention,desire to feel special,desire to feel important.And the very structure of an affair,the fact that you cannever have your lover,keeps you wanting.That in itself is a desire machine,because the incompleteness, the ambiguity,keeps you wantingthat which you can't have.Now some of you probably thinkthat affairs don't happenin open relationships,but they do.First of all, the conversationabout monogamy is not the sameas the conversation about infidelity.But the fact is that it seemsthat even when we havethe freedom to have other sexual partners,we still seem to be luredby the power of the forbidden,that if we do that whichwe are not supposed to do,then we feel like we are reallydoing what we want to.And I've also toldquite a few of my patientsthat if they could bringinto their relationshipsone tenth of the boldness,the imagination and the vervethat they put into their affairs,they probably would never need to see me.(Laughter)So how do we heal from an affair?Desire runs deep.Betrayal runs deep.But it can be healed.And some affairs are death knellsfor relationships that werealready dying on the vine.But others will jolt usinto new possibilities.The fact is, the majority of coupleswho have experiencedaffairs stay together.But some of them will merely survive,and others will actually be ableto turn a crisis into an opportunity.They'll be able to turn thisinto a generative experience.And I'm actually thinking evenmore so for the deceived partner,who will often say,\"You think I didn't want more?But I'm not the one who did it.\"But now that the affair is exposed,they, too, get to claim more,and they no longer haveto uphold the status quothat may not have been workingfor them that well, either.I've noticed that a lot of couples,in the immediate aftermath of an affair,because of this new disorderthat may actually lead to a new order,will have depths of conversationswith honesty and opennessthat they haven't had in decades.And, partners who weresexually indifferentfind themselves suddenlyso lustfully voracious,they don't know where it's coming from.Something about the fearof loss will rekindle desire,and make way for an entirelynew kind of truth.So when an affair is exposed,what are some of the specific thingsthat couples can do?We know from trauma that healing beginswhen the perpetratoracknowledges their wrongdoing.So for the partner who had the affair,for Nick,one thing is to end the affair,but the other is the essential,important act of expressingguilt and remorse for hurting his wife.But the truth isthat I have noticed that quite a lotof people who have affairsmay feel terribly guiltyfor hurting their partner,but they don't feel guiltyfor the experience of the affair itself.And that distinction is important.And Nick, he needs to holdvigil for the relationship.He needs to become, for a while,the protector of the boundaries.It's his responsibility to bring it up,because if he thinks about it,he can relieve Heather from the obsession,and from having to make surethat the affair isn't forgotten,and that in itselfbegins to restore trust.But for Heather,or deceived partners,it is essential to do thingsthat bring back a sense of self-worth,to surround oneself with loveand with friends and activitiesthat give back joyand meaning and identity.But even more important,is to curb the curiosityto mine for the sordid details --Where were you? Where did you do it?How often? Is she betterthan me in bed? --questions that only inflict more pain,and keep you awake at night.And instead, switch to what I callthe investigative questions,the ones that minethe meaning and the motives --What did this affair mean for you?What were you able to expressor experience therethat you could no longer do with me?What was it like for youwhen you came home?What is it about us that you value?Are you pleased this is over?Every affair will redefine a relationship,and every couple will determinewhat the legacy of the affair will be.But affairs are here to stay,and they're not going away.And the dilemmas of love and desire,they don't yield just simple answersof black and white and good and bad,and victim and perpetrator.Betrayal in a relationshipcomes in many forms.There are many waysthat we betray our partner:with contempt, with neglect,with indifference, with violence.Sexual betrayal is onlyone way to hurt a partner.In other words, the victim of an affairis not always the victim of the marriage.Now, you've listened to me,and I know what you're thinking:She has a French accent,she must be pro-affair.(Laughter)So, you're wrong.I am not French.(Laughter)(Applause)And I'm not pro-affair.But because I think that goodcan come out of an affair,I have often been askedthis very strange question:Would I ever recommend it?Now, I would no morerecommend you have an affairthan I would recommend you have cancer,and yet we know that peoplewho have been illoften talk about how their illnesshas yielded them a new perspective.The main question that I've been askedsince I arrived at this conferencewhen I said I would talkabout infidelity is, for or against?I said, \"Yes.\"(Laughter)I look at affairs from a dual perspective:hurt and betrayal on one side,growth and self-discovery on the other --what it did to you,and what it meant for me.And so when a couple comes to mein the aftermath of an affairthat has been revealed,I will often tell them this:Today in the West,most of us are going to havetwo or three relationshipsor marriages,and some of us are goingto do it with the same person.Your first marriage is over.Would you like to createa second one together?Thank you.(Applause)",

andinjuries that took placethere's no way to quantify thepsychological damage of those who are inthe school or who took part in rescue orcleanup effortsthere's no way to assess the magnitudeof a tragedy like Columbine especiallywhen it can be a blueprint for othershooters who go on to commit atrocitiesof their own Columbine was a tidal waveand when the crash ended it would takeyears for the community and for societyto comprehend its impact it has taken meyears to try to accept my son's legacythe cruel behavior that defined the endof his life showed me that he was acompletely different person from the oneI knew afterwards people asked how couldyou not know what kind of a mother wereyou I still ask myself those samequestions before the shootings I thoughtof myself as a good mom helping mychildren become caring healthyresponsible adults was the mostimportant role in my lifebut the tragedy convinced me that Ifailed as a parentand it's partially the sense of failurethat brings me here todayaside from his father I was the oneperson who knew and loved Dylan the mostif anyone could have known what washappening it should have been me rightbut I didn't know today I'm here toshare the experience of what it's liketo be the mother of someone who killsand hurts for years after the tragedy Icomb through memories trying to figureout exactly where I failed as a parentbut there are no simple answers I can'tgive you any solutions all I can do isshare what I have learned when I talk topeople who didn't know me before theshootings I have three challenges tomeet first when I walk into a room likethis I never know if someone there hasexperienced loss because of what my sondid I feel a need to acknowledge thesuffering caused by a member of myfamily who wasn't here to do it forhimselfso first with all of my heart I'm sorryif my son has caused you pain the secondchallenge I have is that I must ask forunderstanding and even compassion when Italk about my son's death as a suicidetwo years before he died he wrote on apiece of paper in a notebook that he wascutting himself he said that he was inagony and wanted to get a gun so hecould end his life I didn't know aboutany of this until months after his deathwhen I talked about his death as asuicide I'm not trying to downplay theviciousness he showed at the end of hislife I'm trying to understand how hissuicidal thinking led to murder after alot of reading and talking with expertsI've come to believe that hisinvolvement in the shootings was rootednot in his desire tobut in this desire to die the thirdchallenge I have when I talk about myson's murder-suicide is that I'm talkingabout mental health excuse me is thatI'm talking about mental health or brainhealth as I prefer to call it becauseit's more concrete and in the samebreath I'm talking about violence thelast thing I want to do was tocontribute to the misunderstanding thatalready exists around mental illnessonly a very small percent of those whohave a mental illness are violent towardother people but of those who die bysuicide it's estimated that about 75 tomaybe more than 90% have a diagnosis ofa mental health condition of some kindas you all know very well our mentalhealth care system is not equipped tohelp everyone and not everyone withdestructive thoughts fits the criteriafor a specific diagnosis many who haveongoing feelings of fear or anger orhopelessness are never assessed ortreated too often they get our attentiononly if they reach a behavioral crisisif estimates are correct that about oneto two percent of all suicides involvesthe murder of another person whensuicide rates rise as they are risingfor some populations then murder suiciderates will rise as well I wanted tounderstand what was going on in Dylan'smind prior to his death so I look foranswers from other survivors of suicideloss I did research and volunteered tohelp with fundraising events andwhenever I could I talked with those whohad survived their own suicidal crisisor attempt one of the most helpfulconversations I had was with a co-workerwho overheard me talking to someone elsein my office cubicle she heard me saythat Dylan could not have loved me if hecould do something that's horroras he did later when she found me aloneshe apologized for overhearing thatconversation but told me that I waswrong she said that when she was a youngsingle mother with three small childrenshe became severely depressed and washospitalized to keep her safe at thetime she was certain that her childrenwould be better off if she died so shehad made a plan to end her life sheassured me that a mother's love was thestrongest bond on earth and that sheloved her children more than anything inthe world but because of her illness shewas sure that they would be better offwithout her what she said and what I'velearned from others is that we do notmake the so-called decision or choice todie by suicide in the same way that wechoose what car to drive or where to goon a Saturday night when someone is inan extremely suicidal state they are ina stage for medical health emergencyyou're thinking is impaired and they'velost access to tools of self-governanceeven though they can make a plan and askthis logic their sense of truth isdistorted by a filter of pain throughwhich they interpret their reality somepeople can be very good at hiding thisstate and they often have good reasonsfor doing that many of us have suicidalthoughts at some point but persistentongoing thoughts of suicide and devisinga means to die our symptoms of pathologyand like many illnesses the conditionhas to be recognized and treated beforea life is lost but my son's death wasnot purely a suicide it involves massmurder I wanted to know how his suicidalthinking became homicidal but researchis sparse and there are no simpleanswers yes he probably had ongoingdepressionhe had a personality that wasperfectionistic and self-reliant andthat made him less likely to seek helpfrom others he had experience triggeringevents at the school that left himfeeling debased and humiliated and madand he had a complicated friendship witha boy who shared his feelings of rageand alienation and who was seriouslydisturbed controlling and homicidal andon top of this period in his life ofextreme vulnerability and fragilityDylan found access to guns even thoughwe'd never owned any in our home it wasappallingly easy for a 17 year old boyto buy guns both legally and illegallywithout my permission or knowledge andsomehow 17 years in many schoolshootings later it's still appallinglyeasy what Dylan did that day broke myheart and as trauma so often does ittook a toll on my body and on my mindtwo years after the shootings I gotbreast cancer and two years after that Ibegan to have mental health problems ontop of the constant perpetual grief Iwas terrified but I would run into afamily member of someone Dylan hadkilled or be accosted by depressed or byan angry citizen I was afraid to turn onthe news afraid to hear myself beingcalled a terrible parent or a disgustingperson I started having a panic attackthe first bout started four years afterthe shootings when I was getting readyfor the depositions and would have tomeet the victims families face to facethe second round started six years afterthe shootings when I was preparing tospeak publicly aboutsuicide for the first time at aconference both episodes lasted severalweeks the attacks happened everywhere inthe hardware store in my office or evenwhile reading a book in bed my mindwould suddenly lock into the same cycleof terror and no matter how hard I triedto calm myself down or reason my way outof it I couldn't do it it felt as if mybrain was trying to kill me and thenbeing afraid of being afraidconsumed all of my thoughts that's whenI learned firsthand what it feels liketo have a malfunctioning mind and that'swhen I truly became a brain healthadvocate with therapy and medication andself-care life eventually returned towhatever could be thought of as normalunder the circumstances when I look backon all that had happened I could seethat my son's spiral into dysfunctionprobably occurred over a period of abouttwo years plenty of time to get him helpif only someone had known that he neededhelp and known what to do every timesomeone asks me how could you not haveknown it feels like a punch in the gutit carries accusations and taps into myfeelings of guilt that no matter howmuch therapy I've had I will never fullyeradicate but here's something I'velearned if love were enough to stopsomeone who was suicidal from hurtingthemselves suicides would hardly everhappen but love is not enough andsuicide is prevalent it's the secondleading cause of death for people aged10 to 34 and 15 percent of Americanyouths report having made a suicide planin the last yearI've learned that no matter how much wewant to believe we can we cannot knowour control everything our loved onesthink and feel and the stubborn beliefthat we are somehow different thatsomeone we love would never think ofhurting themselves or someone else cancause us to miss what's hidden in plainsightand if worst-case scenarios do come topasswe'll have to learn to forgive ourselvesfor not knowing for not asking the rightquestionsare not finding the right treatment weshould always assume that someone welove may be suffering regardless of whatthey say or how they act we shouldlisten with our whole being withoutjudgment and without offering solutionsI know that I will live with thistragedy with these multiple tragediesfor the rest of my life I know that inthe minds of many what I lost can'tcompare to what the other families lostI know my struggle doesn't make there'sany easier I know there are even somewho think I don't have the right to anypain but only to a life of permanentpenance in the end what I know comesdown to this the tragic fact is thateven the most vigilant and responsibleof us may not be able to help but forlove sakes we must never stop trying toknow the unknowable thank you",

   "transcription": "what's the scariest thing you've everdone or another way to say it is what'sthe most dangerous thing that you'veever done and why did you do it I knowwhat the most dangerous thing is thatI've ever done because NASA does themath you look back to the first fiveshuttle launches the odds of acatastrophic event during the first fiveshuttle launches was one in nine andeven when I first flew on the shuttleback in a 1995 74 shuttle flight theodds were still now that we look backabout one in 38 or so 135 one in 40 notgreat odds so it's a really interestingday when you wake up at the KennedySpace Center and you're gonna go tospace that day because you realize bythe end of the day you're either goingto be floating effortlessly gloriouslyin space or you'll be dead you go intoat the Kennedy Space Center into the thesuit up room the same room that that ourchildhood heroes got dressed in thatNeil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin gotsuited in to go ride the Apollo rocketto the moon and I got my pressure suitbuilt around me and rode down outside inthe van heading out to the launch pad inthe Astro van heading out in the launchpad and as you come around the corner atthe Kennedy Space Centerit's normally pre-dawn and in thedistance lit up by the the huge xenonlights is your spaceship the vehiclethat is going to take you off the planetand the crew is is sitting in the Astrovan sort of hushed almost holding handslooking at that as it gets bigger andbigger we ride the elevator up and wecrawl in on your hands and knees intothe spaceship one at a time and you sortof worm your way up into your chair andplunk yourself downon your back and the hatch is closed andsuddenly what has been a lifetime ofboth dreams and denial is becoming realsomething that I dreamed about fact thatI chose to do when I was nine years oldis now suddenly within not too manyminutes of actually happening and in theastronaut business the shuttle is a verycomplicated vehicle it's the mostcomplicated flying machine ever builtand in the astronaut business we have asaying which is there is no problem sobad that you can't make it worse and andso you're very conscious in the cockpityou're thinking about all of the thingsthat you might have to do all theswitches and all the wickets you have togo through and as the time gets closerand closer this excitement is buildingand then about three and a half minutesbefore launch the huge nozzles on theback like the size of big church bellsswing back and forth and the mass inthem is such that it sways the wholevehicle like like the vehicles aliveunderneath you like like an elephantgetting up lots of up its knees orsomething and then about 30 secondsbefore launch the vehicle is completelyalive it is ready to go the AP users arerunning the computers are allself-contained it's ready to leave theplanet and 15 seconds before launch thishappens[Music]start two one ignitionit is incredibly powerful to be onboardone of these things you are in the gripof something that is vastly morepowerful than yourself it's shaking youso hard you can't focus on theinstruments in front of you it's likeyou're in the jaws of some enormous dogand there's a foot and the small of yourback pushing you to space acceleratingwildly straight up shouldering your waythrough the air and you're in a verycomplex place paying attention watchingthe vehicle go through each one of itswickets with a steadily increasing smileon your face after two minutes thosesolid rockets explode off and then youjust have the liquid engines thehydrogen and oxygen and it's as ifyou're in a dragster with your foot tothe floor and accelerating like you'venever accelerate you get lighter andlighter the force gets on us heavier andheavier and it feels like like someone'spouring cement on you or something untilfinally after about eight minutes and 40seconds or so we are finally at exactlythe right altitude exactly the rightspeed the right direction the enginesshut off and we're weightless and we'realive it's an amazing experience but whywould we take that risk why would you dosomething that dangerous you know mycase the answer is fairlystraightforward I was inspired as ayoungster that this is what I wanted todo I watched the first people walk onthe moon and to me it was just anobvious thing I want to somehow turnmyself into that but the real questionis how do you deal with the danger of itand the fear that comes from it how doyou deal with fear versus danger andhaving the goal in mind thinking aboutwhere it might lead directed me to thelife of looking at all of the the smalldetails to allow this to become possibleto be able to launch and go help build aspace station where you are onboard amillion-pound creation that's goingaround the world at five miles a secondeight kilometers a second around theworldsixteen times a day with experiments onboard that are teaching us what thesubstance of the universe is made of andrunning 200 experiments inside but maybeeven more importantallowing us to see the world in a waythat is impossible through any othermeans to be able to look down and haveif your jaw could drop it would thejaw-dropping gorgeousness of the theturning orb like a like a self-propelledart gallery of fantastic constantlychanging beauty that is the world itselfand you see because of the speed asunrise or a sunset every 45 minutes forhalf a year and the most magnificentpart of all that is to go outside on aspacewalk you are you know one personspaceship that is your spacesuit andyou're going through space with theworld it's an entirely differentperspective you're not looking up at theuniverse you and the earth are goingthrough the universe together and you'reholding on with one hand looking at theworld turn beside you it's it's it'slike roaring silently with color andtextures it pours by just mesmerizinglynext to you and if you can tear youreyes away from that and you look underyour arm down at the rest of everythingit's it's a unfathomable blackness likewith a touch texture you feel like youcould stick your hand into and you areholding on with one hand one link to theother seven billion people and I wasoutside of my first space walk when myleft eye went blind and I didn't knowwhy suddenly my left eye slammed shutand great pain and I couldn't figure outwhat why my I wasn't working I wasthinking what do I do nextI thought well maybe that's why we havetwo eyes so I kept workingbut unfortunately without gravity tearsdon't fall and so you just get a biggerand bigger ball of whatever that ismixed with your tears on your eye untileventually the ball becomes so big thatthe surface tension takes it across thebridge of your nose like a tiny littlewaterfall and goes goosh into your othereye and now I was completely blindoutside the spaceshipso what's the scariest thing you've everdone maybe it's spiders a lot of peopleare afraid of spiders I think you shouldbe afraid of spiders spiders are creepyand they got long hairy legs and spiderslike this one the brown recluse I meanit's horrible if a brown recluse bitesyou you're not one of these horrible bignecrotic things on your leg and theremight be one right now sitting on thechair behind you in fact and how do youknow and so a spider lands on you andyou go through this great spasm IIattack because spiders are scary butthen you could say well is there a brownrecluse sitting on the chair beside meor not I don't know are there brownrecluses here so if you actually do theresearch you find out that in the worldthere about 50,000 different types ofspiders and there are about two dozenthat are venomous out of 50,000 and ifyou're in Canada because of the coldwinters here in BC there's about sevenhundred and twenty seven hundred andthirty different types of spiders andthere's one one that is venomous andit's venom isn't even fatal it's justkind of like a nasty sting and thatspider not only that but that spider hasbeautiful markings on it it's like I'mdangerous I got a big radiation symbolon my back it's the black glowso if you're even slightly careful youcan avoid running into the one spiderthat and it lives close to the groundyou're walking along you are never gonnago through a spiderweb or a black widowbites you spider webs like this itdoesn't build those it builds them downin the corners and it's from Black Widowbecause it's the female spider eats themale it doesn't care about you so infact the next time you walk into aspiderweb you don't need to panic and gowith your caveman reaction the danger isentirely different than the fear and howdo you get around it though how do youchange your behavior well next time yousee a spider web have a good look makesure it's not a black widow spider andthen walk into it and then you seeanother spider web and walk into thatone it's just a little bit of fluffystuff it's not a big deal and the spiderthat may come out is no more threat toyou than a ladybug or a butterfly andthen I guarantee you if you walk througha hundred spider websyou will have changed your fundamentalhuman behavior your caveman reaction andyou will now be able to walkthe park in the morning and not worryabout that spiderweb or we're into yourgrandma's attic or whatever into yourown basement and you can apply this toanything if you're outside on aspacewalk and you're blinded yournatural reaction would be to panic Ithink it would make you nervous andworried but we had considered all thevenom and we had practiced with a wholevariety of different spider webs we kneweverything there is to know about thespacesuit and we trained underwaterthousands of times and we don't justpractice things going right we practicethings going wrong all the time so thatyou are constantly walking through thosespider webs and not just underwater butalso in virtual reality labs with thehelmet and the gloves so you feel likeit's realistic so when you finallyactually get outside on a spacewalk itfeels much different than it would ifyou just went out first time and even ifyou're blinded your natural panickyreaction doesn't happen instead you kindof look around and go okay I can't seebut I can hear I can talk ScottParazynski is out here with me he couldcome over and help me we actuallypracticed incapacitated crew rescue sohe could float me like a blimp and stuffme into the airlock if we had to I couldfind my own way back it's not nearly asbig a deal and actually if you keep oncrying for a while whatever that guckwas that's in your eyes starts to diluteyou can start to see again and houstonif you negotiate with them they will letyou then keep working and we finishedeverything on this spacewalk and when wecame back inside Jeff got some cottonbaton and took the crusty stuff aroundmy eyes and it turned out it was justthe anti-fog sort of a mixture of oiland soap that got in my eye and now weuse Johnson's no more tears which weprobably should have been using rightfrom the very beginning but but the keyto that is by looking at the differencebetween perceived danger and actualdanger where's the real risk what is thereal thing that you should be afraid ofnot just a generic fear of bad thingshappening you can fundamentally changeyour reaction to things so that itallows you to go places and see thingsand do things that otherwise would becompletely denied to you where you cansee that the hard pant south of theSahara or you can see New York City in away that is almost dreamlike or theunconscious gingham of Eastern Europefields or the Great Lakes as acollection of small puddles you can seethe fault lines of San Francisco and theway the water pours out under the bridgejust entirely different than any otherway that you could have if you had notfound a way to conquer your fear you seea beauty that otherwise never would havehappened it's time to come home at theend this is our spaceship the Soyuz thatlittle 1/3 of us climb in and then thisspaceship detaches from the station andfalls into the atmosphere these twoparts here actually melt we jettison andthey burn up in the atmosphere the onlypart that survives is the little bulletthat we're riding in and it falls intothe atmosphere and in a senescence youare riding a meteorite home and ridingmeteorites is scary and it ought to bebut instead of riding into theatmosphere just screaming like you wouldif suddenly you found yourself riding ameteorite back to earth instead twentyyears previously we had started studyingRussian and then once you learnedRussian then we learned orbitalmechanics in Russian and then we learnedvehicle control theory and then we gotinto the simulator and practiced overand over and over again and in fact youcan fly this meteorite and steer it landin about a 15 kilometer circle anywhereon the earth so in fact when our crewwas coming back into the atmosphereinside the Soyuz we weren't screaming wewere laughing it was fun and when thegreat big parachute opened we knew thatit if it didn't open there's a secondparachute and it runs on a nice littleclockwork mechanism so we came back wecame thundering back to earth and thisis what it looked like to land in aSoyuz in Kazakhstan you can see one ofthose search and recovery helicoptersonce again that helicopter part of adozen such Russian mi-8 helicopterstouchdown 3:14 and 48 seconds a.m.Central time and you roll to a stop isthis something through your spaceship atthe ground and it's humbles end-over-endbut you're ready for it you're in acustom-built seat you know how the shockabsorber works and then eventually theRussians reach in drag you out plunk youinto a chair and you can now look backat what was an incredible experience youhave taken the dreams of thatnine-year-old boy which were impossibleand dauntingly scary dauntinglyterrifying and put them into practiceand figured out a way to reprogramyourself to change your primal fear sothat it allowed you to come back with aset of experiences and a level ofinspiration for other people but nevercould have been possible otherwise justto finish they asked me to to play thatguitar I know this songand it's really a tribute to the geniusof David Bowie himself but it's also Ithink a reflection of the fact that weare not machines exploring the universewe are people and we're taking that thatability to adapt and that ability tounderstand and the ability to take ourour own self-perception into a new place[Music]this is Major Tom to ground controlI've left forevermore and I'm floatingin a most peculiar way and the starslook very different today[Music]planet Earth is blue and there's so muchleft to do[Music]fear notthank you thank you very much thank you",

   "title": "Can you really tell if a kid is lying? | Kang Lee",
   "publishedAt": "08 Jun 2016",
   "transcription": "Hi.Let me ask the audience a question:Did you ever lie as a child?If you did, could you pleaseraise your hand?Wow! This is the most honestgroup of people I've ever met.(Laughter)So for the last 20 years,I've been studyinghow children learn to tell lies.And today, I'm going to share with yousome of the discoveries we have made.But to begin, I'm going to tell youa story from Mr. Richard Messina,who is my friend and an elementaryschool principal.He got a phone call one day.The caller says,\"Mr. Messina, my son Johnnywill not come to school todaybecause he's sick.\"Mr. Messina asks,\"Who am I speaking to, please?\"And the caller says,\"I am my father.\"(Laughter)So this story --(Laughter)sums up very nicelythree common beliefs we haveabout children and lying.One, children only come to tell liesafter entering elementary school.Two, children are poor liars.We adults can easily detect their lies.And three, if children lieat a very young age,there must be somecharacter flaws with them,and they are going to becomepathological liars for life.Well, it turns outall of the three beliefs are wrong.We have been playing guessing gameswith children all over the world.Here is an example.So in this game, we asked childrento guess the numbers on the cards.And we tell them if they win the game,they are going to get a big prize.But in the middle of the game,we make an excuse and leave the room.And before we leave the room,we tell them not to peek at the cards.Of course,we have hidden cameras in the roomto watch their every move.Because the desireto win the game is so strong,more than 90 percent of children will peekas soon as we leave the room.(Laughter)The crucial question is:When we return and ask the childrenwhether or not they have peeked,will the children who peeked confessor lie about their transgression?We found that regardlessof gender, country, religion,at two years of age,30 percent lie,70 percent tell the truthabout their transgression.At three years of age,50 percent lie and 50 percenttell the truth.At four years of age,more than 80 percent lie.And after four years of age,most children lie.So as you can see,lying is really a typical partof development.And some children begin to tell liesas young as two years of age.So now, let's take a closer lookat the younger children.Why do some but not allyoung children lie?In cooking, you need good ingredientsto cook good food.And good lying requirestwo key ingredients.The first key ingredientis theory of mind,or the mind-reading ability.Mind reading is the ability to knowthat different people havedifferent knowledge about the situationand the ability to differentiatebetween what I knowand what you know.Mind reading is important for lyingbecause the basis of lying is that I knowyou don't knowwhat I know.Therefore, I can lie to you.The second key ingredientfor good lying is self-control.It is the ability to control your speech,your facial expressionand your body language,so that you can tell a convincing lie.And we found that those young childrenwho have more advanced mind-readingand self-control abilitiestell lies earlierand are more sophisticated liars.As it turns out, these two abilitiesare also essential for all of usto function well in our society.In fact, deficits in mind-readingand self-control abilitiesare associated with seriousdevelopmental problems,such as ADHD and autism.So if you discover your two-year-oldis telling his or her first lie,instead of being alarmed,you should celebrate --(Laughter)because it signals that your childhas arrived at a new milestoneof typical development.Now, are children poor liars?Do you think you can easilydetect their lies?Would you like to give it a try?Yes? OK.So I'm going to show you two videos.In the videos,the children are going to respondto a researcher's question,\"Did you peek?\"So try to tell mewhich child is lyingand which child is telling the truth.Here's child number one.Are you ready?(Video) Adult: Did you peek? Child: No.Kang Lee: And this is child number two.(Video) Adult: Did you peek? Child: No.KL: OK, if you thinkchild number one is lying,please raise your hand.And if you think child number twois lying, please raise your hand.OK, so as a matter of fact,child number one is telling the truth,child number two is lying.Looks like many of you are terribledetectors of children's lies.(Laughter)Now, we have played similar kinds of gameswith many, many adultsfrom all walks of life.And we show them many videos.In half of the videos, the children lied.In the other half of the videos,the children told the truth.And let's find outhow these adults performed.Because there are as many liarsas truth tellers,if you guess randomly,there's a 50 percent chanceyou're going to get it right.So if your accuracy is around 50 percent,it means you are a terrible detectorof children's lies.So let's start with undergradsand law school students,who typically havelimited experience with children.No, they cannot detect children's lies.Their performance is around chance.Now how about social workersand child-protection lawyers,who work with children on a daily basis?Can they detect children's lies?No, they cannot.(Laughter)What about judges,customs officersand police officers,who deal with liars on a daily basis?Can they detect children's lies?No, they cannot.What about parents?Can parents detect other children's lies?No, they cannot.What about, can parentsdetect their own children's lies?No, they cannot.(Laughter) (Applause)So now you may askwhy children's liesare so difficult to detect.Let me illustrate thiswith my own son, Nathan.This is his facial expressionwhen he lies.(Laughter)So when children lie,their facial expressionis typically neutral.However, behind this neutral expression,the child is actually experiencinga lot of emotions,such as fear, guilt, shameand maybe a little bit of liar's delight.(Laughter)Unfortunately, such emotionsare either fleeting or hidden.Therefore, it's mostly invisible to us.So in the last five years,we have been trying to figure out a wayto reveal these hidden emotions.Then we made a discovery.We know that underneath our facial skin,there's a rich network of blood vessels.When we experience different emotions,our facial blood flow changes subtly.And these changes are regulatedby the autonomic systemthat is beyond our conscious control.By looking at facial blood flow changes,we can reveal people's hidden emotions.Unfortunately, such emotion-relatedfacial blood flow changesare too subtle to detect by our naked eye.So to help us revealpeople's facial emotions,we have developed a new imaging technologywe call \"transdermal optical imaging.\"To do so, we use a regularvideo camera to record peoplewhen they experiencevarious hidden emotions.And then, using our imageprocessing technology,we can extract transdermal imagesof facial blood flow changes.By looking at transdermal video images,now we can easily seefacial blood flow changes associatedwith the various hidden emotions.And using this technology,we can now reveal the hidden emotionsassociated with lying,and therefore detect people's lies.We can do so noninvasively,remotely, inexpensively,with an accuracy at about 85 percent,which is far better than chance level.And in addition, we discovereda Pinocchio effect.No, not this Pinocchio effect.(Laughter)This is the real Pinocchio effect.When people lie,the facial blood flowon the cheeks decreases,and the facial blood flowon the nose increases.Of course, lying is not the only situationthat will evoke our hidden emotions.So then we asked ourselves,in addition to detecting lies,how can our technology be used?One application is in education.For example, using this technology,we can help this mathematics teacherto identify the student in his classroomwho may experience high anxietyabout the topic he's teachingso that he can help him.And also we can use this in health care.For example, every day I Skype my parents,who live thousands of miles away.And using this technology,I can not only find outwhat's going on in their livesbut also simultaneously monitortheir heart rate, their stress level,their mood and whether or notthey are experiencing pain.And perhaps in the future,their risks for heart attackor hypertension.And you may ask:Can we use this also to revealpoliticians' emotions?(Laughter)For example, during a debate.Well, the answer is yes.Using TV footage,we could detectthe politicians' heart rate,mood and stress,and perhaps in the future,whether or not they are lying to us.We can also use thisin marketing research,for example, to find outwhether or not people likecertain consumer products.We can even use it in dating.So for example,if your date is smiling at you,this technology can help you to determinewhether she actually likes youor she is just trying to be nice to you.And in this case,she is just trying to be nice to you.(Laughter)So transdermal optical imaging technologyis at a very early stage of development.Many new applications will come aboutthat we don't know today.However, one thing I know for sureis that lying will neverbe the same again.Thank you very much.Xi\u00e8 xie.(Applause)",

   "transcription": "[Music][Music]i'm a storytellerand i would like to tell you a fewpersonal stories aboutwhat i like to call the danger of thesingle storyi grew up on a university campus ineastern nigeriamy mother says that i started reading atthe age of twoalthough i think four is probably closeto the truthso i was an early reader and what i readwere british and american children'sbooksi was also an early writer and when ibegan to write at aboutthe age of seven stories in pencil withcrayon illustrations that my poor motherwas obligated to readi wrote exactly the kinds of stories iwas readingall my characters were white andblue-eyedthey played in the snow they ateapplesand they talked a lot about the weatherhow lovely it was that the sun had comeoutnow this despite the fact that i livedin nigeria had never been outsidenigeriawe didn't have snow we ate mangoesand we never talked about the weatherbecause there was no need tomy characters also drank a lot of gingerbeer because the characters in thebritish books i readdrank ginger beer never mind that i hadno idea what ginger beer wasand for many years afterwards i wouldhave a desperate desire to tasteginger beer but that is another storywhat this demonstrates i thinkis how impressionable and vulnerable weare in the face of a storyparticularly as children because all ihad read were books in whichcharacters were foreign i had becomeconvinced that booksby their very nature had to haveforeigners in themand had to be about things with which icould not personally identify now thingschanged when i discovered african booksthere weren't many of them available andthey weren't quite as easy to find asthe foreign books butbecause of writers like chinua achebeand camera lay i went througha mental shift in my perception ofliteraturei realized that people like me girlswith skin the color of chocolate whosekinky hair could not form ponytailscould also exist in literaturei started to write about things irecognizednow i loved those american and britishbooks i readthey stirred my imagination they openedup new worlds for mebut the unintended consequence was thati did not know that people like me couldexist in literatureso what the discovery of african writersdid for me was this it saved mefrom having a single story of what booksarei come from a conventional middle classnigerian family my fatherwas a professor my mother was anadministratorand so we had as was the norm livingdomestic help who would often come fromnearby rural villages so the year iturned eightwe got a new house boy his name wasfiddythe only thing my mother told us abouthim was that his family was very poormy mother sent yams and rice and our oldclothes to his familyand when i didn't finish my dinner mymother would say finish your fooddon't you know people like fide's familyhave nothingso i felt enormous pity for fide'sfamilythen one saturday we went to his villageto visit and his mother showed us abeautifully patternedbasket made of dyed raffia that hisbrother had madei was startled it had not occurred to methatanybody in his family could actuallymake somethingall i had heard about them was how poorthey were so that it had becomeimpossible for me to see them asanything else butpoor their poverty was my single storyof themyears later i thought about this when ileft nigeria to go to universityin the united states i was 19.my american roommate was shocked by meshe asked where i had learned to speakenglish so welland was confused when i said thatnigeria happened to have english as itsofficial languageshe asked if she could listen to whatshe called my tribalmusic i was consequently verydisappointed when i produced my tape ofmariah careyshe assumed that i did not know how touse a stovewhat struck me was this she had feltsorry for me even before she saw meher default position toward me as anafricanwas a kind of patronizing well-meaningpitymy roommate had a single story of africaa single story of catastrophe in thissingle story there was no possibility ofafricansbeing similar to her in any way nopossibility of feelings more complexthan kittyno possibility of a connection as humanequalsi must say that before i went to the usi didn't consciously identify as africanbut in the u.s whenever africa came uppeople turned to me never mind that iknew nothing about places like namibiabut i did come to embrace this newidentity and in many ways i think ofmyself now as africanalthough i still get quite irritablewhen africa is referred to as a countrythe most recent example being myotherwise wonderful flight from lagostwo days ago in which umthere was an announcement on the virginflight about their charity work inindia africa and other countriesso after i had spent some years in theus as an africani began to understand my roommate'sresponse to meif i had not grown up in nigeria and ifall i knew about africa werefrom popular images i too would thinkthat africa was a place ofbeautiful landscapes beautiful animalsand incomprehensible people fightingsenseless wars dying of poverty and aidsunable to speak for themselves andwaiting to be savedby a kind white foreigneri would see africans in the same waythat i as a childhad seen fide's family this single storyof africa ultimately comes i think fromwestern literaturenow here's a quote from the writing of alondon merchantcalled john locke who sailed to westafrica in1561 and kept a fascinating account ofhis voyageafter referring to the black africans asbeasts who have no houses he writesthey are also people without headshaving their mouths and eyesin their breasts now i've laughed everytime i've read this and one mustadmire the imagination of john locke butwhat is important about his writing isthat it represents the beginningof a tradition of telling africanstories in the westa tradition of sub-saharan africa as aplace of negativesof difference of darkness of people whoin the words of the wonderful poetrudyard kiplinga half devil half childand so i began to realize that myamerican roommate must have throughouther lifeseen and heard different versions of thesingle storyas had a professor who once told me thatmy novel was notauthentically african now i was quitewilling to contend that there were anumber of things wrongwith the novel that it had failed in anumber of placesbut i had not quite imagined that it hadfailed at achieving something calledafrican authenticity in fact i did notknow whatafrican authenticity was the professortold me that my characterswere too much like him and educated andmiddle-class manmy characters drove cars they were notstarvingtherefore they were not authenticallyafricanbut i must quickly add that i too amjust as guilty in the questionof the single story a few years ago ivisited mexico from the usthe political climate in the u.s at thetime was tense and there were debatesgoing on aboutimmigration and as often happens inamericaimmigration became synonymous withmexicansthere were endless stories of mexicansas people who werefleecing the health care system sneakingacross the borderbeing arrested at the border that sortof thingi remember walking around on my firstday in guadalajarawatching the people going to workrolling up to tears in the marketplacesmokinglaughing i remember first feeling slightsurpriseand then i was overwhelmed with shamei realized that i had been so immersedin the media coverage of mexicansthat they had become one thing in mymind the abjectimmigrant i had bought into the singlestory of mexicans and i could not havebeen more ashamed of myselfso that is how to create a single storyshow a peopleas one thing as only one thing over andover againand that is what they become it isimpossible to talk about the singlestory without talking aboutpower there is a wardan ebola ward that i think aboutwhenever i think about the powerstructures of the world and it is uncaliit's a noun that loosely translates toto be greater than anotherlike our economic and political worldstories too are definedby the principle of uncali how they aretoldwho tells them when they are told howmany stories are toldare really dependent on powerpower is the ability not just to tellthe story of another personbut to make it the definitive story ofthat personthe palestinian poet murid baguti writesthat if you want to dispossess a peoplethe simplest way to do it is to telltheir story and to start withsecondly start the storywith the arrows of the native americansand not with the arrival of the britishand you have an entirely different storystart the story withthe failure of the african states andnot with the colonial creationof the african state and you have anentirely differentstory i recently spoke at a universitywherea student told me that it was such ashamethat nigerian men were physical abuserslike the father character in my noveli told him that i had just read a novelcalled american psychoand that it was such a shame that youngamericans were serial murderersno nono now obviously i said this in a fit ofmild irritationbut it would never have occurred to meto think that just because i had read anovelin which a character was a serial killerthat he was somehow representative ofall americans and now this is notbecause i'm a better personthan that student but because ofamerica's cultural and economic power ihad many stories of america i had readthailand opdyke and steinbeck and greatskilli did not have a single story of americawhen i learnedsome years ago that writers wereexpected to have hadreally unhappy childhoods to besuccessfuli began to think about how i couldinvent horrible things my parents haddone to mebut the truth is that i had a very happychildhoodfull of laughter and love in a veryclose-knit familybut i also had grandfathers who died inrefugee campsmy cousin polly died because he couldnot get adequate health careone of my closest friends oklahoma diedin a plane crash because our fire trucksdid not have wateri grew up under repressive militarygovernments thatdevalued education so that sometimes myparents were not paid their salariesand so as a child i saw jam disappearfrom the breakfast tablethen margarine disappeared then breadbecame too expensivethen milk became rationedand most of all a kind of normalizedpolitical fearinvaded our livesall of these stories make me who i ambut to insist ononly these negative stories is toflatten my experienceand to overlook the many other storiesthat formed methe single story creates stereotypes andthe problemwith stereotypes is not that they areuntruebut that they are incomplete they makeone story become the only storyof course africa is a continent full ofcatastrophes theimmense ones such as the horrific rapesin congo anddepressing ones such as the fact that 5000 people apply for onejob vacancy in nigeria but there areother storiesthat are not about catastrophe and it'svery important it is just as importantto talk about themi've always felt that it is impossibleto engage properlywith a place or a person withoutengaging with all of the stories of thatplace and that personthe consequence of the single story isthisit robs people of dignity it makes ourrecognition of ourequal humanity difficult it emphasizeshow we are differentrather than how we are similar so whatif before my mexican tripi had followed the immigration debatefrom both sidesthe u.s and the mexican what if mymother had told us that fide's familywaspoor and had walking what if we had anafrican television network thatbroadcast diverse african stories allover the worldwhat the nigerian writer chino achebecalls a balance of storieswhat if my roommate knew about mynigerian publishermuktar bakari a remarkable man who lefthis job in a bank to follow his dreamand start a publishing housenow the conventional wisdom was thatnigerians don't read literaturehe disagreed he felt that people whocould readwould read if he made literatureaffordable and available to themshortly after he published my firstnovel i went to a tv station in lagos todo an interviewand a woman who walked there as amessenger came up to me and saidi really liked your novel i didn't likethe ending now you must write a sequeland this is what will happenand she went on to tell me what to writein the sequelnow i was not only charmed i was verymoved here was a womanpart of the ordinary masters ofnigerians who are not supposed to bereadersshe had not only read the book but shehad taken ownership of it and feltjustified in telling me what to write inthe sequelnow what if my roommate knew about myfriend for me yondera fearless woman who hosts a tv show inlagosand is determined to tell the storiesthat we

   "title": "How I climbed a 3,000-foot vertical cliff -- without ropes | Alex Honnold",
   "publishedAt": "29 Oct 2018",
   "transcription": "hello I'd like to show you guys 30seconds of the best day of my lifeso that was El Capitan in California'sYosemite National Park and in case youcouldn't tell I was climbing by myselfwithout a ropea style with finally known as free solong that was the culmination of anearly decade-long green and in thevideo I'm over 2500 feet off the groundseems scary yeah it is which is why Ispent so many years dreaming aboutsoloing I'll cap and not actually doingit but on the day that that video wastakenit didn't feel scary at all it felt ascomfortable and as natural as a walk inthe park which is what most folks weredoing in Yosemite that day today I'dlike to talk about how I was able tofeel so comfortable and how I overcamemy fear I'll start with a very briefversion of how I became a climber andthen tell the story of my two mostsignificant free solos they weresuccessful which is why I'm here but thefirst but the first felt largelyunsatisfying whereas the second El Capwas by far the most fulfilling day of mylife through these two climbs you'll seemy process for managing fear so Istarted climbing in the gym when I wasaround ten years old which means that mylife has been centered on climbing formore than 20 years after nearly a decadeof climbing mostly indoors I made thetransition to the outdoors and graduallystarted free soloing I built up mycomfort over time and slowly took onbigger and more challenging walls andthere have been many free solos beforeme so I had plenty of inspiration todraw from but by 2008 I'd repeated mostof their previous solos in Yosemite andwas starting to imagine breaking intonew terrain the obvious first choice wasHalf Dome an iconic 2004 that lords overthe east end of the valley the problemthough also the allure was that it wastoo big I didn't really know how toprepare for potential free solo so Idecided to skip the preparations andjust go up there and have an adventureI figured I would rise to the occasionwhich unsurprisingly was not the beststrategy I did at least climb the routeroped up with a friendtwo days before just to make sure that Iknew roughly where to go and that Icould physically do it but when I cameback by myself two days later I decidedthat I didn't want to go that way I knewthat there was a 300 foot variation thatsiraround one of the hardest parts of theclimb I suddenly decided to skip thehard part and take the variation eventhough I'd never climbed it before but Iimmediately began to doubt myselfimagine being by yourself in the deadcenter of a 2,000 foot phase wonderingif you're lost thankfully it was prettymuch the right way and I circled back tothe route I was slightly rattled I waspretty rattled we're not trying to intoa lot of try not to let it bother me toomuch because I knew that all the hardestclimbing was up the top I needed to staycomposed it was a beautiful Septembermorning and as I climbed higher I couldhear the sounds of tourists chatting andlaughing on the summit they'd all hikedup the normal trail on the back which Iwas planning on using for my descent butbetween me in the summit lay a blankslab of granite there were no cracks oredges told on to just small ripples oftexture of a slightly less than verticalwall I had to trust my life to thefriction between my climbing shoes andthe smooth granite I carefully balancedmy way upward shifting my weight backand forth between the small smears butthen I reached a foothold that I didn'tquite trust two days ago I'd juststepped right up on it but that had beenwith a rope on now it felt too small andtoo slippery I doubted that my footwould stay on if I waited it Iconsidered a foot further to the sidethere seemed worse I switched my feetand try to foot further out seemed evenworse I started to panic I could hearpeople laughing on the summit just aboveme I wanted to be anywhere but on thatslab my mind was racing in everydirection I knew what I had to do but Iwas just too afraid to do it I just hadto stand up on my right footand so after what felt like an eternityI accepted what I had to do and I stoodup on the right foot and it didn't slipand so I didn't die and that move markedthe end of the hardest climbing and so Icharged from there towards the summitand said normally when you summit HalfDome you have a rope and a bunch ofclimbing gear on you and tourists gaspand they flock around you for photosthis time I popped over the edgeshirtless panting Jack I was amped butnobody batted knifeI'd look like a lost hiker that was tooclose to the edge I was I was surroundedby people talking on cell phones andhaving picnics I felt like I was in themall I took off my tight climbing shoesand started hiking back down and that'swhen people stopped me you're hikingbarefootthat's so hardcore I didn't bother toexplain but that night in my climbingjournal I duly noted my free solo ifafter him but I included a frowny facein a comment do better question mark I'dsucceeded in the solo and it wascelebrated as a big first in climbingsome friends later made a film about itbut I was unsatisfied I was disappointedin my performance because I had knewthat I'd gotten away with something Ididn't want to be a lucky farmer Iwanted to be a great climber I actuallytook the next year or so offering freesoloing because I knew that I shouldn'tmake a habit of relying on luck but eventhough it wasn't strolling very much I'dalready started to think about our cabit was always in the back of my mind asthe obvious crown jewel with solos it'sthe most striking wall in the world eachyear for the next seven years I thinkthis is the year that I'm in a solo ElCap and then I would drive in Yosemitelook up at the wall and think no freakinway it was it's too big and too scarybut eventually I came to accept that Iwanted to test myself against El Cap herepresented true mastery but I needed itto feel different I didn't want to getaway with anything or barely squeaked bythis time I wanted to do it right thething that makes El Cap so intimidatingis this year scale of the wall mostclimbers take three to five days toascend the 3,000 feet of verticalgranite the idea of setting out up awall of that size with nothing but shoesin a chalk bag seemed impossible 3,000feet of climbing represents thousands ofdistinct hand and foot movements whichis a lot to remembermany of the moves I knew through sheerrepetition I'd climbed El Cap maybe 50times over the previous decade with arope but this photo shows my preferredmethod of rehearsing the moves I'm onthe summit about to rappel down the facewith over a thousand feet of rope tospend the day practicing by myselfthat on sequences that felt secure andrepeatable I had to memorize them I hadto make sure that they're so deeplyingrained within me that there is nopossibility of error I didn't want to beup on the wall wondering if I was goingthe right way or using the best holes Ineeded everything to feel automaticclanging that the Rope is a largelyphysical effort you just have to bestrong enough to hold on and make themovements upward but free soloing playsout more in the mind the physical effortis largely the same your body is stillclimbing the same wall but staying calmand performing at your best when youknow that any mistake could mean deathrequires a certain kind of mindsetthat's not supposed to be funny but whatit is it is I work to cultivate thatmindset through visualization whichbasically just means imagining theentire experience is soloing the wallpartially that was to help me rememberall the holds but mostly visualizationwas about feeling the texture of eachhold in my hand and imagine thesensation of my leg reaching out andplacing my foot just so I'd imagine itall like a choreographed dance thousandsof feet of the most difficult part ofthe whole route was called the boulderproblem it was about 2,000 feet off theground and consisted of the hardestphysical moves on the whole route longpoles between poor hand holds with verysmall slippery feet this were I mean bya poor hand hold an edge smaller thanthe width of a pencil but facingdownward that I had to press up intowith my thumb but that wasn't even thehardest partthe crux culminated in the karate kickwith my left foot over to the inside ofan adjacent corner a maneuver thatrequired a high degree of precision andflexibility enough so that I've beendoing a nightly stretching routine for afull year ahead of time to make surethat I could comfortably make the reachwith my leg as I practice the moves myvisualization turned to the emotionalcomponent of a potential solo basicallywhat if I got up there and it was tooscary what if I was too tiredwhat if I couldn't quite make the kick Ihad to consider every possibility whileI was safely on the ground so that whenthe time came and I was like she makingthe moves without a rope there was noroom for doubt to creep in doubt is theprecursor to fear and I knew that Icouldn't experience my perfect moment ifI was afraid I had to visualize andrehearse enough to remove all doubt butbeyond that I also visualize how itwould feel if it never seemed doablewhat if after so much work I was afraidto trywhat if I was wasting my time and Iwould never feel comfortable in such anexposed position there were no easyanswers but El Cap meant enough to methat I would put in the work and findout some of my preparations were moremundane this is a photo of my friendConrad Anker climbing up the bottom ofEl Cap with an empty backpack we spentthe day climbing together to a specificcrack in the middle of the wall that waschoked with moose rocks they made thatsection of climbing difficult andpotentially dangerous these any misstepmight knock the loose rock to the groundand kill a passing climber or hiker sowe carefully removed the rocks loadedthem into the pack and repelled backdown take a second to imagine howridiculous it feels to climb 1,500 feetup a wall just to fill a backpack fullof rocks it's never that easy to carry apack full of rocks around it's evenharder on the side of a cliff it mayhave felt silly but it still had to getdone I needed everything to feel perfectif I was ever going to climb the routewithout a rope after two seasons ofworking specifically toward a potentialfree solo vocab I finally finished allmy preparations I knew every handholdand foothold on the whole route and Iknew exactly what to do basically I wasready it was time to solo I'll cab onJune 3rd 2017 I woke up early ate myusual breakfast amusing fruit and madeit to the base of the wall beforesunriseI felt confidence I looked up the wall Ifelt even better as I started climbingabout 500 feet up our reaches slab verysimilar to the one that had given me somuch trouble and half done but this timewas differentI scouted every option includinghundreds of feet of wall to either sideI knew exactly what to do and how to doit I had no doubts I just climbed rightthrough even the difficult and strenuoussections passed by with ease I wasperfectly executing my routine I restedfor a moment below the boulder problemand then climbed it just as I hadpracticed so many times with the rope onmy foot shot across with the wall on theleft without hesitation and I knew thatI'd done climbing Half Dome had been abig goal and I did it but I didn't getwhat I really wanted I didn't achievemastery I was hesitant and afraid and itwasn't the experience that I wanted butEl Cap was different with 600 feet to goI felt like the mountain was offering mea victory lap I climbed with a smoothprecision and enjoyed the sounds of thebirds swooping around the cliffit all felt like a celebration and thenI reached the summit after three hoursand 56 minutes of glorious climbingit was the climb that I wanted and itfelt like mastery thank you[Applause][Music]",

cordhanging down and this is how it would bepositioned inside of my head and whenyou look at the brain it's obvious thatthe two cerebral cortices are completelyseparate from one another for those ofyou who understand computers our righthemisphere functions like a parallelprocessor while our left hemispherefunctions like a serial processor thetwo hemispheres do communicate with oneanother through the corpus callosumwhich is made up of some 300 millionaxonal fibers but other than that thetwo hemispheres are completely separatebecause they process informationdifferently each of our hemisphere thinkabout different things they care aboutdifferent things and dare I say theyhave very different personalities excusemethank you it's been a joy hour righthuman hemisphere is all about thispresent moment it's all about right hereright now our right hemisphere it thinksin pictures and it learnskinesthetically through the movement ofour bodies information in the form ofenergy streams in simultaneously throughall of our sensory systems and then itexplodes into this enormous collage ofwhat this present moment looks like whatthis present moment smells like andtastes like what it feels like and whatit sounds like I am an energy beingconnected to the energy all around methrough the consciousness of my righthemisphere we are energy beingsconnected to one another through theconsciousness of our right hemispheresas one human family and right here rightnowwe are brothers and sisters on thisplanet here to make the world a betterplace and in this moment we are perfectwe are whole and we are beautiful myleft hemisphere our left hemisphere is avery different place our left hemispherethinks linearly and methodically ourleft hemisphere is all about the pastand it's all about the future our lefthemisphere is designed to take thatenormous collage of the present momentand start picking out details detailsand more details about those details itthen categorizes and organizes all thatinformation associates it witheverything in the past we've everlearned and projects into the future allof our possibilities and our lefthemisphere thinks in language it's thatongoing brain chatter that connects meand my internal world to my externalworld it's that little voice that saysto me hey you got to remember to pick upan analyst on your way home I need themin the morningit's that calculating intelligence thatknows that reminds me when I have to domy laundry but perhaps most importantit's that little voice that says to me Iam I am and as soon as my lefthemisphere says to me I am I becomeseparate I become a single solidindividual separate from the energy flowaround me and separate from you and thisis the portion of my brain that I loston the morning of my stroke on themorning of a stroke I woke up to apounding pain behind my left eye and itwas the kind of pain caustic pain thatyou get when you bite into ice cream andit just gripped me and then it releasedme and then it just gripped me and thenit released me and it was very unusualfor me to ever experience any kind ofpain so I thought okay I'll just startmy normal routine so I got up and Ijumped onto my cardio glider which is afull body full exercise machineand I'm jamming away on this thing andI'm realizing that my hands look likeprimitive claws grasping onto the barand I thought that's very peculiar and Ilooked down at my body and I thoughtwhoa I'm a weird-looking thing and itwas as though my consciousness hadshifted away from my normal perceptionof reality where I'm the person on themachine having the experience to someesoteric space where I'm witnessingmyself having this experience there wasall very peculiar and my headache wasjust getting worse so I get off themachine and I'm walking across my livingroom floor and I realized thateverything inside of my body has slowedway down and every step is very rigidand very deliberate there's no fluidityto my pace and there's this constrictionin my area of perception so I'm justfocused on internal systems and I'mstanding in my bathroom getting ready tostep into the shower and I couldactually hear the dialogue inside of mybody I heard a little voice saying okayyou muscles you got a contract and youmuscles you relaxed and now I lost mybalance and I'm propped up against thethe wall and I looked down at my arm andI realized that I can no longer definethe boundaries of my body I can't definewhere I begin and where I end becausethe atoms and the molecules of my armblended with the atoms and molecules ofthe wall and only could detect was thisenergy energy and I'm asking myself whatis wrong with me what is going on and inthat moment my brain chatter my lefthemisphere brain chatter went totallysilent just like someone took a remotecontrol and pushed the mute button totalsilence and at first I was shocked tofind myself inside of a silent mind butthen I was immediately captivated by themagnificence of the energy around me andbecause I could no longer identify theboundaries of my body I felt enormousand expansive I felt at one with all theenergy that was and it wasbeautiful there then all of a sudden myleft hemisphere comes back online and itsays to me hey we had a problem we got aproblem we gotta get some help but I'mgoing oh I got a problem I got a problemso it's like okay okay I got a problembut then I immediately drifted rightback out into the consciousness and Ifictionally refer to this space as lalaland but it was beautiful there imaginewhat it would be like to be totallydisconnected from your brain chatterthat connects you to the external worldso here I am in this space and my joband any stress related to mice my job itwas gone and I felt lighter in my bodyand imagine all of the relationships inthe external world and any stressorsrelated to any of those they were goneand I felt this sense of peacefulnessand imagine what it would feel like tolose 37 years of emotional baggage oh Ifelt euphoria euphoria it was beautifulthere and then again my left hemispherecomes online and it says hey you've gotto pay attention we've got to get helpand I'm thinking I've got to get help Igot to focus so I get out of the showerand I'm mechanically dressed and I'mwalking around my apartment and I'mthinking I got to get to work I got toget to work can I Drivecan I Drive and in that moment my rightarm went totally paralyzed by my sidedid I realize oh my gosh am I having astroke I'm having a stroke and then thenext thing my brain says to me is wowthis is so cool this is so cool how manybrain scientists have the opportunity tostudy their own brain from the insideoutand then it crosses my mind but I'm avery busy woman time for a strong it'slike okay I can't stop this drunk fromhappening so I'll do this for a week ortwo and then I'll get back to my routineokay so I got a call help I got a callwork I couldn't remember the number atwork so I remembered in my office I hada business card with my number on him soI go into my business room I pull out athree inch stack of business cards andI'm looking at the card on top and eventhough I could see clearly in my mind'seye what my business card looked like Icouldn't tell if this was my card or notcuz all I could see were pixels and thepixels of the words blended with thepixels of the background and the pixelsof the symbols and I just couldn't telland then I would wait for what I call awave of clarity and in that moment Iwould be able to reattach to normalreality and I could tell that's not thecard that's not the card that's not thecard it took me 45 minutes to get oneinch down inside of that stack of cardsin the mean time for 45 minutes thehemorrhage is getting bigger in my lefthemisphere I do not understand numbers Ido not understand the telephone but it'sthe only plan I have so I take the foampad and I put it right here I take thebusiness card I put it right here andI'm matching the shape of the squiggleson the card to the shape of thesquiggles on the foam pad but then Iwould drift back out into lala land andnot remember if when I come back if I'dalready dialed those numbers so I had towield my paralyzed alarm like a stompand cover the numbers as I went alongand pushed them so that as I would comeback to normal reality I'd be able totell yes I've already dialed that numbereventually the whole number gets dialedand I'm listening to the phone and mycolleague picks up the phone and he saysto me whoaand I think that myself oh my gosh hesounds like a golden retriever and so Isay to him clear in my mind I say to himthis is Jill I need help and what comesout of my voice is whoa I think oh mygosh I sound like a golden retrieverso I couldn't know I didn't know that Icouldn't speak or understand languageuntil I tried so he recognizes that Ineed help and he and he gets me help anda little while later I'm I'm riding inan ambulance from one hospital acrossBoston to Mass General Hospital and Icurl up into a little fetal ball andjust like a balloon with the last lastbit of air of just just right out of theballoon I just felt my energy lift andjust I felt my spirit surrender and inthat moment I knew that I was no longerthe choreographer of my life and eitherthe doctors rescue my body and give me asecond chance at life or this wasperhaps my moment of transition when Iwoke later that afternoon I was shockedto discover that I was still alive whenI felt my spirit surrender I saidgoodbye to my life and my mind was nowsuspended between two very oppositeplanes of reality stimulation coming inthrough my sensory systems felt likepure pain light burned my brain likewildfire and sounds were so loud andchaotic that I could not pick a voiceout from the background noise and I justwanted to escape because I could notidentify the position of my body inspace I felt enormous and expansive likea genie just liberated from her bottleand my spirit soared free like a greatwhale Glidethrough a sea of silent euphoria nirvanaI found nirvana I remember thinkingthere's no way I would ever be able tosqueeze the enormousness of myself backinside this tiny little body but then Irealized but I'm still alive I'm stillalive and I have found nirvana and andif I have found Nirvana and I'm stillalive then everyone who is alive canfind nirvana and I pictured a worldfilled with beautiful peacefulcompassionate loving people who knewthat they could come to this space atany time and that they could purposelychoose to step to the right of theirleft hemispheres and find this peace andthen I realized what a tremendous giftthis experience could be what what astroke of insight this could be to howwe live our lives and it motivated me torecover two-and-a-half weeks after thehemorrhagethe surgeons went in and they removedthe blood clot the size of a golf ballthat was pushing on my language centersHere I am with my momma who's a trueangel in my life it took me eight yearsto completely recover so who are we weare the life force power of the universewith manual dexterity and two cognitiveminds and we have the power to choosemoment by moment who and how we want tobe in the world right here right now Ican step into the consciousness of myright hemisphere where we are I am thelife-force power of the universe I amthe life-force power the 50 trillionbeautiful molecular geniuses the makeupmyform at one with all that is or I canchoose to step into the consciousness ofmy left hemisphere where I become asingle individual a solid separate fromthe flow separate from youI am dr. Jill Bolte Taylor intellectualneuroanatomist these are the we insideof me which would you choose which doyou chooseand win I believe that the more time wespend choosing to run the deep innerpeace circuitry of our right hemispheresthe more peace we will project into theworld and the more peaceful our planetwill be and I thought that was an ideaworth spreading[Applause][Music][Music][Music]you",

   "publishedAt": "05 Mar 2009",
   "transcription": "[Music]the Dirty Jobs crew and I were called toa little town in Colorado called Craigit's only a couple dozen square milesit's in the Rockies and the job inquestion was sheep rancher my role onthe show for those of you who haven'tseen it's pretty simple I'm anapprentice and I work with the peoplewho actually do the jobs in question andmy responsibilities are to simply tryand keep up and give an honest accountof what it's like to be these people forone day in their life job in questionherding sheep great we go to Craig andwe check into a hotel and I realized thenext day that castration is going to bean absolute part of this work sonormally I never do any research at allbut this is a touchy subject and I workfor the Discovery Channel and we want toportray accurately whatever it is we doand we certainly want to do it with alot of respect for the animals so I callthe Humane Society and I say look I'mgonna be castrating some lamps can youtell me the deal and they're like yeahit's pretty straightforward they use aband basically a rubber band like this alittle smaller this one was actuallyaround the playing cards I got yesterdaybut it had a certain familiarity to itand I said well what exactly is theprocess and they said the band isapplied to the tail tightly and thenanother band is applied to the scrotumtightly blood flow is slowly aweek later the parts in question falloff great got it okay I call the SPCA toconfirm this they confirm it I also callPETA just for fun and they don't like itbut they confirm it okay that'sbasically how you do it so the next dayI go out and I'm given a horse and we goget the Lambs and we take them to a penthat we built and we go about thebusiness of animal husbandry Melanie isthe wife of Albert Albert's the shepherdin question Melanie picks up the lambtwo hands one hand on both legs and theright likewise on the left lamb goes onthe post she opens anotherall right great Albert goes in I followAlbert the crews aroundI always watch the process done thefirst time before I try it being anapprentice you know you do thatAlbert reaches in his pocket to pull outyou know this black rubber band but whatcomes out instead is a knife and I'mlike that's not rubber at all you knowand and he kind of flicked it open in away that caught the Sun that was justcoming over the Rockies it was very uhit was it was it was impressive in thespace of about two seconds Albert hadthe knife between the cartilage of thetail right next to the butt of the lamband very quickly the tail was gone andin the bucket that I was holding asecond later with a big thumb and a wellcalloused forefinger he had the scrotumfirmly in his grasp and he pulled ittoward him like so and he took the knifeand he put it on the tip now you thinkyou know what's coming Michael you don'tokayhe snips it throws the tip over hisshoulder and then grabs the scrotum andpushes it upward and then his head dipsdown obscuring my view but what I hearis a slurping sound and a noise thatsounds like velcro being yanked off asticky wall and I'm not even kiddingcan we roll the video no I'm kidding wedon't I thought it best to talk inpictures so I do something now I'venever ever done on a dirty job shooteverI say timeout stop you guys know theshow we used take one we don't do taketwothere is no writing there's no scriptingthere's no nonsense we don't fool aroundwe don't rehearse we shoot what we get Isaid stop this is nutsI mean you know what a Mississippi cuethis is crazy we can't do this you knowand Albert's like what and I'm like Idon't know what just happened butthey're testicles in this bucket and andyou know that's not how we do it he saidwell that's how we do it and I see whywould you do it this way and before Ieven let him explain I said I want to doit the right way with the rubber bandsand he says like the Humane SocietyI said yes like the Humane Society let'sdo something that doesn't make the lambsqueal and bleed we're on in fivecontinents dude we're on twice a day onthe Discovery we can't do this this isokay he goes to his box and he pulls outa bag of these little rubber bandsMelanie picks up another lamb puts it onthe post band goes on the tail band goesonscrotum lamb goes on the ground lambtakes two steps falls down it gets upshakes a little takes another couplesteps falls down I'm like this is not agood sign for this land at all gets upwalks to the cornerit's quivering and it lies down and it'sin via stress and I'm I'm looking at thelamb and I say Albert how long just youknow when's he get up it's like a daytoday how long has it take him to falloff a week meanwhile the lamb that hehad just did his little procedure on youknow he's just prancing around bleedingstoppedhe's you know nibbling on some grassfrolicking and I was just so blown awayat how completely wrong I was in that inthat second and I was reminded howutterly wrong I am so much of the timeand I was especially reminded of howwhat a ridiculously short straw I hadthat day because now I had to do whatAlbert had just done and they're like ahundred of these lambs in the pen andsuddenly this whole thing's starting tofeel like a German porno and I'm likeMelanie picks up the lamp puts it on thepost opens it up Albert hands me theknife I go in tail comes off I go in Igrab the scrotum tip it comes offAlbert instructs push it way up there Ido push it further I do the testiclesemerge they look like thumbs comingright at you right and he says bite himjust just fight him off and I've heardhim I heard all the wordswithout it how did I get here how did Imean how did I get here it's just one ofthose moments where the brain goes youknow off on its own and suddenly I'mstanding there in the Rockies and all Ican think of is the Aristoteliandefinition of a tragedy you knowAristotle says the tragedy is that isthat moment when the hero comesface-to-face with his true identity andI'm like what something jacked upmetaphor I don't like what I'm thinkingright now and I don't know I can't getthis thought out of my head and I can'tget that vision out of my out of mysight so I did what you know I had to doI went in and I think oh my somethinglike this yanked my head back and I'mstanding there with two testicles on mychin and now I can't get I can't shakethe metaphor okay I'm still in I'm stillin poetics and Aristotle and I'mthinking out of nowhere two terms comecrashing into my head that I hadn'theard since my classics professor incollege drilled them there and they areanagnorisis in peripeteiaand AG noir assistant peripeteiaanagnorisis is the Greek word fordiscovery literally the translation tothe transition from ignorance toknowledge is anagnorisis it's what ournetwork does it's what dirty jobs is andI'm up to my neck and I ignore seasevery single daygreat the other word peripeteiathat's that that's the moment in thegreat tragedies you know Euripides andSophocles that's the moment whereOedipus has his moment where he suddenlyrealizes that hot chick he's beensleeping with and having babies with ishis mother okay that's pretty whereperipeteia and this metaphor in my headI got an ignores and peripeteia on mychinI gotta tell you it's such a greatdevice though when you start to look forperipeteiayou find it you find it everywhere unifymean Bruce Willis in the sixth senseright spends the whole movie trying tohelp the little kid who sees dead peopleand then BOOMoh I'm dead peripeteia you know it'sit's it's it's crushing when theaudience sees it the right way neo inthe matrix you know oh I'm living in acomputer program that's weird you knowthese discoveries that lead to suddenrealizations you know and I've beenhaving him over 230 jobs I have him allthe time but that one that one drilledsomething home in a way that I justwasn't prepared for and as I stood therelooking at the happy lamb that you knowI had just defiled but it looked okaylooking at that poor other little thingthat I'd done it the right way on it andI just was struck by if I'm if I'm wrongabout if I'm wrong about that if I'mwrong so often in a literal waywhat other peripatetic misconceptionsmight I be able to comment upon becauselook I'm not a social anthropologist butI have a friend who is and I I talked tohim and he says hey Mike look I mean Idon't know if your you know if yourbrain is interested in this sort ofthing or not but do you realize you'veshot in every state you've worked inmining you've worked in fishing you'veworked in steel you've worked in everymajor industry you've you've had yourback shoulder to shoulder with theseguys that our politicians are desperateto relate to every four years right Ican still see Hillary doing the shots aride dribbling down her chin with thesteelworkers I mean these are the peoplethat I work with every single dayand if you have something to say abouttheir thoughts collectively it might betime to think about it because you knowfor years so that's in my head testiclesare on my chin thoughts are bouncingaround and after that shoot Dirty Jobsreally didn't change in terms of whatthe show is but it changed for mepersonally and now when I talk about theshow I no longer just tell thisyou heard and 190 like it I do but Ialso start to talk about some of theother things I got wrong some of theother notions of work that I have justbeen assuming our sacrosanct and they'renot people with dirty jobs are happierthan you think as a group they're thehappiest people I know and I don't wantto start whistling look for the unionlabel and all that happy worker crap I'mjust telling you that these are balancedpeople who do unthinkable workroadkill picker-uppers whistle whilethey work I swear to god I did it withthem they've got this amazing sort ofsymmetry to their life and I see it overand over and over again so I started towonder what would happen if wechallenged some of these sacred cowsfollow your passionwe've been talking about it here youknow for the last 36 hoursfollow your passion what could possiblybe wrong with that it's probably theworst advice I ever got you know youknow follow your dreams and go brokeright I mean that's all I heard growingup I didn't know what to do with my lifebut I was told if you follow yourpassion it's gonna work out I can giveyou 30 examples right now Bob combs thepig farmer in Las Vegas who collects theuneaten scraps of food from the casinosand feeds them to his swine why becausethere's so much protein and the stuff wedon't eat his pigs grow at twice thenormal speed and he is one rich pigfarmer and he is good for theenvironment and he spends his days doingthis incredible service and he smellslike hell but god bless him he's makinga great living you ask him did youfollow your passion here he he'd laughat you you know the guy's worthhe just got offered like sixty milliondollars for his farm and turned it downoutside of Vegas he didn't follow hispassion he stepped back and he watchedwhere everybody was going and he wentthe other way you know and I hear thatstory over and over Matt Freund a dairyfarmer in New Canaan Connecticut whowoke up one day and realized the crapfrom his cows was worth more than theirmilk if he could use it to make thesebiodegradable flower pots now he'sselling them to Walmart right he evenfollow his passion the guys come on youknow so I started to look at passion Istarted to look at efficiency versus ifstiffness as Tim talked about earlierthat's a huge distinction I started tolook at teamwork and determination andbasically all those platitudes they callsuccessor E's that hang with thatschmaltzy art in boardrooms around theworld right now that stuff it's suddenlyall been turned on its head safetysafety first is me going back to youknow OSHA and PETA and the HumaneSociety you know what what if OSHA gotit wrong I mean I will this is heresywhat I'm about to say but what if whatif it's really safety third rightnow I mean I mean really what I mean tosay is I value my safety on these crazyjobs as much as the people that I'mworking with but the ones who really getit done that they're not out theretalking about safety first they knowthat other things come first thebusiness of doing the work comes firstthe business of getting it done and youknow I'll never forget up in the BeringSea I was on a crab boat with TheDeadliest Catch guys which I which Ialso work on in the first season we'reabout a hundred miles off the coast ofRussia 50 foot seas big waves greenwater coming over the wheelhouse rightmost hazardous environment I'd ever seenand I was back with a guy lashing thepots down so I'm 40 feet off the deckwhich is like looking down at the top ofyour shoe you know and it's doing thisin the ocean unspeakably dangerous Iscamper down I go into the wheelhouseand I say with some level of you knowincredulity captain OSHA and he saysOSHA ocean and he points out there andbut in that moment that what he saidnext can't be repeated in the lower 48it can't be repeated on the factoryfloor any construction site but helooked at me and he said son and he's myage by the way he calls me son I lovethat he says son I'm the captain of acrab boat my responsibility is not toget you home alive my responsibility isto get you home rich you want to gethome alive that's on you and for therest of that day safety firstI mean I was like so you know the ideathat we create this this false the senseof complacency when all we do is talkabout somebody else's responsibility asthough it's our own and vice versaanyhow a whole lot of things I couldtalk at length about the many littledistinctions we made in the endless listof ways that I got it wrong but what itall comes down to is this I have formeda theory and I'm gonna share it now inmy remaining two minutes and 30 secondsit goes like thiswe've declared war on work as a societyall of us it's a civil war that's a coldwar really we didn't we didn't set outto do it and we didn't twist ourmustache in some Machiavellian way butwe've done it and we have waged this waron at least four fronts certainly inHollywood the way we portray workingpeople on TV it's laughable if there's aplumber he's 300 pounds and he's got agiant butt crack admit it you've seenhim all the time that's what plumberslook like right we turn them into heroeswhere we turn them into punchlinesthat's what TV does we try hard on dirtyjobs not to do that which is why I dothe work and I don't cheat but we'vewaged this war on Madison Avenue I meanso many of the commercials that come outthere in the way of a message what'sreally being said your life would bebetter if you could work a little lessif you didn't have to work so hard ifyou got home a little earlier if youcould retire a little faster if youcould punch out a little sooner it's allit's all in there over and over againand again Washington I can't even beginto talk about the deals and policies inplace that affect the bottom linereality of the available jobs because Idon't really know I just know thatthat's a funin this war and right here guys SiliconValley I mean how many people have aniPhone on them right now how many peoplehave their BlackBerry's on we're pluggedin we're connected I would never suggestfor a second that something bad has comeout of the tech revolution good griefnot to this crowd but I would suggestthat innovation without imitationthere's a complete waste of time andnobody celebrates imitation the wayDirty Jobs guys know it has to be doneyour iPhone without those people makingthe same interface the same circuitrythe same board over and over all thatyou know that's what makes it equally aspossible is the genius that goes insideof it so we've got this new toolboxyou know our tools today don't look likeshovels and picks they look like thestuff we walk around with and so thecollective effect of all of that hasbeen this marginalization of lots andlots of jobs and I realized you knowprobably too late in this game I hopenot because I don't know if I can do 200more of these things but we're gonna doas many as we can and to me the mostimportant thing to know and to reallycome face to face with is the fact thatI got it wrong about a lot of things notjust the testicles on my chin I got it Igot a lot wrong so we're thinking by weI mean me that that the thing to do isto talk about a PR campaign for workmanual laborskilled labor somebody needs to be outthere talking about the Forgottenbenefits I'm talking about grandfatherstuff the stuff a lot of us probablygrew up with but we've kind of kind ofyou know kind of lost a little barackwants to create two and a half millionjobs the infrastructure is a huge dealthis war on work that I suppose existshas casualties like any other war theinfrastructure is the first onedeclining trade school enrollments arethe second one every single year fewerelectricians fewer carpenters fewerplumbers fewer welderswere pipefitters fewer steamfitters theinfrastructure jobs that everybody istalking about creating are those guysthe ones that have been in decline overand over meanwhile we got two trilliondollars at a minimum according to theAmerican Society of Civil Engineers thatwe need to expand to even make a dent inthe infrastructure which is currentlyrated at a d-minus so if I were runningfor anything and I'm not I would simplysay that the jobs we hope to make andthe jobs we hope to create aren't gonnastick unless they're jobs that peoplewant and I know the point of thisconference is to celebrate things thatare near and dear to us but I also knowthat clean and dirty aren't oppositesthere are two sides of the same coinjust like innovation and imitation likerisk and responsibility like peripeteiaand a diagnosis like that poor littlelamb who I hope isn't quivering anymoreand like my time that's gone it's beengreat talking to you and get back towork[Applause]",

   "title": "Your brain on video games | Daphne Bavelier",
   "publishedAt": "19 Nov 2012",
   "transcription": "Translator: Joseph GeniReviewer: Morton BastI'm a brain scientist, and as a brain scientist,I'm actually interested in how the brain learns,and I'm especially interested in a possibility ofmaking our brains smarter, better and faster.This is in this context I'm going to tell youabout video games. When we say video games,most of you think about children.It's true. Ninety percent of children do play video games.But let's be frank.When the kids are in bed, who is in front of the PlayStation?Most of you. The average age of a gamer is 33 years old,not eight years old, and in fact, if we lookat the projected demographics of video game play,the video game players of tomorrow areolder adults. (Laughter)So video [gaming] is pervasive throughout our society.It is clearly here to stay. It has an amazing impacton our everyday life. Consider these statisticsreleased by Activision. After one month of releaseof the game \"Call Of Duty: Black Ops,\" it had been playedfor 68,000 yearsworldwide, right?Would any of you complain if this was the caseabout doing linear algebra?So what we are asking in the lab is, how can we leverage that power?Now I want to step back a bit.I know most of you have had the experience of coming backhome and finding your kids playing these kinds of games.(Shooting noises) The name of the game is to getafter your enemy zombie bad guysbefore they get to you, right?And I'm almost sure most of you have thought,\"Oh, come on, can't you do something more intelligentthan shooting at zombies?\"I'd like you to put this kind of knee-jerk reactionin the context of what you would have thoughtif you had found your girl playing sudokuor your boy reading Shakespeare. Right?Most parents would find that great.Well, I'm not going to tell you that playing video gamesdays in and days out is actually good for your health.It's not, and binging is never good.But I'm going to argue that in reasonable doses,actually the very game I showed you at the beginning,those action-packed shooter gameshave quite powerful effects and positive effectson many different aspects of our behavior.There's not one week that goes without some majorheadlines in the media about whether video games aregood or bad for you, right? You're all bombarded with that.I'd like to put this kind of Friday night bar discussion asideand get you to actually step into the lab.What we do in the lab is actually measure directly,in a quantitative fashion, what is the impactof video games on the brain.And so I'm going to take a few examples from our work.One first saying that I'm sure you all have heardis the fact that too much screen timemakes your eyesight worse.That's a statement about vision.There may be vision scientists among you.We actually know how to test that statement.We can step into the lab and measure how good your vision is.Well, guess what? People that don't play a lotof action games, that don't actually spend a lot of timein front of screens, have normal, or what we callcorrective-to-normal vision. That's okay.The issue is what happens with these guys that actuallyindulge into playing video games like five hours per week,10 hours per week, 15 hours per week.By that statement, their vision should be really bad, right?Guess what? Their vision is really, really good.It's better than those that don't play.And it's better in two different ways.The first way is that they're actually able to resolvesmall detail in the context of clutter, and though that meansbeing able to read the fine print on a prescriptionrather than using magnifier glasses, you can actually do itwith just your eyesight.The other way that they are better is actually being ableto resolve different levels of gray.Imagine you're driving in a fog. That makes a differencebetween seeing the car in front of youand avoiding the accident, or getting into an accident.So we're actually leveraging that work to develop gamesfor patients with low vision, and to have an impacton retraining their brain to see better.Clearly, when it comes to action video games,screen time doesn't make your eyesight worse.Another saying that I'm sure you have all heard around:Video games lead to attention problems and greater distractability.Okay, we know how to measure attention in the lab.I'm actually going to give you an example of how we do so.I'm going to ask you to participate, so you're going to haveto actually play the game with me. I'm going to show youcolored words. I want you to shout out the color of the ink.Right? So this is the first example.[\"Chair\"]Orange, good. [\"Table\"] Green.[\"Board\"] Audience: Red.Daphne Bavelier: Red.[\"Horse\"] DB: Yellow. Audience: Yellow.[\"Yellow\"] DB: Red. Audience: Yellow.[\"Blue\"] DB: Yellow.Okay, you get my point, right? (Laughter)You're getting better, but it's hard. Why is it hard?Because I introduced a conflict betweenthe word itself and its color.How good your attention is determines actually how fastyou resolve that conflict, so the young guys hereat the top of their game probably, like, did a little betterthan some of us that are older.What we can show is that when you do this kind of taskwith people that play a lot of action games,they actually resolve the conflict faster.So clearly playing those action games doesn't leadto attention problems.Actually, those action video game players havemany other advantages in terms of attention, and oneaspect of attention which is also improved for the betteris our ability to track objects around in the world.This is something we use all the time. When you're driving,you're tracking, keeping track of the cars around you.You're also keeping track of the pedestrian, the running dog,and that's how you can actually be safe driving, right?In the lab, we get people to come to the lab,sit in front of a computer screen, and we give themlittle tasks that I'm going to get you to do again.You're going to see yellow happy facesand a few sad blue faces. These are childrenin the schoolyard in Geneva during a recessduring the winter. Most kids are happy. It's actually recess.But a few kids are sad and blue because they've forgotten their coat.Everybody begins to move around, and your taskis to keep track of who had a coat at the beginningand who didn't. So I'm just going to show you an examplewhere there is only one sad kid. It's easy because you canactually track it with your eyes. You can track,you can track, and then when it stops, and there isa question mark, and I ask you, did this kid have a coat or not?Was it yellow initially or blue?I hear a few yellow. Good. So most of you have a brain. (Laughter)I'm now going to ask you to do the task, but now witha little more challenging task. There are going to bethree of them that are blue. Don't move your eyes.Please don't move your eyes. Keep your eyes fixatedand expand, pull your attention. That's the only wayyou can actually do it. If you move your eyes, you're doomed.Yellow or blue?Audience: Yellow.DB: Good.So your typical normal young adultcan have a span of about three or four objects of attention.That's what we just did. Your action video game playerhas a span of about six to seven objects of attention,which is what is shown in this video here.That's for you guys, action video game players.A bit more challenging, right? (Laughter)Yellow or blue? Blue. We have some peoplethat are serious out there. Yeah. (Laughter)Good. So in the same way that we actually seethe effects of video games on people's behavior,we can use brain imaging and look at the impactof video games on the brain, and we do find many changes,but the main changes are actually to the brain networksthat control attention. So one part is the parietal cortexwhich is very well known to control the orientation of attention.The other one is the frontal lobe, which controlshow we sustain attention, and another oneis the anterior cingulate, which controls how we allocateand regulate attention and resolve conflict.Now, when we do brain imaging, we find that all threeof these networks are actually much more efficientin people that play action games.This actually leads me to a rather counterintuitive findingin the literature about technology and the brain.You all know about multitasking. You all have been faultyof multitasking when you're drivingand you pick up your cellphone. Bad idea. Very bad idea.Why? Because as your attention shifts to your cell phone,you are actually losing the capacity to react swiftlyto the car braking in front of you, and so you'remuch more likely to get engaged into a car accident.Now, we can measure that kind of skills in the lab.We obviously don't ask people to drive around and seehow many car accidents they have. That would be a littlecostly proposition. But we design tasks on the computerwhere we can measure, to millisecond accuracy,how good they are at switching from one task to another.When we do that, we actually find that peoplethat play a lot of action games are really, really good.They switch really fast, very swiftly. They pay a very small cost.Now I'd like you to remember that result, and put itin the context of another group of technology users,a group which is actually much revered by society,which are people that engage in multimedia-tasking.What is multimedia-tasking? It's the fact that most of us,most of our children, are engaged with listening to musicat the same time as they're doing search on the webat the same time as they're chatting on Facebook with their friends.That's a multimedia-tasker.There was a first study done by colleagues at Stanfordand that we replicated that showed thatthose people that identify as being high multimedia-taskersare absolutely abysmal at multitasking.When we measure them in the lab, they're really bad.Right? So these kinds of results reallymakes two main points.The first one is that not all media are created equal.You can't compare the effect of multimedia-taskingand the effect of playing action games. They havetotally different effects on different aspects of cognition,perception and attention.Even within video games, I'm telling you right nowabout these action-packed video games.Different video games have a different effect on your brains.So we actually need to step into the lab and really measurewhat is the effect of each video game.The other lesson is that general wisdom carries no weight.I showed that to you already, like we looked at the fact thatdespite a lot of screen time, those action gamershave a lot of very good vision, etc.Here, what was really striking is that these undergraduatesthat actually report engaging in a lot of highmultimedia-tasking are convinced they aced the test.So you show them their data, you show them they are badand they're like, \"Not possible.\" You know, they havethis sort of gut feeling that, really, they are doing really, really good.That's another argument for why we need to step into the laband really measure the impact of technology on the brain.Now in a sense, when we think about the effectof video games on the brain, it's very similarto the effect of wine on the health.There are some very poor uses of wine. There are somevery poor uses of video games. But when consumedin reasonable doses, and at the right age,wine can be very good for health. There are actuallyspecific molecules that have been identifiedin red wine as leading to greater life expectancy.So it's the same way, like those action video gameshave a number of ingredients that are actually reallypowerful for brain plasticity, learning, attention,vision, etc., and so we need and we're working onunderstanding what are those active ingredients so thatwe can really then leverage them to deliver better games,either for education or for rehabilitation of patients.Now because we are interested in having an impactfor education or rehabilitation of patients, we are actuallynot that interested in how those of you that chooseto play video games for many hours on end perform.I'm much more interested in taking any of youand showing that by forcing you to play an action game,I can actually change your vision for the better,whether you want to play that action game or not, right?That's the point of rehabilitation or education.Most of the kids don't go to school saying,\"Great, two hours of math!\"So that's really the crux of the research, and to do that,we need to go one more step.And one more step is to do training studies.So let me illustrate that step witha task which is called mental rotation.Mental rotation is a task where I'm going to ask you,and again you're going to do the task,to look at this shape. Study it, it's a target shape,and I'm going to present to you four different shapes.One of these four different shapes is actually a rotatedversion of this shape. I want you to tell me which one:the first one, second one, third one or fourth one?Okay, I'll help you. Fourth one.One more. Get those brains working. Come on.That's our target shape.Third. Good! This is hard, right?Like, the reason that I asked you to do that is becauseyou really feel your brain cringing, right?It doesn't really feel like playing mindless action video games.Well, what we do in these training studies is, peoplecome to the lab, they do tasks like this one,we then force them to play 10 hours of action games.They don't play 10 hours of action games in a row.They do distributed practice, so little shots of 40 minutesseveral days over a period of two weeks.Then, once they are done with the training, they come backa few days later and they are tested again on a similar typeof mental rotation task. So this is work from a colleaguein Toronto. What they showed is that, initially,you know, subjects perform where they are expectedto perform given their age. After two weeks of trainingon action video games, they actually perform better,and the improvement is still there five months afterhaving done the training. That's really, really important.Why? Because I told you we want to use these gamesfor education or for rehabilitation. We need to have effectsthat are going to be long-lasting.Now, at this point, a number of you are probably wonderingwell, what are you waiting for, to put on the marketa game that would be good for the attentionof my grandmother and that she would actually enjoy,or a game that would be great to rehabilitate the visionof my grandson who has amblyopia, for example?Well, we're working on it, but here is a challenge.There are brain scientists like me that are beginningto understand what are the good ingredients in gamesto promote positive effects, and that's what I'm goingto call the broccoli side of the equation.There is an entertainment software industrywhich is extremely deft at coming up withappealing products that you can't resist.That's the chocolate side of the equation.The issue is we need to put the two together,and it's a little bit like with food.Who really wants to eat chocolate-covered broccoli?None of you. (Laughter) And you probably have hadthat feeling, right, picking up an education gameand sort of feeling, hmm, you know, it's not really fun,it's not really engaging. So what we needis really a new brand of chocolate, a brand of chocolatethat is irresistible, that you really want to play,but that has all the ingredients, the good ingredientsthat are extracted from the broccoli that you can't recognizebut are still working on your brains. And we're working on it,but it takes brain scientists to come and to get together,people that work in the entertainment software industry,and publishers, so these are not people that usuallymeet every day, but it's actually doable,and we are on the right track.I'd like to leave you with that thought,and thank you for your attention. (Applause)(Applause)",

   "title": "The transformative power of classical music | Benjamin Zander",
   "publishedAt": "27 Jun 2008",
   "transcription": "Probably a lot of you knowthe story of the two salesmenwho went down to Africa in the 1900s.They were sent down to findif there was any opportunityfor selling shoes,and they wrote telegramsback to Manchester.And one of them wrote,\"Situation hopeless. Stop.They don't wear shoes.\"And the other one wrote,\"Glorious opportunity.They don't have any shoes yet.\"(Laughter)Now, there's a similar situationin the classical music world,because there are some people who thinkthat classical music is dying.And there are some of uswho think you ain't seen nothing yet.And rather than gointo statistics and trends,and tell you about all the orchestrasthat are closing,and the record companies that are folding,I thought we should doan experiment tonight.Actually, it's not really an experiment,because I know the outcome.(Laughter)But it's like an experiment.Now, before we start --(Laughter)Before we start, I need to do two things.One is I want to remind youof what a seven-year-old childsounds like when he plays the piano.Maybe you have this child at home.He sounds something like this.(Music)(Music ends)I see some of you recognize this child.Now, if he practices for a yearand takes lessons, he's now eightand he sounds like this.(Music)(Music ends)He practices for another yearand takes lessons -- he's nine.(Music)(Music ends)Then he practices for another yearand takes lessons -- now he's 10.(Music)(Music ends)At that point, they usually give up.(Laughter)(Applause)Now, if you'd waited for one more year,you would have heard this.(Music)(Music ends)Now, what happened was notmaybe what you thought,which is, he suddenlybecame passionate, engaged,involved, got a new teacher,he hit puberty, or whatever it is.What actually happenedwas the impulses were reduced.You see, the first time, he was playingwith an impulse on every note.(Music)And the second,with an impulse every other note.(Music)You can see it by looking at my head.(Laughter)The nine-year-old putan impulse on every four notes.(Music)The 10-year-old, on every eight notes.(Music)And the 11-year-old,one impulse on the whole phrase.(Music)I don't know howwe got into this position.(Laughter)I didn't say, \"I'm going to movemy shoulder over, move my body.\"No, the music pushed me over,which is why I call itone-buttock playing.(Music)It can be the other buttock.(Music)You know, a gentleman was oncewatching a presentation I was doing,when I was working with a young pianist.He was the presidentof a corporation in Ohio.I was working withthis young pianist, and said,\"The trouble with youis you're a two-buttock player.You should be a one-buttock player.\"I moved his body while he was playing.And suddenly, the music took off.It took flight.The audience gaspedwhen they heard the difference.Then I got a letter from this gentleman.He said, \"I was so moved.I went back and I transformedmy entire companyinto a one-buttock company.\"(Laughter)Now, the other thing I wantedto do is to tell you about you.There are 1,600 people, I believe.My estimation is that probably 45 of youare absolutely passionateabout classical music.You adore classical music.Your FM is always on that classical dial.You have CDs in your car,and you go to the symphony,your children are playing instruments.You can't imagine your lifewithout classical music.That's the first group, quite small.Then there's another bigger group.The people who don't mind classical music.(Laughter)You know, you've come homefrom a long day,and you take a glass of wine,and you put your feet up.A little Vivaldi in the backgrounddoesn't do any harm.That's the second group.Now comes the third group:people who never listento classical music.It's just simply not part of your life.You might hear it like second-handsmoke at the airport ...(Laughter)-- and maybe a little bitof a march from \"Aida\"when you come into the hall.But otherwise, you never hear it.That's probably the largest group.And then there's a very small group.These are the peoplewho think they're tone-deaf.Amazing number of people thinkthey're tone-deaf.Actually, I hear a lot,\"My husband is tone-deaf.\"(Laughter)Actually, you cannot be tone-deaf.Nobody is tone-deaf.If you were tone-deaf,you couldn't change the gearson your car, in a stick shift car.You couldn't tell the difference betweensomebody from Texasand somebody from Rome.And the telephone. The telephone.If your mother callson the miserable telephone,she calls and says, \"Hello,\"you not only know who it is,you know what mood she's in.You have a fantastic ear.Everybody has a fantastic ear.So nobody is tone-deaf.But I tell you what.It doesn't work for meto go on with this thing,with such a wide gulfbetween those who understand,love and are passionateabout classical music,and those who haveno relationship to it at all.The tone-deaf people,they're no longer here.But even between those three categories,it's too wide a gulf.So I'm not going to go onuntil every single person in this room,downstairs and in Aspen,and everybody else looking,will come to loveand understand classical music.So that's what we're going to do.Now, you notice that there is notthe slightest doubt in my mindthat this is going to work,if you look at my face, right?It's one of the characteristicsof a leader that he not doubtfor one moment the capacityof the people he's leadingto realize whatever he's dreaming.Imagine if Martin Luther Kinghad said, \"I have a dream.Of course, I'm not surethey'll be up to it.\"(Laughter)All right. So I'm goingto take a piece of Chopin.This is a beautiful prelude by Chopin.Some of you will know it.(Music)Do you know what I thinkprobably happened here?When I started, you thought,\"How beautiful that sounds.\"(Music)\"I don't think we shouldgo to the same placefor our summer holidays next year.\"(Laughter)It's funny, isn't it?It's funny how those thoughtskind of waft into your head.And of course --(Applause)Of course, if the piece is longand you've had a long day,you might actually drift off.Then your companionwill dig you in the ribsand say, \"Wake up! It's culture!\"And then you feel even worse.(Laughter)But has it ever occurred to youthat the reason you feel sleepyin classical music is notbecause of you, but because of us?Did anybody think while I was playing,\"Why is he using so many impulses?\"If I'd done this with my head youcertainly would have thought it.(Music)(Music ends)And for the rest of your life,every time you hear classical music,you'll always be able to knowif you hear those impulses.So let's see what's really going on here.We have a B. This is a B.The next note is a C.And the job of the C is to make the B sad.And it does, doesn't it?(Laughter)Composers know that.If they want sad music,they just play those two notes.(Music)But basically, it's just a B,with four sads.(Laughter)Now, it goes down to A.Now to G.And then to F.So we have B, A, G, F.And if we have B, A, G, F,what do we expect next?(Music)That might have been a fluke.Let's try it again.(Music)Oh, the TED choir.(Laughter)And you notice nobody is tone-deaf, right?Nobody is.You know, every village in Bangladeshand every hamlet in China-- everybody knows:da, da, da, da -- da.Everybody knows, who's expecting that E.Chopin didn't want to reach the E there,because what will have happened?It will be over, like Hamlet.Do you remember?Act One, scene three,he finds out his uncle killed his father.He keeps on going upto his uncle and almost killing him.And then he backs away,he goes up to him again, almost kills him.The critics sitting in the back row there,they have to have an opinion,so they say, \"Hamlet is a procrastinator.\"Or they say, \"Hamlet hasan Oedipus complex.\"No, otherwise the playwould be over, stupid.(Laughter)That's why Shakespeare putsall that stuff in Hamlet --Ophelia going mad,the play within the play,and Yorick's skull, and the gravediggers.That's in order to delay --until Act Five, he can kill him.It's the same with the Chopin.He's just about to reach the E,and he says, \"Oops, bettergo back up and do it again.\"So he does it again.Now, he gets excited.(Music)That's excitement, don't worry about it.Now, he gets to F-sharp,and finally he goes down to E,but it's the wrong chord --because the chordhe's looking for is this one,and instead he does ...Now, we call that a deceptive cadence,because it deceives us.I tell my students,\"If you have a deceptive cadence,raise your eyebrows,and everybody will know.\"(Laughter)(Applause)Right.He gets to E, but it's the wrong chord.Now, he tries E again.That chord doesn't work.Now, he tries the E again.That chord doesn't work.Now, he tries E again,and that doesn't work.And then finally ...There was a gentlemanin the front row who went, \"Mmm.\"(Laughter)It's the same gesturehe makes when he comes homeafter a long day, turns offthe key in his car and says,\"Aah, I'm home.\"Because we all know where home is.So this is a piece which goesfrom away to home.I'm going to play it all the way throughand you're going to follow.B, C, B, C, B, C, B --down to A, down to G, down to F.Almost goes to E, but otherwisethe play would be over.He goes back up to B,he gets very excited.Goes to F-sharp. Goes to E.It's the wrong chord.It's the wrong chord.And finally goes to E, and it's home.And what you're going to seeis one-buttock playing.(Laughter)Because for me, to join the B to the E,I have to stop thinkingabout every single note along the way,and start thinking about the long,long line from B to E.You know, we were just in South Africa,and you can't go to South Africawithout thinking of Mandelain jail for 27 years.What was he thinking about? Lunch?No, he was thinkingabout the vision for South Africaand for human beings.This is about vision.This is about the long line.Like the bird who flies over the fieldand doesn't care about the fencesunderneath, all right?So now, you're going to followthe line all the way from B to E.And I've one last request before I playthis piece all the way through.Would you think of somebody who you adore,who's no longer there?A beloved grandmother, a lover --somebody in your lifewho you love with all your heart,but that person is no longer with you.Bring that person into your mind,and at the same time,follow the line all the way from B to E,and you'll hear everythingthat Chopin had to say.(Music)(Music ends)(Applause)Now, you may be wondering --(Applause)(Applause ends)You may be wondering why I'm clapping.Well, I did this at a school in Bostonwith about 70 seventhgraders, 12-year-olds.I did exactly what I did with you,and I explained the whole thing.At the end, they went crazy, clapping.I was clapping. They were clapping.Finally, I said, \"Why am I clapping?\"And one of them said,\"Because we were listening.\"(Laughter)Think of it. 1,600 people, busy people,involved in all sorts of different things,listening, understanding and being movedby a piece by Chopin.Now, that is something.Am I sure that every singleperson followed that,understood it, was moved by it?Of course, I can't be sure.But I'll tell you what happenedto me in Irelandduring the Troubles, 10 years ago,and I was working with some Catholicand Protestant kidson conflict resolution.And I did this with them --a risky thing to do,because they were street kids.And one of them came to methe next morningand he said,\"You know, I've never listenedto classical music in my life,but when you playedthat shopping piece ...\"(Laughter)He said, \"My brother was shot last yearand I didn't cry for him.But last night,when you played that piece,he was the one I was thinking about.And I felt the tearsstreaming down my face.And it felt reallygood to cry for my brother.\"So I made up my mind at that momentthat classical music is for everybody.Everybody.Now, how would you walk --my profession, the music professiondoesn't see it that way.They say three percent of the populationlikes classical music.If only we could move it to four percent,our problems would be over.(Laughter)How would you walk?How would you talk? How would you be?If you thought, \"Three percentof the population likes classical music,if only we could move it to four percent.\"How would you walk or talk?How would you be?If you thought, \"Everybodyloves classical music --they just haven't found out about it yet.\"See, these are totally different worlds.Now, I had an amazing experience.I was 45 years old,I'd been conducting for 20 years,and I suddenly had a realization.The conductor of an orchestradoesn't make a sound.My picture appearson the front of the CD --(Laughter)But the conductor doesn't make a sound.He depends, for his power,on his ability to makeother people powerful.And that changed everything for me.It was totally life-changing.People in my orchestra said,\"Ben, what happened?\"That's what happened.I realized my job was to awakenpossibility in other people.And of course, I wanted to knowwhether I was doing that.How do you find out?You look at their eyes.If their eyes are shining,you know you're doing it.You could light up a villagewith this guy's eyes.(Laughter)Right. So if the eyes are shining,you know you're doing it.If the eyes are not shining,you get to ask a question.And this is the question:who am I beingthat my players' eyes are not shining?We can do that with our children, too.Who am I being,that my children's eyes are not shining?That's a totally different world.Now, we're all about to endthis magical, on-the-mountain week,we're going back into the world.And I say, it's appropriatefor us to ask the question,who are we being as we go backout into the world?And you know, I havea definition of success.For me, it's very simple.It's not about wealth and fame and power.It's about how many shining eyesI have around me.So now, I have one last thought,which is that it really makesa difference what we say --the words that come out of our mouth.I learned this from a womanwho survived Auschwitz,one of the rare survivors.She went to Auschwitzwhen she was 15 years old.And ...And her brother was eight,and the parents were lost.And she told me this, she said,\"We were in the train going to Auschwitz,and I looked down and sawmy brother's shoes were missing.I said, 'Why are you so stupid,can't you keep your things togetherfor goodness' sake?'\"The way an elder sister might speakto a younger brother.Unfortunately, it was the lastthing she ever said to him,because she never saw him again.He did not survive.And so when she came outof Auschwitz, she made a vow.She told me this.She said, \"I walked outof Auschwitz into lifeand I made a vow.And the vow was,\"I will never say anything that couldn'tstand as the last thing I ever say.\"Now, can we do that? No.And we'll make ourselves wrongand others wrong.But it is a possibility to live into.Thank you.(Applause)Shining eyes.(Applause)Shining eyes.(Applause)Thank you, thank you.",

   "title": "Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein",
   "publishedAt": "29 Apr 2014",
   "transcription": "The Olympic motto is \"Citius, Altius, Fortius.\"Faster, Higher, Stronger.And athletes have fulfilled that motto rapidly.The winner of the 2012 Olympic marathonran two hours and eight minutes.Had he been racing against the winnerof the 1904 Olympic marathon,he would have won by nearly an hour and a half.Now we all have this feelingthat we're somehow just getting betteras a human race, inexorably progressing,but it's not like we've evolved into a new speciesin a century.So what's going on here?I want to take a look at what's really behindthis march of athletic progress.In 1936, Jesse Owensheld the world record in the 100 meters.Had Jesse Owens been racing last yearin the world championships of the 100 meters,when Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt finished,Owens would have still had 14 feet to go.That's a lot in sprinter land.To give you a sense of how much it is,I want to share with you a demonstrationconceived by sports scientist Ross Tucker.Now picture the stadium last yearat the world championships of the 100 meters:thousands of fans waiting with baited breathto see Usain Bolt, the fastest man in history;flashbulbs popping as thenine fastest men in the worldcoil themselves into their blocks.And I want you to pretendthat Jesse Owens is in that race.Now close your eyes for asecond and picture the race.Bang! The gun goes off.An American sprinter jumps out to the front.Usain Bolt starts to catch him.Usain Bolt passes him, and asthe runners come to the finish,you'll hear a beep as each man crosses the line.(Beeps)That's the entire finish of the race.You can open your eyes now.That first beep was Usain Bolt.That last beep was Jesse Owens.Listen to it again.(Beeps)When you think of it like that,it's not that big a difference, is it?And then consider that Usain Bolt startedby propelling himself out of blocksdown a specially fabricated carpetdesigned to allow him to travelas fast as humanly possible.Jesse Owens, on the other hand,ran on cinders, the ash from burnt wood,and that soft surface stole far more energyfrom his legs as he ran.Rather than blocks, JesseOwens had a gardening trowelthat he had to use to dig holesin the cinders to start from.Biomechanical analysis of the speedof Owens' joints shows that had been runningon the same surface as Bolt,he wouldn't have been 14 feet behind,he would have been within one stride.Rather than the last beep,Owens would have been the second beep.Listen to it again.(Beeps)That's the difference tracksurface technology has made,and it's done it throughout the running world.Consider a longer event.In 1954, Sir Roger Bannisterbecame the first man to rununder four minutes in the mile.Nowadays, college kids do that every year.On rare occasions, a high school kid does it.As of the end of last year,1,314 menhad run under four minutes in the mile,but like Jesse Owens,Sir Roger Bannister ran on soft cindersthat stole far more energy from his legsthan the synthetic tracks of today.So I consulted biomechanics expertsto find out how much slower it is to run on cindersthan synthetic tracks,and their consensus that it'sone and a half percent slower.So if you apply a one and a halfpercent slowdown conversionto every man who ran his sub-four mileon a synthetic track,this is what happens.Only 530 are left.If you look at it from that perspective,fewer than ten new men per [year]have joined the sub-four mile clubsince Sir Roger Bannister.Now, 530 is a lot more than one,and that's partly becausethere are many more peopletraining today and they're training more intelligently.Even college kids are professional in their trainingcompared to Sir Roger Bannister,who trained for 45 minutes at a timewhile he ditched gynecology lectures in med school.And that guy who won the 1904 Olympic marathonin three in a half hours,that guy was drinking rat poison and brandywhile he ran along the course.That was his idea of a performance-enhancing drug.(Laughter)Clearly, athletes have gotten more savvyabout performance-enhancing drugs as well,and that's made a differencein some sports at some times,but technology has made a difference in all sports,from faster skis to lighter shoes.Take a look at the record forthe 100-meter freestyle swim.The record is always trending downward,but it's punctuated by these steep cliffs.This first cliff, in 1956, is the introductionof the flip turn.Rather than stopping and turning around,athletes could somersault under the waterand get going right away in the opposite direction.This second cliff, the introduction of gutterson the side of the poolthat allows water to splash off,rather than becoming turbulencethat impedes the swimmers as they race.This final cliff,the introduction of full-bodyand low-friction swimsuits.Throughout sports, technology haschanged the face of performance.In 1972, Eddy Merckx set the recordfor the longest distance cycled in one hourat 30 miles, 3,774 feet.Now that record improved and improvedas bicycles improved and became more aerodynamicall the way until 1996,when it was set at 35 miles, 1,531 feet,nearly five miles fartherthan Eddy Merckx cycled in 1972.But then in 2000, the International Cycling Uniondecreed that anyone who wanted to hold that recordhad to do so with essentially the same equipmentthat Eddy Merckx used in 1972.Where does the record stand today?30 miles, 4,657 feet,a grand total of 883 feetfarther than Eddy Merckx cycledmore than four decades ago.Essentially the entire improvement in this recordwas due to technology.Still, technology isn't the onlything pushing athletes forward.While indeed we haven't evolvedinto a new species in a century,the gene pool within competitive sportsmost certainly has changed.In the early half of the 20th century,physical education instructors and coacheshad the idea that the average body typewas the best for all athletic endeavors:medium height, medium weight, no matter the sport.And this showed in athletes' bodies.In the 1920s, the average elite high-jumperand average elite shot-putterwere the same exact size.But as that idea started to fade away,as sports scientists and coaches realized thatrather than the average body type,you want highly specialized bodiesthat fit into certain athletic niches,a form of artificial selection took place,a self-sorting for bodies that fit certain sports,and athletes' bodies becamemore different from one another.Today, rather than the same sizeas the average elite high jumper,the average elite shot-putteris two and a half inches tallerand 130 pounds heavier.And this happened throughout the sports world.In fact, if you plot on a height versus mass graphone data point for each of two dozen sportsin the first half of the 20th century, it looks like this.There's some dispersal,but it's kind of groupedaround that average body type.Then that idea started to go away,and at the same time, digital technology --first radio, then television and the Internet --gave millions, or in some cases billions, of peoplea ticket to consume elite sports performance.The financial incentives and fame and gloryafforded elite athletes skyrocketed,and it tipped toward the tinyupper echelon of performance.It accelerated the artificialselection for specialized bodies.And if you plot a data point for these sametwo dozen sports today, it looks like this.The athletes' bodies have gottenmuch more different from one another.And because this chart looks like the chartsthat show the expanding universe,with the galaxies flying away from one another,the scientists who discovered it call it\"The Big Bang of Body Types.\"In sports where height is prized, like basketball,the tall athletes got taller.In 1983, the National Basketball Associationsigned a groundbreaking agreementmaking players partners in the league,entitled to shares of ticket revenuesand television contracts.Suddenly, anybody who could be an NBA playerwanted to be,and teams started scouring the globefor the bodies that couldhelp them win championships.Almost overnight,the proportion of men in the NBAwho are at least seven feet tall doubledto 10 percent.Today, one in 10 men in the NBAis at least seven feet tall,but a seven-foot-tall man is incredibly rarein the general population --so rare that if you know an American manbetween the ages of 20 and 40who is at least seven feet tall,there's a 17 percent chancehe's in the NBA right now.(Laughter)That is, find six honest seven footers,one is in the NBA right now.And that's not the only way thatNBA players' bodies are unique.This is Leonardo da Vinci's \"Vitruvian Man,\"the ideal proportions,with arm span equal to height.My arm span is exactly equal to my height.Yours is probably very nearly so.But not the average NBA player.The average NBA player is a shade under 6'7\",with arms that are seven feet long.Not only are NBA players ridiculously tall,they are ludicrously long.Had Leonardo wanted to drawthe Vitruvian NBA Player,he would have needed a rectangle and an ellipse,not a circle and a square.So in sports where large size is prized,the large athletes have gotten larger.Conversely, in sports wherediminutive stature is an advantage,the small athletes got smaller.The average elite female gymnastshrunk from 5'3\" to 4'9\" on averageover the last 30 years,all the better for their power-to-weight ratioand for spinning in the air.And while the large got largerand the small got smaller,the weird got weirder.The average length of the forearmof a water polo player in relationto their total arm got longer,all the better for a forceful throwing whip.And as the large got larger,small got smaller, and the weird weirder.In swimming, the ideal body typeis a long torso and short legs.It's like the long hull of a canoefor speed over the water.And the opposite is advantageous in running.You want long legs and a short torso.And this shows in athletes' bodies today.Here you see Michael Phelps,the greatest swimmer in history,standing next to Hicham El Guerrouj,the world record holder in the mile.These men are seven inches different in height,but because of the body typesadvantaged in their sports,they wear the same length pants.Seven inches difference in height,these men have the same length legs.Now in some cases, the search for bodiesthat could push athletic performance forwardended up introducing into the competitive worldpopulations of people that weren'tpreviously competing at all,like Kenyan distance runners.We think of Kenyans as being great marathoners.Kenyans think of the Kalenjin tribeas being great marathoners.The Kalenjin make up just 12 percentof the Kenyan populationbut the vast majority of elite runners.And they happen, on average,to have a certain unique physiology:legs that are very longand very thin at their extremity,and this is because they have their ancestryat very low latitudein a very hot and dry climate,and an evolutionary adaptation to thatis limbs that are very longand very thin at the extremityfor cooling purposes.It's the same reason that a radiator has long coils,to increase surface area compared to volumeto let heat out,and because the leg is like a pendulum,the longer and thinner it is at the extremity,the more energy-efficient it is to swing.To put Kalenjin running success in perspective,consider that 17 American men in historyhave run faster than two hours and 10 minutesin the marathon.That's a four-minute-and-58-second-per-mile pace.Thirty-two Kalenjin men did that last October.(Laughter)That's from a source population the sizeof metropolitan Atlanta.Still, even changing technologyand the changing gene pool in sportsdon't account for all of the changes in performance.Athletes have a different mindset than they once did.Have you ever seen in a movie when someone getsan electrical shockand they're thrown across a room?There's no explosion there.What's happening when that happens is thatthe electrical impulse is causingall their muscle fibers to twitch at once,and they're throwing themselves across the room.They're essentially jumping.That's the powerthat's contained in the human body.But normally we can't access nearly all of it.Our brain acts as a limiter,preventing us from accessingall of our physical resources,because we might hurt ourselves,tearing tendons or ligaments.But the more we learn abouthow that limiter functions,the more we learn how we can push it backjust a bit,in some cases by convincing the brainthat the body won't be in mortal dangerby pushing harder.Endurance and ultra-endurance sportsserve as a great example.Ultra-endurance was once thought to be harmfulto human health,but now we realizethat we have all these traitsthat are perfect for ultra-endurance:no body fur and a glut of sweat glandsthat keep us cool while running;narrow waists and long legs compared to our frames;large surface area of joints for shock absorption.We have an arch in our foot that acts like a spring,short toes that are better for pushing offthan for grasping tree limbs,and when we run,we can turn our torso and our shoulderslike this while keeping our heads straight.Our primate cousins can't do that.They have to run like this.And we have big old butt musclesthat keep us upright while running.Have you ever looked at an ape's butt?They have no buns because they don't run upright.And as athletes have realizedthat we're perfectly suited for ultra-endurance,they've taken on featsthat would have been unthinkable before,athletes like Spanish endurance racer K\u00edlian Jornet.Here's K\u00edlian running up the Matterhorn.(Laughter)With a sweatshirt there tied around his waist.It's so steep he can't even run here.He's pulling up on a rope.This is a vertical ascentof more than 8,000 feet,and K\u00edlian went up and downin under three hours.Amazing.And talented though he is,K\u00edlian is not a physiological freak.Now that he has done this,other athletes will follow,just as other athletes followedafter Sir Roger Bannisterran under four minutes in the mile.Changing technology, changing genes,and a changing mindset.Innovation in sports,whether that's new track surfacesor new swimming techniques,the democratization of sport,the spread to new bodiesand to new populations around the world,and imagination in sport,an understanding of what the human bodyis truly capable of,have conspired to make athletes stronger,faster, bolder,and better than ever.Thank you very much.(Applause)",

   "transcription": "when people find out I write about timemanagement they assume two things one isthat I'm always on timeand I'm not I have four small childrenand I would like to blame them for myoccasional tardiness but sometimes it'sjust not their faultI was once late to my own speech on timemanagementwe all had to just take a momenttogether and savor that irony the secondthing they assume is that I have lots oftips and tricks for saving bits of timehere and there sometimes I'll hear frommagazines that are doing a story alongthese lines generally on how to helptheir readers find an extra hour in theday and the idea is that we will shavebits of time off every day activitiesadd it up and we'll have time for thegood stuff and I question the entirepremise of this piece but I'm alwaysinterested in hearing what they've comeup with before they call me so some ofmy favorites doing errands in a waywhere you only have to make right-handturns being extremely judicious inmicrowave usage so it says three tothree and a half minutes on the packagewe are totally getting in on the bottomside of that and my personal favoritewhich makes sense on some level is toDVR your favorite shows so you canfast-forward through the commercials andthat way you save about eight minutesevery half-hourso in the course of two hours ofwatching TV you find 32 minutes toexercise which is true you know anotherway to find 32 minutes to exercise don'twatch two hours of TV a day rightanyway the ideas will save bits of timehere and there are added up we willfinally get to everything we want to dobut after studying how successful peoplespend their time and looking at theirschedules hour by hour I think this ideahas it completely backward we don'tbuild the lives we want by saving timewe build the lives we want and then timesaves itself here's what I mean Irecently did a time diary projectlooking at a thousand and one days inthe lives of extremely busywomen they had demanding jobs sometimestheir own businesses kids to care formaybe parents to care for communitycommitments busy busy people I had tokeep track of their time for a week so Icould add up how much they worked andslept and I interviewed them about theirstrategies for my book one of the womenwhose time logs I studied she goes outfor a Wednesday night for something shecomes home to find that her water heaterhas broken and there is now water allover her basement if you've ever hadanything like this happened to you youknow it is a hugely damaging frighteningsopping mess so she's dealing with theimmediate aftermath at night next dayshe's got plumbers coming in day afterthat professional cleaning crew dealingwith the ruined carpet all this is beingrecorded on her time log winds up takingseven hours of her week seven hoursthat's like finding an extra hour in theday but I'm sure if you had asked her atthe start of the week could you findseven hours to train for a triathloncould you find seven hours to mentorseven worthy people I'm sure she wouldhave said what most of us would havesaid which is no can't you see how busyI am yet when she had to find sevenhours because there is water all overher basementshe found seven hours and what thisshows us is that time is highly elasticwe cannot make more time but time willstretch to accommodate what we choose toput into it and so the key to timemanagement is treating our priorities asthe equivalent of that broken waterheater and to get at this I like to usesome language from one of the busiestpeople I ever interviewed by busy I meanshe was running a small business of 12people on the payroll she had sixchildren in her spare time I was gettingin touch with her to set up an interviewon how she had it all that phrase Iremember it was a Thursday morning andshe was not available to speak with meof course right but the reason she wasunavailable to speak with me is that shewas out for a hike because it was abeautiful spring morning and she wantedto go for a hike so of course this makesme even more intrigued and when Ifinally do catch up with her sheexplains it like this she says listenLauraeverything I do every minute I spend ismy choice and rather than say I don'thave time to do X Y or Z should say Idon't do X Y or Z because it's not apriority I don't have time often meansit's not a priority if you think aboutit that's really more accurate languageI mean I could tell you I don't havetime to dust my blinds but that's nottrue if you offered to pay me a hundredthousand dollars to go dust my blinds Iwould get to it pretty quickly sincethat is not going to happen I canacknowledge this is not a matter oflacking time is that I don't want to doit using this language reminds us thattime is a choice and granted there maybe horrible consequences for makingdifferent choices I will give you thatbut we are smart people and certainlyover the long run we have the power tofill our lives with the things thatdeserve to be there so how do we do thathow do we treat our priorities as theequivalent of that broken water heaterwell first we need to figure out whatthey are I want to give you twostrategies for thinking about this thefirst on the professional side I'm suremany people coming up to the end of theyear or giving or getting annualperformance reviews you look back overyour successes over the year youropportunities for growth and this servesits purpose but I find it's moreeffective to do this looking forward soonce you pretend is the end of next yearyou're giving yourself a performancereview and it has been an absolutelyamazing year for you professionally whatthree to five things did you do thatmade it so amazing so you can write nextyear's performance review now and youcan do this for your personal life tooI'm sure many of you like me comeDecember get cards that contain thesefolded up sheets of colored paper onwhich is written what is known as thefamily holiday letter bit of a wretchedgenre of literature really going onabout how amazing everyone in thehousehold is or even more scintillatinghow busy everyone in the household isbut these letters sirpurpose which is that they tell yourfriends and family what you did and yourpersonal life that matter to you overthe course of the year so this year'skind of done but I want you to pretendit's the end of next year and it hasbeen an absolutely amazing year for youand the people you care about what 3 to5 things did you do that made it soamazing so you can write next year'sfamily holiday letter now don't send itplease don't send it but you can writeit and now between the performancereview and the family holiday letter wehave a list of six to ten goals we canwork on in the next year and now we needto break these down into doable steps somaybe you want to write a family historywell first you can read some otherfamily histories get a sense for thestyle then maybe think about thequestions you want to ask your relativesset up appointments to interview them ormaybe you want to run a 5k so you needto find a race and sign up and figureout a training plan and dig those shoesout of the back of the closet and thenthis is key we treat our priorities asthe equivalent of that broken waterheater by putting them into ourschedules first and we do this bythinking through our weeks before we arein them I find a really good time to dothis is Friday afternoons Fridayafternoon is what an economist mightcall a low opportunity cost time most ofus are not sitting there on Fridayafternoons saying I am excited to makeprogress toward my personal andprofessional priorities right now but weare willing to think about what thoseshould be so take a little bit of timeFriday afternoon make yourself a threecategory priority list careerrelationships self making a threecategory list reminds us that thereshould be something in all threecategories career we think aboutrelationships self not so much butanyway just a short list two to threeitems in each then look out over thewhole of the next week and see where youcan plan them in where you plan them inis up to you and I know this is going tobe more complicated for some people thanothers I meansome people's lives are just harder thanothers it is not going to be easy tofind time to take that poetry class ifyou are caring for multiple children onyour own I get that and I don't want tominimize anyone's struggle but I dothink that the numbers I am about totell you are empowering there are 168hours in a week 24 times seven is ahundred sixty eight hours that is a lotof time if you are working a full-timejob so 40 hours a week sleeping eighthours a night so 56 hours a weekthat leaves 72 hours for other thingsthat is a lot of time you say you'reworking 50 hours a week maybe a main jobin a side hustle well that leaves 62hours for other things you say you'reworking 60 hours well that leaves 52hours for other things you say you'reworking more than 60 hours well are yousurethere was once a study comparingpeople's estimated work weeks with timediaries found that people claiming 75plus hour work weeks were off by about25 hours you can guess in whichdirection right anyway in 168 hours aweek I think we can find time for whatmatters to you if you want to spend moretime with your kids you want to studymore for a test you're taking you wantto exercise for three hours andvolunteer for two you can and that'seven if you're working way more thanfull time hours so we have plenty oftime which is great because guess whatwe don't even need that much time to doamazing things but when most of us havebits of time what do we do pull out thephone right start deleting emails orotherwise we're puttering around thehouse or watching TV but small momentscan have great power you can use yourbits of time for bits of joy maybe it'schoosing to read something wonderful onthe bus on the way to work I know when Ihad a job that required two bus rides ina subway ride every morning I used to goto the library on weekends to get stuffto read made the whole experience alljust almost enjoyable breaks at work canbe used for meditating or praying iffamily dinner is out because of yourcrazy work schedule maybe familybreakfast could be a good substituteit's about looking at the whole of one'stime and seeing where the good stuff cango I truly believe this there is timeeven if we are busy we have time forwhat matters and when we focus on whatmatters we can build the lives we wantin the time we've got thank you[Applause]",

   "transcription": "why does the universe exist why is therea word okay okay all right this is acosmic mystery be solemn why is there aworld why are we in it why is theresomething rather than nothing at all Imean this is the super ultimate whyquestion so I'm gonna talk about themystery of existence the puzzle ofexistence where we are now in addressingit and why you should care and I hopeyou do care the philosopher art orSchopenhauer said that those who don'twonder about the contingency of theirexistence of the contingency of theworld's existence are mentally deficientall right that's a little harsh but butstill yeah so this has been called themost sublime and awesome mystery thedeepest and most far-reaching questionman can pose its obsessed great thinkersLudvig Vidkun Stein perhaps the greatestphilosopher of the twentieth century wasastonished that there should be a worldat all he wrote into his Tractatusproposition four point six six it is nothow things are in the world that is themystical it's that the world exists andif you don't like taking your epigramsfrom a philosopher try a scientist JohnArchibald wheeler one of the greatphysicists of the 20th century theteacher of Richard Fineman the corner ofthe term black hole he said I want toknow how come the quantum how come theuniverse how come existence and myfriend Martin Ames whether I'll be doinga lot of name-dropping in this talk soget used to it my dear friend MartinAmos once said thatonce said that we're about fiveEinsteins away from answering themystery of where the universe came fromand I no doubt they're five Einsteins inthe audience tonight the Einsteins showof hands no no no I'm sorry so um thewho there's this question why is theresomething rather than nothing thisSablan question was posed rather late inin intellectual history it was intowards the end of the 17th century thephilosopher Leibniz who asked it verysmart guy Leibniz was a Co invented thecalculus independently of Isaac Newtonat about the same time but for Leibnizwho asked why is there something ratherthan nothing this was not a greatmystery you know he either was orpretended to be an Orthodox Christianand his metaphysical outlook and he saidit's obvious why the world existsbecause God created it and God createdindeed out of nothing at all that's howpowerful God is he doesn't need anypreexisting materials to fashion a worldout of he can make it out of sheernothingness creation ex nihilo and bythe way this is what most Americanstoday believe there's no mystery ofexistence for them God made it okay solet's put this in an equation I don'thave any slides so I'm going to mine myvisuals so use your imaginations so it'sGod plus nothing equals the world okaynow that's the equation and so maybe youdon't believe in God maybe you're ascientific atheist or an unscientificatheist and you don't believe in God andyou're not happy with it by the way evenif you even if you we have this equationGod plus nothing equals the worldthere's already a problem why this Godexists you know God doesn't exist bylogic alone unless you believe theontological argument I hope you don'tbecause it's not a good argument so youknow it's conceived God were to exist hemight wonder you know I'm eternal I'mall-powerful but where did I come fromand and whence then am i God speaks in amore formal English and soand so that you know one theory is thatGod was so bored with pondering thepuzzle of his own existence that hecreated the world you know just todistract himself but anyways forgetabout God so we have take out of theequation we have blank plus nothingequals the world now if you're aBuddhist you might want to stop rightthere because essentially you've gotwhat you've got is nothing equals theworld and by symmetry of identity thatmeans the world equals nothing okay andto a Buddhist the world is just a wholelot of nothing it's a big cosmic vacuityand you know we think there's a lot ofsomething out there but that's becausewe're enslaved by our desiresif we let large desires kind of meltaway we'll see the world for what ittruly is a vacuity nothingness and we'llslip into this happy state of Nirvanawhich has been defined as having justenough life to enjoy being dead okay sothat's it that's the Buddhists like okaybut but I'm not I'm an I'm a westernerand I'm still concerned with the puzzleof existence so I've got say blank plusit's gonna get serious in a minute soblank plus nothing equals the world whatare we gonna put that blankwell how about science I mean science isour best guide to the nature of realityand the most fundamental science isphysics that tells us what naked realityreally is that that reveals what I calltau foe to the true and ultimatefurniture of the universe so maybephysics can fill this blank and indeedsince about you know 19 the late 1960saround 1970 physicists have purported togive a purely scientific explanation ofhow a universe like ours could havepopped into existence out of sheernothingness a quantum fluctuation out ofthe void Stephen Hawking is one of thesephysicists were recently Alex Vilenkinand the whole thing has been popularizedby another very fine physicist andfriend of mine Lawrence Krauss who wrotea book called a universe from nothingand Lawrence thinks that he's given apiece of militant atheist by the way sohe's gotten God into the picture thelaws of quantum field theory the stateof the art physics can show how out ofsheer nothingness no space no time nomatter nota little nugget of false vacuum canfluctuate into existence and then by themiracle of inflation blow up into thishuge and variegated cosmos we see aroundus okay this is really it's an ingeniousscenario it's very speculative it's it'sfascinating but I've got a big problemwith it and the problem is thisit's a pseudo religious point of viewnow Laurence thinks he's an atheist buthe's still in thrall to a religiousworldview he sees physical laws as beinglike divine commands you know the lawsof quantum field theory for him are likeFiat Lux let there be light the lawshave some sort of ontological powercloud that they can call they can informthe abyss that it's it's pregnant withbeing they can call a world intoexistence out of nothing but that's avery primitive view of what the physicallaw is right we know that physical lawsare actually generalized descriptions ofpatterns and regularities in the worldthey don't exist outside the world theydon't have any on to cloud of their ownthey can't call a world into existenceout of nothingness that's a veryprimitive view of what of what as ascientific law is and if you don'tbelieve me on this you could listen toStephen Hawking who himself put forwarda model of the cosmos that wasself-contained didn't require anyoutside cause any creator and afterproposing this Hawking admitted that hewas still puzzled I mean he said youknow these are just this models justequations what breathes fired the intothe equations and creates the world forthem to describe he was puzzled by thisso equations themselves can't do themagic can't resolve the puzzle ofexistence and besides even if the lawscould do that why this set of laws whyquantum field theory that describes auniverse with a certain number of forcesand particles and so forth why not acompletely different set of laws thereare you know many many mathematicallyconsistent sets of laws why not no lawsat all why not sure nothingness so thisis a problem you know believe it or notthat reflective physicists really thinka lot about and at this point they tendto go metaphysical say well maybe thelaws that describe our universe it'sjust one set of laws and it describesone part of reality but maybe everyconsistent set of laws describes anotherpart of reality and in fact all possiblephysical worlds really exist they're allout there we just see a little tiny partof reality that's described by the lawsof quantum field theory but there aremany many other worlds parts of realitythat are described by vastly differenttheories that are different from ours inways we can't imagine that are you knowin conceivably exotic Stephen Weinbergthe father of the standard model ofparticle physics is actually flirtedwith this idea himself that all possiblerealities actually exist also a youngerphysicist max tegmark who believes thatthat all mathematical structures existand mathematical existence is the samething as physical existence so we havethis vastly rich multiverse thatencompasses every logical possibilitynow in taking this metaphysical way outthese physicists and also philosophersare actually reaching back to a very oldidea that goes back to Plato it's theprinciple of plentitude or fecundity orinto the great chain of being that thatreality is actually as full as possibleit's as far and move nothingness as itcould possibly be so we have these twoextremes now we have sheer nothingnesson one side and we have this vision of areality that encompasses everyconceivable world at the other extremethe fullest possible reality nothingnessthe simplest possible reality now what'sin between these two extremes there areall kinds of intermediate realities thatinclude some things and leave out othersso one of these intermediate realitiesis say the most the most elegant themost mathematically elegant reality thatleaves out the inelegant bits the theugly asymmetries and so forth nowthere's some physicists who will tellyou that we're actually living in themost elegant reality I I think thatBrian Green is in the audience and hehas written a book called thein universe he claims that the universewe live in mathematically is veryelegant don't believe himit's it's it's an ugly no it's a pioushope I wish that were true but I thinkthe other day he admitted to me it'sreally an ugly universe the the it'sstupidly constructed it's got way toomany arbitrary coupling constants andmass ratios and superfluous families ofelementary particles and what the hellis dark energy it's a it's a real it's astick and bubblegum can contraption it'snot an elegant universe and then thatthen there's the best of all possibleworlds in an ethical sense now youshould get some now because in you knowa world in which sentient beings don'tsuffer needlessly in which there aren'tthings like like childhood cancer or theHolocaust this is an ethical conceptionanyway so between nothingness and thefullest possible reality various specialrealities nothingness is special it'sthe simplest then there's the mostelegant possible reality that's specialthe fullest possible reality thatspecial but what are we leaving out herethere's also just the crummy genericrealities that aren't special in any waythat are sort of random they'reinfinitely removed from nothingness butthey fall infinitely short of completefullness they're a mixture of chaos andorder of mathematical elegance and anugliness that so they're you know Iwould describe these realities as anincomplete and infinitemediocre incomplete mess a genericreality a kind of cosmic junk shot andthese realities no is there a deity andmany of these realities maybe but thedeity isn't perfect like thejudeo-christian deity the deity isn'tall good and all-powerful it might beinstead 100% malevolent but only 80%effective which which pretty muchdescribes the world we see around us Ithink soso I would like to propose that theresolution to the mystery of existenceis that that our the reality we exist inis one of these generic realities nowreality has to turn out some way it caneither turn out to be nothing oreverything or something in between so ifit has some special feature like beingreally elegant or really full or reallysimple like nothingness that wouldrequire an explanation but if it's justone of these random generic realitiesthere's no further explanation for itand indeed I would say that's thereality we live in that's what scienceis telling us that's what at thebeginning of the week we got theexciting information that the theory ofinflation which predicts a big infinitekind of messy arbitrary pointlessreality it's like a big you knowfrothing ofchampagne coming out of a bottleendlessly a vast universe mostly awasteland with a little pockets of charmand order and peace you know that thisis this has been confirmed thisinflationary scenario by theobservations made by radio telescopes inAntarctica that looked at the signatureof the gravitational waves from the justbefore the Big Bang I'm sure you allknow about this so anyway I thinkthere's a little some evidence that thisreally is the reality that we're stuckwith now why should you care well wellthe the question why does the worldexist that's the causative question it'ssort of rhymes with a more intimatequestion why do I exist why do you existyou know our existence is really amazingwould seem to be amazingly improbablebecause there you know there's somethinglike there's an enormous number ofgenetically possible humans if you cancompute it by looking at the number ofgenes and the number of alleles and soforth and it's a back-of-the-envelopecalculation will tell you there about 10to the 10,000 possible humansgenetically that's between a googol anda googolplex so and the number of actualhumans have syste Dizz an infinite youknow 100 billion maybe 50 billion aninfinitesimal fraction so all of uswe've won this amazing cosmic lotterywe're here okay so what kind of realitydo we want to live in do welive in a special reality what if wewere living in the most elegant possiblereality what imagine the existentialpressure on us to live up to that youknow to be elegant not to pull down thetone of it or what if we were living inthe fullest possible reality well thenour existence would be guaranteedbecause every possible thing exists inthat reality but our choices would bemeaningless you know if I if I reallystruggle morally and agonize and Idecide to do the right thing whatdifference does make because they're ainfinite number of versions of me alsodoing the right thing and an infinitenumber doing the wrong thing so mychoices are meaningless so we don't wantto live in that special reality and asfor the special reality of nothingness Imean we wouldn't be having thisconversation so so okay so I thinkliving in a generic reality that'smediocreyou know they're they're nasty bits anice fit so we can make the nice bitsbigger and the nasty bits smaller andthat gives us a kind of purpose in lifeyou know the universe is absurd but wecan still construct a purpose and that'sa pretty good one and then the overallmeaty mediocrity of reality could haveresonates ciselywith a mediocrity we all feel in thecore of our being and I know you feel itI mean I know you all you're all specialbut you're still kind of secretlymediocre don't you think so anyway youmay you may say you know this puzzle ofmystery of existence it's just you knowsilly mystery mongering you're notastonished at the existence of theuniverse you and you're in good companyyou know Bertrand Russell said you knowI I should say the universe is justthere and that's all you know just abrute fact and my professor at columbiacity morgue investor a greatphilosophical wag when i said to himprofessor morgan master why is theresomething rather than nothing and hesaid oh even if there was nothing youstill wouldn't be satisfied so yeah sookay so you're not astonished you know Idon't care but I will tell you I'll tellI will tell you something to conclude Iguarantee you will astonish you becauseit's astonished all of the brilliantwonderful people I've met at this TEDconference when I told them and it'sthis never in my life have I had a cellphonethank you[Applause]",

   "transcription": "there's a man by the name of CaptainWilliam Swenson who recently was awardedthe Congressional Medal of Honor for hisactions on September 8 2009 on that daya column of American and Afghan troopswere making their way through a part ofAfghanistan to help protect a group ofgovernment officials a group of Afghangovernment officials who'd be meetingwith some local village elders thecolumn came under ambush and wassurrounded on three sides and amongstmany other things captain Swenson wasrecognized for running into live fire torescue the wounded and pull out the deadone of the people he rescued was asergeant and he and a comrade weremaking their way to a medevac helicopterand what was remarkable about this dayis by sheer coincidence one of themedevac medics happened to have a GoProcamera on his helmet and captured thewhole scene on camera it shows captainSwenson and his comrade bringing thiswounded soldier who received a gunshotto the neck they put him in thehelicopter and then you see captainSwenson bend over and give him a kissbefore he turns around to rescue more Isaw this and I thought to myself wheredo people like that come from what isthat that is some deep deep emotion whenyou would want to do that there'sthere's a there's a love there and Iwant to know why is it that I don't havepeople that I work with like that youknow in the military they give medals topeople who willing to sacrificethemselves that others may gain inbusiness we give bonuses to people whoare willing to sacrifice others so thatwe may gainyeah honey so I asked myself where dopeople like this come from and myinitial conclusion was that they're justbetter people that's why they'reattracted to the military these betterpeople are attracted to this concept ofservice but that's completely wrong whatI learned is that it's the environmentand if you get the environment rightevery single one of us has the capacityto do these remarkable things and moreimportantly others have that capacity toI've had the great honor of getting tomeet some of these who we would callheroes who've put themselves and puttheir lives at risk to save others and Iasked them why would you do it why didyou do it and they all say the samething because they would have done itfor me it's this deep sense of trust andcooperationso trust and cooperation are reallyimportant here the problem with conceptsof trust incorporation is that they arefeelings they're not instructionsI can't simply say to you trust me andyou will I can't simply instruct twopeople to cooperate and they will it'snot how it worksit's a feeling so where does thatfeeling come from if you go back 50,000years to the Paleolithic era to theearly days of Homo Sapien what we findis that the world was filled with dangerall of these forces working very veryhard to kill us nothing personalwhether it was the weather lack ofresources maybe a saber-toothed tigerall of these things working to reduceour lifespan and so we evolved intosocial animals where we live togetherand work together in what I call acircle of safety inside the tribe wherewe felt like we belong and when we feltsafe amongst our own the naturalreaction was trust in cooperation theirinherent benefits to this it means I canfall asleep at night and trust thatsomeone from within my tribe will watchfor danger if we don't trust each otherif I don't trust you that means youwon't watch for danger bad system ofsurvival the modern day is exactly thesame thing the world is filled withdanger things that are trying tofrustrate our lives or reduce oursuccess reduce our opportunity forsuccess it could be the ups and downs ofan economy the uncertainty of the stockmarketit could be a new technology thatrenders your business model obsoleteovernight or it could be yourcompetition that is sometimes trying tokill you it's sometimes trying to putyou out of business but at the veryminimum is working hard to frustrateyour growth and steal your business fromyou we have no control over these forcesthese are a constant and they're notgoing awaythe only variable are the conditionsinside the organization and that's whereleadership matters because it's theleader that sets the time when a leadermakes the choice to put the safety andlives of the people inside theorganization first to sacrifice theircomforts and sacrifice the tangibleresults so that the people remain andfeel safe they feel like they belongremarkable things happen I was flying ona trip and I was witness to an incidentwhere a passenger attempted to boardbefore their number was called and Iwatched the gate agent treat this manlike he had broken the law like acriminal who was yelled at forattempting to board one group too soonso I said something I said why why doyou have to treat us like cattle whycan't you treat us like human beings andthis is exactly what she said to me shesaid sir if I don't follow the rules Icould get in trouble or lose my job allshe was telling me is that she doesn'tfeel safe all she was telling me is thatshe doesn't trust her leaders the reasonwe like flying Southwest Airlines is notbecause they necessarily hire betterpeople it's because they don't feartheir leaders you see if the conditionsare wrong we're forced to expend our owntime and energy to protect ourselvesfrom each other and that inherentlyweakens the organization when we feelsafe inside the organization we willnaturally combine our talents and ourstrengths and work tirelessly to facethe dangers outside and seize theopportunities the closest analogy I cangive to what a great leader is it's likebeing a parent if you think about whatbeing a great parent is what do you wantwhat makes a great parent we want togive our child opportunities educationdiscipline themnecessary also that they can grow up andachieve more than we could for ourselvesgreat leaders want exactly the samething they want to provide their peopleopportunity education discipline whennecessary build their self-confidencegive them the opportunity to try andfail all so that they could achieve morethan we could ever imagine for ourselvesCharlie Kim who's the CEO of a companycalled next jump in New York City a techcompany he makes the point that if youhad hard times in your family would youever consider laying off one of yourchildren we would never do it then whydo we consider laying off people insideour organizationCharlie implemented a policy of lifetimeemployment if you get a job at next jumpyou cannot get fired for performanceissues in fact if you have issues theywill coach you and they will give yousupport just like we would with one ofour children who happens to come homewith a C from school it's the completeopposite this is the reason so manypeople have such a visceral hatred thiscan sort of anger at some of thesebanking CEOs with their disproportionatesalaries and bonus structures it's notthe numbers it's that they have violatedthe very definition of leadership theyhave violated this deep-seated socialcontract we know that they allowed theirpeople to be sacrificed that they couldprotect their own interests or worsethey sacrificed their people to protecttheir own interests this is what sooffends us not the numbers would anybodybe offended if we gave 150 milliondollar bonus to Gandhi how about a twohundred and fifty million dollar bonus -mother Teresa do we have an issue withthatnone at all none at all great leaderswould never sacrifice the people to savethe numbers they would sooner sacrificethe numbers to save the people BobChapman who runs a large manufacturingcompany in the Midwest calledbarry-wehmiller in 2008 who was hit veryhard by the recession and they lost 30%of their orders overnight now in a largemanufacturing company this isn't this isa big deal and they could no longerafford their lay their labor pool theyneeded to save 10 million dollars solike so many companies today the boardgottogether and discussed layoffs and bobrefused you see bob doesn't believe inhead counts bob believes in heart countsand it's much more difficult to simplyreduce the heart count and so they cameup with a furlough program everyemployee from secretary to CEO wasrequired to take four weeks of unpaidvacation they could take it anytime theywanted and they did not have to take itconsecutively but it was how bobannounced the program that mattered somuch he said it's better that we shouldall suffer a little than any of usshould have to suffer a lot and moralewent up they saved twenty milliondollars and most importantly as he'd beexpected when the people feel safe andprotected by the leadership in theorganization the natural reaction is totrust and cooperate and quitespontaneously nobody expected peoplestarted trading with each other thosewho could afford it more would tradewith those who could afford it lesspeople would take five weeks so thatsomebody else only had to take threeleadership is a choice it is not a rankI know many people at the senior mostlevels of organizations who areabsolutely not leaders they areauthorities and we do what they saybecause they have authority over us butwe would not follow them and I know manypeople who are the bottoms oforganizations who have no authority andthey are absolutely leaders and this isbecause they have chosen to look afterthe person to the left of them and theyhave chosen to look after the person tothe right of them this is what a leaderis I heard a story of some marines whowere out in theater and as is the marinecustom the officer ate last and he lethis men eat first and when they weredone there was no food left for him andwhen they went back out in the field hismen brought him some of their food sothat he made because that's what happenswe call them leaders because they gofirstwe call them leaders becausetake the risk before anybody else doeswe call them leaders because they willchoose to sacrifice so that their peoplemay be safe and protected and so histheir people may gain and when we do thenatural response is that our people willsacrifice for us they will give us theirblood and sweat and tears to see thattheir leaders vision comes to life andwhen we ask them why would you do thatwhy would you give your blood and sweatand tears for that person they all saythe same thing because they would havedone it for me and isn't that theorganization we would all like to workin thank you very much[Applause]",

   "publishedAt": "03 Jun 2019",
   "transcription": "thank you very much um well I would liketo start with testicles men who sleepfive hours a night have significantlysmaller testicles than those who sleepseven hours or more in addition men whoroutinely sleep just four to five hoursa night will have a level oftestosterone which is that of someoneten years their senior so a lack ofsleep will age a man by a decade interms of that critical aspect ofwellness and we see equivalentimpairments in female reproductivehealth caused by a lack of sleep this isthe best news that I have for you todayfrom this point it may only get worsenot only will I tell you about thewonderfully good things that happen whenyou get sleep but the alarmingly badthings that happen when you don't getenough both for your brain and for yourbody um let me start with the brain andthe functions of learning and memorybecause what we've discovered over thepast 10 or so years is that you needsleep after learning to essentially hitthe Save button on those new memories sothat you don't forget but recently wediscovered that you also need sleepbefore learning and now to actuallyprepare your brain almost like a drysponge ready to initially soak up newinformation and without sleep the memorycircuits of the brain essentially becomewaterlogged as it were and you can'tabsorb new memories so let me show youthe data here in this study we decidedto test the hypothesis that pulling theall-nighter was a good idea so we took agroup of individuals and we assignedthem to one of two experimental groups asleep group and a sleep deprivationgroup now the sleep group they're goingto get a full eight hours of slumber butthe deprivation group we're going tokeep them awake in the laboratory underfull supervisionthere's no naps or caffeine by the wayso it's miserable for everyone involvedand then the next day we're going toplace those participants inside an MRIscanner I'm going to have them try andlearn a whole list of new facts as we'retaking snapshots of brain activity andthen we're going to test them to see howeffective that learning has been andthat's what you're looking at here onthe vertical axis and when you put thosetwo groups head-to-head what you find isa quite significant 40 percent deficitin the ability of the brain to make newmemories without sleep I think thisshould be concerning considering what weknow is happening to sleep in oureducation populations right nowin fact to put that in context it wouldbe the difference in a child acing anexam versus failing it miserably 40% andwe've gone on to discover what goeswrong within your brain to produce thesetypes of learning disabilities andthere's a structure that sits on theleft and the right side of your braincalled the hippocampus and you can thinkof the hippocampus almost like theinformational inbox of your brain it'svery good at receiving new memory filesand then holding on to them and when youlook at this structure in those peoplewho'd had a full night of sleep we sawlots of healthy learning relatedactivity yet in those people who aresleep deprived we actually couldn't findany significant signal whatsoever soit's almost as though sleep deprivationhad shut down your memory inbox and anynew incoming files they were just beingbounced you couldn't effectively commityour experiences to memory so that's thebad that can happen if I were to takesleep away from you but let me just comeback to that control group for a secondremember those folks that got a fulleight hours of sleep well we can ask avery different question what is it aboutthe physiological quality of your sleepwhen you do get it that restores andenhances your memory and learningability each and every day and byplacing electrodes all over the headwhat we've discovered is that there arebig powerful brain waves that happenduring the very deepest stages of sleepthat have riding on top of them thesespectacular bursts of electricalactivity that we call sleep spindles andit's the combined quality of these deepsleep brain waves that acts like a filetransfer mechanism at nightshifting memories from a short-termvulnerable reservoir to a more permanentlong-term storage site within the brainand therefore protectding them making them safe and it isimportant that we understand what duringsleep actually transacts these memorybenefits because there are real medicaland societal implications and let mejust tell you about one area that we'vemoved this work out into clinicallywhich is the context of Aging anddementia because it's of course nosecret that as we get older our learningand memory abilities begin to fade anddecline but what we've also discoveredis that a physiological signature ofaging is that your sleep gets worseespecially that deep quality of sleepthat I was just discussing and only lastyear we finally published evidence thatthese two things they're not simplyco-occurring they are significantlyinterrelated and it suggests that thedisruption of deep sleep is anunderappreciated factor that iscontributing to cognitive decline ormemory decline in ageing and mostrecently we've discovered in Alzheimer'sdisease as well now I know this isremarkably depressing news it's in themail it's coming at you but there's apotential silver lining here unlike manyof the other factors that we know areassociated with aging for examplechanges in the physical structure of thebrain that's fiendishly difficult totreat but that sleep is a missing piecein the explanatory puzzle of Aging inAlzheimer's is exciting because we maybe able to do something about it and oneway that we are approaching this at mysleep center is not by using sleepingpills by the way unfortunately they areblunt instruments that do not producenaturalistic sleep instead we'reactually developing a method based onthis it's called direct current brainstimulation you insert a small amount ofvoltage into the brain so small youtypically don't feel it but it has ameasurable impactnow if you apply this stimulation duringsleep in young healthy adults as ifyou're sort of singing in time withthose deep sleep brainwaves not only canyou amplify the size of those deep sleepbrainwaves but in doing so we can almostdouble the amount of memory benefit thatyou get from sleep the question now iswhether we can translate this sameaffordable potentially portable piece oftechnology into older adults and thosewith dementia can we restore back somehealthy quality of deep sleep and indoing so can we salvage aspects of theirlearning and memory function that is myreal hope now that's one of our moonshotgoals as it were so that's an example ofsleep for your brain but sleep is justas essential for your body and we'vealready spoken about sleep loss and yourreproductive system or I could tell youabout sleep loss and your cardiovascularsystem and that all it takes is one hourbecause there is a global experimentperformed on 1.6 billion people across70 countries twice a year and it'scalled daylight savings time now in thespring when we lose one hour of sleep wesee a subsequent 24 percent increase inheart attacks that following day in theautumn when we gain an hour of sleep wesee a 21 percent reduction in heartattacks it's not that incredible and yousee exactly the same profile for carcrashes road traffic accidents evensuicide rates but as a deeper dive Iwant to focus on this sleep loss andyour immune system and here I'llintroduce these delightful blue elementsin the image they are called napall killer cells and you can think ofnatural killer cells almost like theSecret Service agents of your immunesystem and they are very good atidentifying dangerous unwanted elementsand eliminating them in fact whatthey're doing here is destroying acancerous tumor mass so what you wishfor is a variety of these immuneassassins at all times and tragicallythat's what you don't have if you're notsleeping enough so here in thisexperiment you're not going to have yoursleep deprived for an entire night yousimply go to have your sleep restrictedto four hours for one single night andthen we're going to look to see what'sthe percent reduction in immune cellactivity that you suffer and it's notsmall it's not ten percent it's nottwenty percent there was a 70% drop innatural killer cell activity that's aconcerning stage of immune deficiencyand you can perhaps understand why we'renow finding significant links betweenshort sleep duration and your risk forthe development of numerous forms ofcancer currently that list includescancer of the bowel cancer of theprostate and cancer of the breastin fact the link between a lack of sleepand cancer is now so strong that theWorld Health Organization has classifiedany form of nighttime shiftwork as aprobable carcinogen because of adisruption of your sleep wake rhythms soyou may have heard of that old maximthat you can sleep when you're deadwell and being quite serious now it ismortally unwise advice we know this fromepidemiological studies across millionsof individuals there's a simple truththe shorter your sleepthe shorter your life short sleeppredicts all cause mortalityand if increasing your risk for thedevelopment of cancer or evenAlzheimer's disease were notsufficiently I'm disquieting we havesince discovered that a lack of sleepwill even erode the very fabric ofbiological life itselfyour DNA genetic code so here in thisstudy they took a group of healthyadults and they limited them to sixhours of sleep a night for one week andthen they measured the change in theirgene activity profile relative to whenthose same individuals were getting afull eight hours of sleep per night andthere were two critical findings first asizable and significant 711 genes weredistorted in their activity caused by alack of sleep the second result was thatabout half of those genes were actuallyincreased in their activity the otherhalf were decreased now those genes thatwere switched off by a lack of sleepwere genes associated with your immunesystem so once again you can see thatimmune deficiency in contrast thosegenes that were actually up regulated orincreased by way of a lack of sleep weregenes associated with a promotion oftumors genes associated with long termchronic inflammation within the body andgenes associated with stress and as aconsequence cardiovascular disease thereis simply no aspect of your wellnessthat can retreat at the sign of sleepdeprivation and get away unscathed it'srather like a broken water pipe in yourhome sleep loss will leak down intoevery nook and cranny of your physiologyeven tampering with the very DNA nucleicalphabet that spells out your dailyhealth narrative and at this point youmay be thinking oh my goodness how do Istart to get better sleep what are yourtipsfor good sleep well beyond avoiding thedamaging and harmful impact of alcoholand caffeine on sleep and if you'restruggling with sleep at night avoidingnaps during the day I have two pieces ofadvice for youthe first is regularity go to bed at thesame time wake up at the same time nomatter whether it's the weekday or theweekend regularity is king and it willanchor your sleep and improve thequantity and the quality of that sleepthe second is keep it cool your bodyneeds to drop its core temperature byabout 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit toinitiate sleep and then to stay asleepand it's the reason you will always findit easier to fall asleep in a roomthat's too cold than too hot so aim fora bedroom temperature of around 65degrees or about 18 degrees Celsiusthat's going to be optimal for the sleepof most people and then finally intaking a step back then what is themission critical statement here well Ithink it may be this sleep unfortunatelyis not an optional lifestyle luxurysteep is a non-negotiablebiological necessity it is your lifesupport system and it is mother nature'sbest effort yet at immortality and thedecimation of sleep throughoutindustrialized nations is having acatastrophic impact on our health orwellness even the safety and theeducation of our children it's a silentsleep loss epidemic and it is fastbecoming one of the greatest publichealth challenges that we face in the21st century I believe it is now timefor us to reclaim our right to a fullnight of sleep and without embarrassmentor that unfortunate stigma of lazinessand in doing so we can be reunited withthe most powerful elixir of life theSwiss Army knife of health as it wereand with that soap box rant over I willsimply say good night good luck andabove all I do hope you sleep well thankyou very much indeed thank youthank you so much no no no stay therefor a second job not running away thoughI appreciate thatso that was terrifying you're welcomeyes thank you thank you since we can'tcatch up on sleep what are we supposedto do what do we do when we're liketossing and turning in bed late at nightor doing shift work or whatever else soyou're right we can't catch up on sleepsleep is not like the bankyou can't accumulate a debt and thenhope to pay it off at a later point intimeI should also know the reason that it'sso catastrophic about our healthdeteriorate so quickly first is becausehuman beings are the only species thatdeliberately deprive themselves of sleepfor no apparent reason as we're smartand well and I make that point becausewhat it means is that mother naturethroughout the course of evolution hasnever had to face the challenge of thisthing called sleep deprivation so she'snever developed a safety net and that'swhy when you understood of implode soquickly both within the brain in thebody so you just have to prioritize okayso but tossing and turning in bed whatdo I doso if you are staying in bed awake fortoo long you should get out of bed andgo to a different room and do somethingdifferent the reason is because yourbrain will very quickly associate yourbedroom with the place of wakefulnessand you need to break that Associationso only return to bed when you aresleepy and that way you will relearn theAssociation that you once had which isyour bed is the place of sleep so theanalogy would be you'd never sit at thedinner table waiting to get hungry sowhy would you lie in bed waiting to getsleeping all right well thank you forthat wake-up call great job man verywelcome thank you very much",

one daystood on a box put a hat or a can at myfeetand when someone came by and dropped inmoney i handed thema flower and someintense eye contactand if they didn't take the flower ithrew in a gestureof sadness and longing as they walkedawayso i had the most profound encounterswith people especially lonely people wholooked like they hadn't talked to anyonein weeks and we would get this beautifulmoment of prolonged eye contact beingallowedin a city street and we would sort offall in love a little bitand my eyes would say thank youi see you and their eyes would saynobody ever sees me thank youand i would get harassed sometimespeople would yell at me from theirpassing cards get a joband i'd be like this is my jobum but it hurt because it made mefear that i was somehow doing somethingunjob-likeand unfair shamefuli had no idea how perfecta real education i was getting for themusic business on this boxand for the economists out there you maybe interested to know i actually made apretty predictable incomewhich was shocking to me given i had noregular customers but pretty much60 bucks on a tuesday 90 bucks on afriday it was consistentand meanwhile i was touring locally andplaying in nightclubs with my band thedresden dolls this was me on piano agenius drummeri wrote the songs and eventually westarted making enough money that i couldquitbeing a statue and as we started touringi really didn't want to lose this senseof directconnection with people because i lovedit so afterall of our shows we would signautographs and hugfans and hang out and talk to people andwe made an art out of asking people tohelp usand join us and i would track down localmusiciansand artists and they would set upoutside of our shows and they would passthe hat and then they would come in andjoin us on stage so we had thisrotating smorgasbord of weird randomcircus guestsand then twitter came along and madethings even more magic because i couldaskinstantly for anything anywhere so iwould need a piano to practice on and anhour later i would be at a fan's housethis is in londonpeople would bring home-cooked food tous all over the world backstage and feedus and eat with us this is in seattlefans who worked in museums and storesand and any kind of public space wouldwave their handsif i would decide to do a last minutespontaneous free gigthis is a library in aucklandon saturday i tweeted for this crate andhat because i did not want to schlepthem from the east coast and they showedup care of this dude chris from newportbeachwho says hello i once tweeted where inmelbourne can i buya neti pot and a nurse from a hospitaldrove oneright at that moment to the cafe i wasin and i bought her a smoothie and wesat there talking about nursing anddeath and i love this kind of randomcloseness which is lucky because i do alot of couchsurfingin mansions where everyone in my crewgets their own room but there's nowirelessand in punk squats everyone on the floorin one room with no toiletsbut with wireless clearly making it thebetter optionmy crew once pulled our van up to areallypoor miami neighborhood and we found outthat our couchsurfing host for the nightwas an 18 year old girl still living athome and her family were allundocumented immigrants from hondurasand that night her whole familytook the couches and she slept togetherwith her momso that we could take their beds and ilay there thinkingthese people have so little is this fairand in the morning her mom taught us howto try to make tortillas and wanted togive me a bibleand she took me aside and she said to mein her broken englishyour music has helped my daughterso much thank you for staying herewe're all so grateful and i thoughtthis is fair this isthis a couple months lateri was in manhattan and i tweeted for acrash padand at midnight i'm ringing a doorbellon the lower east side and it occurs tome i've never actually done this alonei've always been with my band or my crewis what stupid people dois this how stupid people die and beforei can change my mind the door bus openshe's an artist he's a financial bloggerfor reutersand they're pouring me a glass of redwine and offering me a bath and i havehadthousands of nights like that and likethatso i couch surf a lot i also crowd surfa lot i maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfing are basicallythe same thing you're falling into theaudienceand you're trusting each other i onceaskedan opening band of mine if they wantedto go out into the crowd and pass thehat to get themselves some extramoney something that i did a lot and asusual the band was psyched but there wasthis one guy in the bandwho told me he just couldn't bringhimself to go out thereit felt too much like begging to standtherewith the hat and i recognized hisfear of is this fairand get a job andmeanwhile my band is becoming bigger andbigger we sign with a major labeland our music is a cross between punkand cabaret it's not for everybodybut well maybe it's for youwe sign and our there's all this hypeleading up to our next recordand it comes out and it sells about 25000 copiesin the first few weeks and the labelconsiders thisa failure and i was like 25 000 isn'tthat a lot they're like nothe sales are going down it's a failureand they walk offright at the same time i'm signing andhugging after a gigand a guy comes up to me and hands me a10 billand he says i'm sorry i burned your cdfrom a friendi but i i read your blog i know you hateyour label i just want you to have thismoneyand this starts happening all the timei become the hat after my own gigs but ihave to physically stand there and takethe help from peopleand unlike the guy in the opening bandi've actually had a lot of practicestanding there thank youand this is the moment i decide i'm justgoing to give away my musicfor free online whenever possible soit's like metallica over herenapster bad amanda palmer over here andi'm going to encouragetorrenting downloading sharing but i'mgoing to askfor help because i saw it work on thestreetso i fought my way off my label and formy next project with my new band thegrand theft orchestrai turned to crowdfunding and ifell into those thousands of connectionsthat i'd madeand i asked my crowd to catch meand the goal was a hundred thousanddollars my fans backed me at nearly 1.2million which was the biggest musiccrowdfunding project to dateand you can see how many people it isit's about 25 000 peopleand the media asked amanda the musicbusiness is tanking and you encouragepiracy how do you make all these peoplepay for musicand the real answer is i didn't makethemi asked them and through the very actof asking people i'd connected with themand when you connect with them peoplewantto help you it's kind ofcounterintuitive for a lot of artiststhey don't want to ask for thingsbut it's not it's not easyit's not easy to ask and a lot ofartists have a problem with thisasking makes you vulnerable andi got a lot of criticism onlineafter my kickstarter went big forcontinuing my crazy crowdsourcingpracticesspecifically for asking musicians whowere fans if they wanted to join us onstage for a few songs in exchange forlove and tickets and beer andthis was a doctored image that went upof meon a website and this hurt in a reallyfamiliar way and people sayingyou're not allowed anymore to ask forthat kind of helpreally reminded me of the people intheir cars yelling get a jobbecause they weren't with us on thesidewalkand they couldn't see the exchange thatwas happening between meand my crowd an exchange that was veryfair to usbut alien to them[Music]this is slightly not safer work this ismy kickstarter backer party in berlin atthe end of the night i stripped and leteveryone draw on menow let me tell you if you want toexperience the visceral feeling oftrusting strangersi recommend this especially if thosestrangers are drunk german peoplethis was a ninja master level fanconnection because what i was reallysaying here wasi trust you this much should ishow me for most of human historymusicians artists they've been part ofthe communityconnectors and and openers notuntouchable starscelebrity is about a lot of peopleloving you from a distancebut the internet and the content thatwe're freelyable to share on it are taking us backit's about a few people loving you upclose and about those peoplebeing enough so a lot of people areconfused by the idea of no hard stickerprice they see it as an unpredictablerisk but the thingsi've done the kickstarter the street thedoorbelli don't see these things as risk i seethem as trustnow the online tools to make theexchangeas easy and as instinctive as the streetthey're getting there but the perfecttools aren't going to help usif we can't face each other and giveand receive fearlessly but moreimportantto ask without shamemy music career has been spent trying toencounter peopleon the internet the way i could on theboxso blogging and tweeting not just aboutmytour dates and my new video but aboutour work and our artand our fears our hangoversour mistakes and we see each otherand i think when we really see eachotherwe want to help each otheri think people have been obsessed withthe wrong questionwhich is how do we make people pay formusicwhat if we started asking how do we letpeople pay for musicthank youyou",

   "title": "Your kids might live on Mars. Here's how they'll survive | Stephen Petranek",
   "publishedAt": "05 May 2016",
   "transcription": "Strap yourselves in,we're going to Mars.Not just a few astronauts --thousands of peopleare going to colonize Mars.And I am telling youthat they're going to do this soon.Some of you will end upworking on projects on Mars,and I guarantee that someof your children will end up living there.That probably sounds preposterous,so I'm going to share with youhow and when that will happen.But first I want to discussthe obvious question:Why the heck should we do this?12 years ago,I gave a TED talk on 10 waysthe world could end suddenly.We are incredibly vulnerableto the whims of our own galaxy.A single, large asteroidcould take us out forever.To survive we have to reachbeyond the home planet.Think what a tragedy it would beif all that humans have accomplishedwere suddenly obliterated.And there's another reason we should go:exploration is in our DNA.Two million years agohumans evolved in Africaand then slowly but surelyspread out across the entire planetby reaching into the wildernessthat was beyond their horizons.This stuff is inside us.And they prospered doing that.Some of the greatest advancesin civilization and technologycame because we explored.Yes, we could do a lot of goodwith the money it will taketo establish a thriving colony on Mars.And yes we should all be takingfar better care of our own home planet.And yes, I worry we could screw up Marsthe way we've screwed up Earth.But think for a moment,what we had when John F. Kennedytold us we would put a human on the moon.He excited an entire generation to dream.Think how inspired we will beto see a landing on Mars.Perhaps then we will look back at Earthand see that that isone people instead of manyand perhaps thenwe will look back at Earth,as we struggle to survive on Mars,and realize how preciousthe home planet is.So let me tell you about the extraordinaryadventure we're about to undertake.But first,a few fascinating factsabout where we're going.This picture actually representsthe true size of Mars compared to Earth.Mars is not our sister planet.It's far less than halfthe size of the Earth,and yet despite the factthat it's smaller,the surface area of Marsthat you can stand onis equivalent to the surface areaof the Earth that you can stand on,because the Earthis mostly covered by water.The atmosphere on Mars is really thin --100 times thinner than on Earth --and it's not breathable,it's 96 percent carbon dioxide.It's really cold there.The average temperatureis minus 81 degrees,although there isquite a range of temperature.A day on Mars is about as longas a day on Earth,plus about 39 minutes.Seasons and years on Marsare twice as long as they are on Earth.And for anybody who wants to strapon some wings and go flying one day,Mars has a lot less gravity than on Earth,and it's the kind of placewhere you can jump over your carinstead of walk around it.Now, as you can see,Mars isn't exactly Earth-like,but it's by far the most livableother place in our entire solar system.Here's the problem.Mars is a long way away,a thousand times farther awayfrom us than our own moon.The Moon is 250,000 miles awayand it took Apollo astronautsthree days to get there.Mars is 250 million miles awayand it will take useight months to get there --240 days.And that's only if we launchon a very specific day,at a very specific time,once every two years,when Mars and the Earthare aligned just so,so the distance that the rocketwould have to travel will be the shortest.240 days is a long time to spendtrapped with your colleagues in a tin can.And meanwhile, our track recordof getting to Mars is lousy.We and the Russians,the Europeans, the Japanese,the Chinese and the Indians,have actually sent 44 rockets there,and the vast majority of themhave either missed or crashed.Only about a third of the missionsto Mars have been successful.And we don't at the moment havea rocket big enough to get there anyway.We once had that rocket, the Saturn V.A couple of Saturn Vswould have gotten us there.It was the most magnificentmachine ever built by humans,and it was the rocketthat took us to the Moon.But the last Saturn V was used in 1973to launch the Skylab space station,and we decided to dosomething called the shuttleinstead of continuing on to Marsafter we landed on the Moon.The biggest rocket we have nowis only half big enoughto get us anything to Mars.So getting to Mars is not going to be easyand that brings upa really interesting question ...how soon will the first humansactually land here?Now, some pundits thinkif we got there by 2050,that'd be a pretty good achievement.These days, NASA seems to be sayingthat it can get humans to Mars by 2040.Maybe they can.I believe that they can gethuman beings into Mars orbit by 2035.But frankly,I don't think they're going to botherin 2035 to send a rocket to Mars,because we will already be there.We're going to land on Mars in 2027.And the reason isthis man is determinedto make that happen.His name is Elon Musk,he's the CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX.Now, he actually told methat we would land on Mars by 2025,but Elon Musk is moreoptimistic than I am --and that's going a ways --so I'm giving hima couple of years of slack.Still ...you've got to ask yourself,can this guy really do thisby 2025 or 2027?Well, let's put a decade with Elon Muskinto a little perspective.Where was this 10 years ago?That's the Tesla electric automobile.In 2005, a lot of peoplein the automobile industry were saying,we would not havea decent electric car for 50 years.And where was that?That is SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket,lifting six tons of suppliesto the International Space Station.10 years ago,SpaceX had not launched anything,or fired a rocket to anywhere.So I think it's a pretty good betthat the person who is revolutionizingthe automobile industryin less than 10 yearsand the person who created an entirerocket company in less than 10 yearswill get us to Mars by 2027.Now, you need to know this:governments and robotsno longer control this game.Private companies are leaping into spaceand they will be happyto take you to Mars.And that raises a really big question.Can we actually live there?Now, NASA may not be ableto get us there until 2040,or we may get therea long time before NASA,but NASA has taken a huge responsibilityin figuring out how we can live on Mars.Let's look at the problem this way.Here's what you need to live on Earth:food, water, shelter and clothing.And here's what you need to live on Mars:all of the above, plus oxygen.So let's look at the mostimportant thing on this list first.Water is the basisof all life as we know it,and it's far too heavy for us to carrywater from the Earth to Mars to live,so we have to find waterif our life is going to succeed on Mars.And if you look at Mars,it looks really dry,it looks like the entireplanet is a desert.But it turns out that it's not.The soil alone on Marscontains up to 60 percent water.And a number of orbiters that we stillhave flying around Mars have shown us --and by the way,that's a real photograph --that lots of craters on Marshave a sheet of water ice in them.It's not a bad place to start a colony.Now, here's a view of a little digthe Phoenix Lander did in 2008,showing that just belowthe surface of the soil is ice --that white stuff is ice.In the second picture,which is four days laterthan the first picture,you can see thatsome of it is evaporating.Orbiters also tell usthat there are huge amountsof underground water on Marsas well as glaciers.In fact, if only the water iceat the poles on Mars melted,most of the planetwould be under 30 feet of water.So there's plenty of water there,but most of it's ice,most of it's underground,it takes a lot of energy to get itand a lot of human labor.This is a device cooked upat the University of Washingtonback in 1998.It's basically a low-tech dehumidifier.And it turns out the Mars atmosphereis often 100 percent humid.So this device can extractall the water that humans will needsimply from the atmosphere on Mars.Next we have to worryabout what we will breathe.Frankly, I was really shockedto find out that NASAhas this problem worked out.This is a scientist at MITnamed Michael Hecht.And he's developed this machine, Moxie.I love this thing.It's a reverse fuel cell, essentially,that sucks in the Martian atmosphereand pumps out oxygen.And you have to remember that CO2 --carbon dioxide, which is96 percent of Mars' atmosphere --CO2 is basically 78 percent oxygen.Now, the next big roverthat NASA sends to Mars in 2020is going to have oneof these devices aboard,and it will be ableto produce enough oxygento keep one person alive indefinitely.But the secret to this --and that's just for testing --the secret to this is that this thingwas designed from the get-goto be scalable by a factor of 100.Next, what will we eat?Well, we'll use hydroponics to grow food,but we're not going to be able to growmore than 15 to 20 percentof our food there,at least not until water is runningon the surface of Marsand we actually have the probabilityand the capability of planting crops.In the meantime,most of our food will arrive from Earth,and it will be dried.And then we need some shelter.At first we can use inflatable,pressurized buildingsas well as the landers themselves.But this really only worksduring the daytime.There is too much solar radiationand too much radiation from cosmic rays.So we really have to go underground.Now, it turns out that the soil on Mars,by and large,is perfect for making bricks.And NASA has figured this one out, too.They're going to throwsome polymer plastic into the bricks,shove them in a microwave oven,and then you will be able to buildbuildings with really thick walls.Or we may choose to live undergroundin caves or in lava tubes,of which there are plenty.And finally there's clothing.On Earth we have milesof atmosphere piled up on us,which creates 15 pounds of pressureon our bodies at all times,and we're constantlypushing out against that.On Mars there's hardlyany atmospheric pressure.So Dava Newman,a scientist at MIT,has created this sleek space suit.It will keep us together,block radiation and keep us warm.So let's think about this for a minute.Food, shelter, clothing, water, oxygen ...we can do this.We really can.But it's still a little complicatedand a little difficult.So that leads to the next big --really big step --in living the good life on Mars.And that's terraforming the planet:making it more like Earth,reengineering an entire planet.That sounds like a lot of hubris,but the truth isthat the technology to do everythingI'm about to tell you already exists.First we've got to warm it up.Mars is incredibly coldbecause it has a very thin atmosphere.The answer lies here, at the south poleand at the north pole of Mars,both of which are coveredwith an incredible amountof frozen carbon dioxide --dry ice.If we heat it up,it sublimes directly into the atmosphereand thickens the atmospherethe same way it does on Earth.And as we know,CO2 is an incrediblypotent greenhouse gas.Now, my favorite way of doing thisis to erect a very, very large solar sailand focus it --it essentially serves as a mirror --and focus it on the south poleof Mars at first.As the planet spins, it will heat upall that dry ice, sublime it,and it will go into the atmosphere.It actually won't take longfor the temperatureon Mars to start rising,probably less than 20 years.Right now,on a perfect day at the equator,in the middle of summer on Mars,temperatures canactually reach 70 degrees,but then they go downto minus 100 at night.(Laughter)What we're shooting foris a runaway greenhouse effect:enough temperature riseto see a lot of that ice on Mars --especially the ice in the ground -- melt.Then we get some real magic.As the atmosphere gets thicker,everything gets better.We get more protection from radiation,more atmosphere makes us warmer,makes the planet warmer,so we get running waterand that makes crops possible.Then more water vapor goes into the air,forming yet another potent greenhouse gas.It will rain and it will snow on Mars.And a thicker atmospherewill create enough pressureso that we canthrow away those space suits.We only need about five poundsof pressure to survive.Eventually, Mars will be madeto feel a lot like British Columbia.We'll still be leftwith the complicated problemof making the atmosphere breathable,and frankly that could take1,000 years to accomplish.But humans are amazingly smartand incredibly adaptable.There is no telling what our futuretechnology will be able to accomplishand no telling what we can dowith our own bodies.In biology right now,we are on the very verge of beingable to control our own genetics,what the genesin our own bodies are doing,and certainly,eventually, our own evolution.We could end up with a speciesof human being on Earththat is slightly differentfrom the species of human beings on Mars.But what would you do there?How would you live?It's going to bethe same as it is on Earth.Somebody's going to start a restaurant,somebody's going to build an iron foundry.Someone will makedocumentary movies of Marsand sell them on Earth.Some idiot will start a reality TV show.(Laughter)There will be software companies,there will be hotels, there will be bars.This much is certain:it will be the most disruptiveevent in our lifetimes,and I think it will be the most inspiring.Ask any 10-year-old girlif she wants to go to Mars.Children who are now in elementary schoolare going to choose to live there.Remember when we landedhumans on the Moon?When that happened,people looked at each other and said,\"If we can do this, we can do anything.\"What are they going to thinkwhen we actually form a colony on Mars?Most importantly,it will make us a spacefaring species.And that means humans will surviveno matter what happens on Earth.We will never be the last of our kind.Thank you.(Applause)",

   "publishedAt": "18 Sep 2009",
   "transcription": "[Music]we see with the eyes but we see with thebrain as well and seeing with the brainis often called imagination and we arefamiliar with the landscapes of our ownimagination our in scapes we've livedwith them all our lives but there arealso hallucinations as well andhallucinations are completely differentthey don't seem to be of our creationthey don't seem to be under control theyseem to come from the outside and tomimic perception so I'm going to betalking about hallucinations and aparticular sort of visual hallucinationwhich I see among my patients a fewmonths ago I got a phone call from anursing home where I work they told methat one of their residents an old ladyin her 90s was seeing things and theywondered if she'd gone bonkers orbecause she was an old lady whether shehad had a stroke or whether she hadAlzheimer's and so um they asked me if Iwould come and see Rosaliethe old lady I went in to see her it wasevident straightaway that she wasperfectly sane and lucid and of goodintelligence but she'd been verystartled and very bewildered book shebeen seeing things and she told me thenurses hadn't mentioned this that shewas blind that she had been completelyblind for macular degeneration for fiveyears but now for the last few daysshe'd been seeing things so I said whatsorts of things and she said people inEastern dress and drapes walking up anddown stairs a man who turns towards meand smiles but he has huge teeth on oneside of his mouth animals too I see awhite building at snowing a softno I see this horse with a harnessdragging the snow away then one nightthe scene changes I see cats and dogswalking towards me they come to acertain point and then stop then itchanges again I see a lot of childrenthere walking up and down stairs theywear bright colors rose and blue likeEastern dress sometimes she said beforethe people come onshe may hallucinate pink and bluesquares on the floor which seemed to goup to the ceilingso I said is this like a dream and shesaid no it's not like a dream it's it'slike a movie she said that Scott colorhas got motion but it's completelysilent like a silent movie and she saidit was a rather boring movie she saidall these people with the Eastern dresswalking up and down very very repetitivevery limitedand she she had a sense of humor sheknew it was a hallucination but she wasfrightened she'd lived 95 years andshe'd never had a hallucination beforeshe said that the hallucinations wereunrelated to anything she was thinkingor feeling or doing that they seemed tocome on by themselves or disappear shehad no control over them she said shedidn't recognize any of the people orplaces in the hallucinations and none ofthe people of the animals well they allseemed oblivious of her and she didn'tknow what was going on she wondered ifshe was going mad or losing her mindwell I examined her carefully she was abright old lady perfectly sane she hadno medical problems she wasn't on anymedications which could producehallucinations but she was blind and Ithen said to her I think I know what youhave I said there is a special form ofvisual hallucination which may go withdeteriorating vision or blindness thiswas originally described I said rightback in the 18th century by a man calledCharles bonny and you have CharlesBonnie syndrome there's nothing wrongwith your brain there's nothing wrongwith your mind you have Charles Bonetsyndrome and she was very relieved atthis that was nothing seriously thematter and also rather curious she saidum who is the shuls Bonnie she said didhe have them himself and she said umtell all the nurses that I have Charlesbonnet syndromenot crazy I'm not demented I haveCharles bonnet syndromewell so I did tell the nurses now thisfor me is a common situation I work onold-age homes largely I see a lot ofelderly people who are hearing impairedor visually impaired about 10% of thehearing impaired people get musicalhallucinations and about 10% are thevisually impaired people get visualhallucinations you don't have to becompletely blind only sufficientlyimpairednow with the original description andthe 18th century Charles bonny did nothave them his grandfather had thesehallucinations his grandfather was amagistrate and elderly man he'd hadcataract surgery his vision was prettypoor and in 1759 he described to hisgrandson various things he was seeingthe first thing he said was he saw ahandkerchief in midair it was a largeblue handkerchief with four orangecircles and he knew it was ahallucination you don't havehandkerchiefs in midair and then he sawa big wheel in midair but sometimes hewasn't sure whether he was hallucinatingor not because the hallucinations wouldfit in the context of the visions so onone occasion when his granddaughter'swere visiting them he said and who werethese handsome young men with you andthey said alas Grampa par there are nohandsome young men and then the handsomeyoung men disappeared it's some typicalof these hallucinations that they maycome and a flash and disappear the fleshthey don't usually fade in and outthey're rather sudden and they changesuddenlyCharles Lulla the grandfather sawhundreds of different figures indifferent landscapes of all sorts on oneoccasion he saw a man and a bathrobesmoking a pipe and realized it washimself that was the only figure herecognized on one occasion when he waswalking the streets of Paris he saw thiswas realyeah folding but when he got back homehe saw a miniature of the scaffold andsix inches high on his study table thisrepetition of perception are sometimescalled Pavan op SIA well with him andwith Rosalie what seems to be going onand mostly said what's going on and Isaid that as you lose vision as thevisual parts of the brain are no longergetting any input they becomehyperactive and excitable and they startto fire spontaneously and you start tosee things the things you see can bevery complicated indeed with a anotherpatient of mine who also had some visionthe vision she had could be disturbingon one occasion she said she saw a manin a striped shirt and a restaurant andhe turned round and then he divided intosix figures and striped shirts whostarted walking towards herand then the six figures came togetherlike a concertina once when she wasdriving or rather her husband wasdriving the road divided into four andshe felt herself going simultaneously upfour roadsshe had very young mobile hallucinationsas well a lot of them had to do with acar sometimes she would see a teenageboy sitting on the hood of the car hewas very tenacious and he moved rathergracefully when when the car turned andthen when they came to a stop the boywould do a sudden vertical takeoff 100foot in the air and then disappearanother patient of mine had a differentsort of hallucination this was a womanwho didn't have trouble with her eyesbut the visual parts of her brain andthe tumor in the occipital cortex andabove all she would see cartoons andthese cartoons would be transparent andwould cover half of the visual fieldlike a screen and especially she sawcartoonsof Kermit the Frognow um I don't watch Sesame Street butshe made a point of saying why Kermitshe said Kermit the Frog means nothingto me you know I mean I was wonderingabout Freudian determinants why whyKermit Kermit the Frog means nothing tome she didn't mind the cartoons too muchbut what did disturb her was she gotvery persistent images or hallucinationsof faces and as with Rosa Lee the faceswere often deformed with very largeteeth or very large eyes and and thesefighting huh well what is going on withthese people as a physician I have totry and define what's going on and toreassure people especially to reassurethem that they're not going insanesomething like 10 percents as I said ofimpaired visually impaired people getthese but no more than 1% of the peopleacknowledge them because they're afraidthey will be seen as insane or somethingand if they do mention them to their owndoctors they may be misdiagnosed inparticular the notion is that if you seethings or hear things you're going madbut the psychotic hallucinations arequite differentpsychotic hallucinations whether they'revisual or vocal they address you theyaccuse you they seduce you theyhumiliate you they gear at you youinteract with them there is none of thisquality of being addressed with theseCharles bonnet hallucinations there is afilm you've gone until you're seeing afilm which had nothing to do with you orthat's our people think about it there'salso a rare thing called temporal lobeepilepsy and sometimes if one has thisone may feel oneself transported back toa time and place in the pastyou ought a particular road junctionsyou smell chestnuts roasting you hearthe traffic all the senses were involvedand you're waiting for your girl and asthat Tuesday evening back in 1982 andthe temporal lobe hallucinations are allsent SaLuSa nations full of feeling fullof familiarity located in space and timecoherent dramatic the shelves bony onesare quite different so in the theseshelves bony hallucinations you have allsorts of level from the geometricalhallucinations the pink and blue squaresthe woman had up to quite elaboratehallucinations with figures andespecially faces faces and sometimesdeformed faces of a single commonestthing in these hallucinations and one ofthe second common list is cartoons sowhat is going on fascinatingly in thelast few years has been possible to dofunctional brain imagedo fMRI on people as they arehallucinating and in fact to find thatdifferent parts of the visual brain areactivated as they are hallucinating whenpeople have these simple geometricalhallucinations the primary visual cortexis activated this is the part of thebrain which perceives ages and patternsyou don't form images with your primaryvisual cortex when images are formed ahigher part of the visual cortex isinvolved in the temporal lobe and inparticular one area the temporal lobe iscalled the fusiform gyrus and it's knownthat if people have damage in thefusiform gyrus they may lose the abilityto recognize faces but if there's anabnormal activity in the fusiform gyrusthey may hallucinate faces and this isexactly what you find in some of thesepeople there's an area in the anteriorpart of this gyrus where teeth and eyesare represented and that part of the jawis activated when people get thedeformed hallucinations there is anotherpart of the brain which is especiallyactivated when one sees cartoonsit's activated when one recognizescartoons when one duels cartoon so whenone hallucinates them it's it's veryinteresting that that should be specificthere are other parts of the brain whichare specifically involved with arecognition and hallucination ofbuildings and landscapes and around 1970it was found that there were not onlyparts of the brain but particular cellsface cells were discovered around 1970and now we know that there hundreds ofother sorts of cells which can be veryvery specific so you may not only havecar cells you may have them aasta.martincells i saw an aston martin this morningi had to bring it and and and now itsits in there somewhere so now at thislevel in what's called the info temporalcortex there are only visual images offigments of fragments it's only athigher levels that the other sensorsjoin in and their connections withmemory and emotion and in the Charlesbonnet syndromeyou don't go to those higher levelsyou're on these levels of inferiorvisual cortex where you have thousandsand tens of thousands and millions ofimages or figments of Hagman whofigments all newly encoded in particularcells or small clusters of cellsnormally these are all part of theintegrated stream of perception orimagination and one is not conscious ofthem it is only if one is visuallyimpaired or blind that the process isinterrupted and instead of gettingnormal perception you are getting ananarchic convulsive stimulation orrelease of all of these visual cells inthe info temporal cortex so suddenly yousee a face suddenly you see a carsuddenly this and suddenly that the minddoes its best to organize and to givesome sort of coherence to this but notterriblysuccessfully when these were firstdescribed it was thought that they couldbe interpreted like dreams but in factpeople say I don't recognize the peopleI can't form any associations permitmeans nothing to me you don't getanywhere thinking of them as dreams wellI'm more or less said what I wanted Ithink just um I just want torecapitulate and say this is commonthink of the number of blind people mustbe hundreds of thousands of live peoplewho had these hallucinations but are tooscared to mention them so this sort ofthing needs to be brought into intonotice for patients for doctors for thepublic finally I think they areinfinitely interesting and valuable forgiving one some insight as to how thebrain worksCharles Bonet said 250 years ago hewondered how the thinking of thesehallucinations how is he put at thetheater of the mind could be generatedby the machinery of the brain now 250years later I think we're beginning toglimpse how this is done thanks verymuch[Applause]speak about these things with so muchinsight and empathy your patience I meanhave you yourself experienced I mean thesyndromes you write about I was afraidyou would ask that well yeah a lot ofthem and actually I'm a little visuallyimpaired myself I'm blind and one I amnot terribly good in the other and I Isee the geometrical hallucinations butthey stop there and they don't disturbyou you because you understand what'sdoing it where they don't disturb meanymore than my tinnitus which which atwhich I ignore and they occasionallyinterest me and I have many pictures ofthem in my notebooks I've got an had anfMRI myself to see how my visual cortexis taking over and and when I see allthese hexagons and complex things whichI also have in visual migraine I Iwonder whether everyone sees things likethis and whether things like cave art orornamental art may have been derivedfrom them a bit that was an utterlyutterly fascinating talk thank you somuch for sharing prepared thank you",

two fundamental human needson the one hand our need for securityfor predictability for safetyfor dependability for reliabilityfor permanence all these anchoringgrounding experiences of our lives thatwe call homebut we also have an equally strong needmenand women for adventure for noveltyfor mystery for risk for dangerfor the unknown for the unexpectedsurpriseyou get the gist for journey for travelso reconciling our need for security andour need for adventure into onerelationship or what we today like tocall a passionate marriageused to be a contradiction in termsmarriage was an economicinstitution in which you were given apartnershipfor life in terms of children and socialstatusand succession and companionship but nowwe want our partner to still give us allthese thingsbut in addition i want you to be my bestfriend and my trusted confidant and mypassionate lover to boot and we livetwice as longso we come to one person and webasically areasking them to give us what once anentire village used to providegive me belonging give me identity giveme continuity but give me transcendenceand mystery andall all in one give me comfort give meedge give me novelty give me familiaritygive me predictability give me surpriseand we think it's a given and toys andlingerie are gonna save us with thatsoso now we get to the existential realityof this story rightbecause i think in some wayand i can i'll come back to that but thecrisis of desire is often a crisis ofthe imagination sowhy does good sex so often fade what isthe relationship between love and desirehow do they relate and how do theyconflictbecause therein lies the mystery oferoticismso if there is a verb for me that comeswith love it's to haveand if there is a verb that comes withdesire it is to wantin love we want to have we want to knowthe belovedwe want to minimize the distance we wantto contractthat gap we want to neutralize thetensionswe want closeness but in desirewe tend to not really want to go back tothe places we've already goneforegone conclusion does not keep ourinterestin desire we want an other somebody onthe other side that we can go visitthat we can go spend some time with thatwe can go see what goes on in their redlight districtyou know in desire we want a bridge tocrossor in other words i sometimes say fireneeds airdesire needs a space and when it's saidlike that it's often quiteabstract but then i took a question withme and i've gone to more than 20countries in the last few years withmating in captivityand i ask people when do you findyourself most drawn to your partnernot attracted sexually per se but mostdrawnand across culture across religion andacross gender except for onethere are a few answers that just keepcoming backso the first group is i am most drawn tomy partnerwhen she's away when we are apartwhen we reunite basicallywhen i get back in touch with my abilityto imagine myself with my partner whenmy imagination comes back in the pictureand when i can root it in absence and inlongingwhich is a major component of desire butthen the second groupis even more interesting i am most drawnto my partnerwhen i see him in the studio when she'son stagewhen he's in his element when she'sdoing something she's passionate aboutwhen i see him at the party and otherpeople are really drawn to himwhen i see her hold court basically wheni look at my partnerradiant and confident probably thebiggest turn on across the boardradiant as in self-sustaining i look atthis personby the way in desire people rarely talkabout it when we are blended into onefive centimeters from each other i don'tknow any interest how much that isbut it's also not when the other personis that far apart that you no longer seethemit's when i'm looking at my partner froma comfortable distancewhere this person that is already sofamiliarso known is momentarily once againsomewhat mysterioussomewhat elusive and in this spacebetween me and the otherlies the erotic ellen lies that movementtoward the otherbecause sometimes as bruce says mysteryis not about traveling to new places butit's about looking with new eyesand so when i see my partner on his ownor her owndoing something in which they areenveloped i look at this personand i momentarily get a shift inperception and i stayopen to the mysteries that are livingright next to meand then more importantly in thisdescriptionabout the other or myself it's the samewhat is most interesting is that thereis no neediness in desirenobody needs anybody there is nocaretaking in desire caretaking ismightily loving it's a powerfulanti-aphrodisiaci have yet to see somebody who is soturned on by somebody who needs themwanting them is one thing needing themis a shutdown and women have known thatforever becauseanything that will bring up parenthoodwill usually decrease the erotic chargefor good reasons right and then thethird group of answers usually would bewhen i'm surprised when we laughtogetherum as somebody said to me in the officetoday when he's in his talk so i saidyou know it's either the talks or thecowboy bootsyou know it is a but basically it's whenyou when there is noveltybut novelty isn't about new positions itisn't a repertoire of techniquesnovelty is what parts of you do youbring outwhat parts of you are just being seenbecausein some way one could say sex isn'tsomething you do huhsex is a place you go it's a space youenterinside yourself and with another orothersso where do you go in sex what parts ofyou do you connectto what do you seek to express there isit a placefor transcendence and spiritual union isit a place fornaughtiness and is it a place to besafely aggressive is it a place whereyou can finally surrender and nothave to take responsibility foreverything is it a place where you canexpress yourinfantile wishes what comes out thereit's a languageit isn't just a behavior and it's apoetic of that language that i'minterested in which is why i began toexplore this concept of eroticintelligenceyou know animals have sex it's the pivotit's biology it's the natural instinctwe are the only ones who have an eroticlifewhich means that it's sexualitytransformed by the human imagination weare the only ones who can make lovefor hours have a blissful time multipleorgasms and touch nobody just because wecan imagine itwe can hint at it we don't even have todo it we can experience thatpowerful thing called anticipation whichis a mortar to desirethe ability to imagine it as if it'shappeningto experience it as if it's happeningwhile nothing is happeningand everything is happening at the sametime sowhen i began to think about eroticism ibegan to think about the poetics of sexand and if i look at it as anintelligence then it's something thatyou cultivatewhat are the ingredients imaginationplayfulness novelty curiositymystery but the central agent is reallythatthat piece called the imagination butmore importantlyfor me to begin to understand who arethe couples who have an erotic sparkwhat sustains desire i had to go back tothe original definition oferoticism the mystical definition and iwent through it through a bifurcation bylooking actually a traumawhich is the other side and i looked atit at looking at the community that ihad grown up in which was a community inbelgiumall holocaust survivors and in mycommunity there were two groupsthose who didn't die and those who cameback to lifeand those who didn't die lived oftenvery tethered to the groundcould not experience pleasure could nottrustbecause when you're vigilant worriedanxious and insecureyou can't lift your head to go and takeoff in space and be playful and safeand imaginative those who came back tolife were those who understood theerotic as an antidote to deaththey knew how to keep themselves aliveand when i began to listen to thesexlessness of the couples that i workwithi sometimes would hear people say i wantmore sexbut generally people want better sex andbetter is to reconnect with that qualityof aliveness of vibrancy of renewal ofvitalityof eros of energy that sex used toafford them or that they've hoped itwould affordthem and so i began to ask a differentquestioni shut myself off when began to be thequestioni turn off my desires when which is notthe same question as what turns me offisand you turn me off when and peoplebegan to say iturn myself off when i feel dead insidewhen i don't like my bodywhen i feel old when i haven't had timefor myself when i haven't had a chanceto even check in with youwhen i don't perform when i work when ifeel low self-esteem when i don't have asense of self-worthwhen i don't feel like i have a right towant to taketo receive pleasure and then i began toask the reverse question i turn myselfon when because most of the time peoplelike to ask the questionyou turn me on what turns me on and i'mout of the questionyou know now if you are dead inside theother person can do a lot of things forvalentine it won't make a dent there isnobody at the reception deskyou know so i turn myself on when i turnmy desires iwake up when you know nowin this paradox between love and desirewhat seems to be sopuzzling is that the very ingredientsthat nurturelove mutuality reciprocity protectionworry responsibility for the other aresometimes the very ingredients thatstifle desirebecause desire comes with a host offeelings that are not always soum favorites of love jealousypossessivenessaggression power dominance naughtinessmischief basically most of us you knowwill get turned on at night by the verysame things that we will demonstrateagainst during the dayyou know the erotic mind is not verypolitically correctif everybody was fantasizing on a bed ofroses we wouldn't be having suchinteresting talks about thisyou know but no in our mind up thereare a host of things going on that wedon't always know how to bring to theperson that we love becausewe think love comes with selflessnessand in fact desire comes with a certainamount of selfishness in the best senseof the wordthe ability to stay connected to oneselfin the presence of anotherso i want to draw that little image foryou becausethis need to reconcile these two sets ofneedswe are born with that our need forconnection our need for separateness orour need for security and adventureor a need for togetherness and forautonomy and if you think about thelittle kid who sits on your lapand who is cozily nested here and verysecure and comfortable and at somepoint all of us need to go out into theworldto discover and to explore that's thebeginning of desirethat next exploratory needs curiositydiscovery and then at some point theyturn around and they look at youand if you tell them hey kiddo theworld's a great place go for it there'sso much fun out therethen they can turn away and they canexperience connection and separatenessat the same time they can go off intheir imaginationoff in their body off in theirplayfulnessall the while knowing that there'ssomebody when they come back tobut if on this side there is somebodywho says i'm worriedi'm anxious i'm depressed my partnerhasn't taken care of me in so longwhat's so good out there don't we haveeverything you needtogether you and i then there are a fewlittle reactions thatall of us can pretty much recognizesome of us will come back came back along time agoand that little child who comes back isthe child who will forego a part ofhimselfin order not to lose the other i willlose my freedomin order not to lose connection and iwill learn to love in a certain waythat will become burdened with extraworry andextra responsibility and extraprotectionand i won't know how to leave you inorderto go play in order to go experiencepleasurein order to discover to enter insidemyselftranslate this into adult language itstarts very youngit continues into our sex lives up tothe endchild number two comes back but lookslike that over their shoulder all thetimeyou know are you gonna be there you'regonna curse me you're gonna scold meyou're gonna be angry with meand they may be gone but they're neverreally away and those are often thepeople that will tell you in thebeginning it was super hotbecause in the beginning the growingintimacy wasn't yetso strong that it actually led to thedecrease of desirethe more connected i became the moreresponsible i feltthe less i was able to let go in yourpresencethe third child doesn't really come backso what happens if you want to sustaindesireit's that real dialectic piece on theone hand you want the security in orderto be able to goon the other hand if you can't go youcan't have pleasureyou can't culminate you don't have anorgasm you don't get excited because youspend yourtime in the body and the head of theother and not in your ownso in this dilemma about reconcilingthese two sets of fundamental needsthere are a few things that i've come tounderstand erotic couples doone they have a lot of sexual privacythey understand that there is an eroticspace that belongs to each of themthey also understand that foreplay isnot something you do five minutes beforethe real thingforeplay pretty much starts at the endof the previous orgasmthey also understand that an eroticspaceisn't about you begin to stroke theother it's about to create a space whereyou leave management incmaybe where you leave the agile programand you actuallyjust are enter that place where you stopbeing the good citizen who is takingcare of things and being responsibleresponsibility and desire just badheads they don't really do well togethererotic couples also understand thatpassion waxes and wanesit's pretty much like the moon it hasintermittent eclipsesbut what they know is they know how toresurrect it they know how to bring itbackand they know how to bring it backbecause they have demystified one bigmythwhich is the myth of spontaneity whichis that it's just going to fall fromheaven while you're folding the laundrylike a deus ex maculaand in fact they understood thatwhatever going is going to just happenin a long-term relationshipalready has committed sex ispremeditated sexit's willful it's intentionalit's focus and presence mary valentine",

   "title": "The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology | Pranav Mistry",
   "publishedAt": "18 Nov 2009",
   "transcription": "We grew upinteracting with the physicalobjects around us.There are an enormous number of themthat we use every day.Unlike most of our computing devices,these objects are much more fun to use.When you talk about objects,one other thing automaticallycomes attached to that thing,and that is gestures:how we manipulate these objects,how we use these objects in everyday life.We use gestures not only to interactwith these objects,but we also use themto interact with each other.A gesture of \"Namaste!\",maybe, to respect someone, or maybe,in India I don't need to teacha kid that this means\"four runs\" in cricket.It comes as a partof our everyday learning.So, I am very interested,from the beginning,how our knowledgeabout everyday objects and gestures,and how we use these objects,can be leveraged to our interactionswith the digital world.Rather than using a keyboard and mouse,why can I not use my computerin the same way that I interactin the physical world?So, I started this explorationaround eight years back,and it literally startedwith a mouse on my desk.Rather than using it for my computer,I actually opened it.Most of you might be awarethat, in those days,the mouse used to come with a ball inside,and there were two rollersthat actually guide the computerwhere the ball is moving,and, accordingly,where the mouse is moving.So, I was interested in these two rollers,and I actually wanted more, so I borrowedanother mouse from a friend --never returned to him --and I now had four rollers.Interestingly, what I didwith these rollers is,basically, I took them off of these mousesand then put them in one line.It had some stringsand pulleys and some springs.What I got is basicallya gesture-interface devicethat actually actsas a motion-sensing devicemade for two dollars.So, here, whatever movementI do in my physical worldis actually replicatedinside the digital worldjust using this small devicethat I made, around eight years back,in 2000.Because I was interestedin integrating these two worlds,I thought of sticky notes.I thought, \"Why can I not connectthe normal interfaceof a physical sticky noteto the digital world?\"A message writtenon a sticky note to my mom,on paper,can come to an SMS,or maybe a meeting reminderautomatically syncswith my digital calendar --a to-do list that automaticallysyncs with you.But you can also searchin the digital world,or maybe you can write a query, saying,\"What is Dr. Smith's address?\"and this small systemactually prints it out --so it actually acts like a paperinput-output system,just made out of paper.In another exploration,I thought of making a penthat can draw in three dimensions.So, I implemented this penthat can help designers and architectsnot only think in three dimensions,but they can actually draw,so that it's more intuitiveto use that way.Then I thought,\"Why not make a Google Map,but in the physical world?\"Rather than typing a keywordto find something,I put my objects on top of it.If I put a boarding pass, it will show mewhere the flight gate is.A coffee cup will showwhere you can find more coffee,or where you can trash the cup.So, these were someof the earlier explorations I didbecause the goal was to connectthese two worlds seamlessly.Among all these experiments,there was one thing in common:I was trying to bringa part of the physical worldto the digital world.I was taking some part of the objects,or any of the intuitiveness of real life,and bringing them to the digital world,because the goal was to makeour computing interfaces more intuitive.But then I realized that we humansare not actually interested in computing.What we are interested in is information.We want to know about things.We want to know aboutdynamic things going around.So I thought, around last year --in the beginning of the last year --I started thinking, \"Why can I not takethis approach in the reverse way?\"Maybe, \"How about I take my digital worldand paint the physical worldwith that digital information?\"Because pixels are actually, right now,confined in these rectangular devicesthat fit in our pockets.Why can I not remove this confineand take that to my everydayobjects, everyday lifeso that I don't needto learn the new languagefor interacting with those pixels?So, in order to realize this dream,I actually thought of puttinga big-size projector on my head.I think that's why this is calleda head-mounted projector, isn't it?I took it very literally,and took my bike helmet,put a little cut over there so thatthe projector actually fits nicely.So now, what I can do --I can augment the world around mewith this digital information.But later,I realized that I actuallywanted to interactwith those digital pixels, also.So I put a small camera over therethat acts as a digital eye.Later, we moved to a much better,consumer-oriented pendant version of that,that many of you now knowas the SixthSense device.But the most interesting thingabout this particular technologyis that you can carryyour digital world with youwherever you go.You can start using any surface,any wall around you,as an interface.The camera is actually trackingall your gestures.Whatever you're doing with your hands,it's understanding that gesture.And, actually, if you see,there are some color markersthat in the beginning versionwe are using with it.You can start painting on any wall.You stop by a wall,and start painting on that wall.But we are not only trackingone finger, here.We are giving you the freedomof using all of both of your hands,so you can actually use both of your handsto zoom into or zoom outof a map just by pinching all present.The camera is actually doing --just, getting all the images --is doing the edge recognitionand also the color recognitionand so many other small algorithmsare going on inside.So, technically,it's a little bit complex,but it gives you an output which is moreintuitive to use, in some sense.But I'm more excited that you canactually take it outside.Rather than getting your cameraout of your pocket,you can just do the gestureof taking a photo,and it takes a photo for you.(Applause)Thank you.And later I can find a wall, anywhere,and start browsing those photosor maybe, \"OK, I want to modifythis photo a little bitand send it as an email to a friend.\"So, we are looking for an erawhere computing will actually mergewith the physical world.And, of course,if you don't have any surface,you can start using your palmfor simple operations.Here, I'm dialing a phone numberjust using my hand.The camera is actually notonly understanding your hand movements,but, interestingly,is also able to understand what objectsyou are holding in your hand.For example, in this case,the book cover is matchedwith so many thousands,or maybe millions of books online,and checking out which book it is.Once it has that information,it finds out more reviews about that,or maybe New York Timeshas a sound overview on that,so you can actually hear,on a physical book,a review as sound.(Video) Famous talkat Harvard University --This was Obama's visit last week to MIT.(Video) And particularly I wantto thank two outstanding MIT --Pranav Mistry: So, I was seeingthe live [video] of his talk,outside, on just a newspaper.Your newspaper will show youlive weather informationrather than having it updated.You have to check your computerin order to do that, right?(Applause)When I'm going back,I can just use my boarding passto check how much my flighthas been delayed,because at that particular time,I'm not feeling like opening my iPhone,and checking out a particular icon.And I think this technologywill not only change the way --(Laughter)Yes.It will change the waywe interact with people, also,not only the physical world.The fun part is, I'm goingto the Boston metro,and playing a pong game inside the trainon the ground, right?(Laughter)And I think the imaginationis the only limitof what you can think ofwhen this kind of technologymerges with real life.But many of you argue, actually,that all of our work is notonly about physical objects.We actually do lotsof accounting and paper editingand all those kinds of things;what about that?And many of you are excitedabout the next-generation tablet computersto come out in the market.So, rather than waiting for that,I actually made my own,just using a piece of paper.So, what I did hereis remove the camera --All the webcam cameras havea microphone inside the camera.I removed the microphone from that,and then just pinched that --like I just made a clipout of the microphone --and clipped that to a piece of paper,any paper that you found around.So now the sound of the touchis getting me when exactlyI'm touching the paper.But the camera is actually trackingwhere my fingers are moving.You can of course watch movies.(Video) Good afternoon.My name is Russell,and I am a WildernessExplorer in Tribe 54.\"PM: And you can of course play games.(Car engine)Here, the camera is actually understandinghow you're holding the paperand playing a car-racing game.(Applause)Many of you already must havethought, OK, you can browse.Yeah. Of course you canbrowse to any websitesor you can do all sortsof computing on a piece of paperwherever you need it.So, more interestingly,I'm interested in how we cantake that in a more dynamic way.When I come back to my desk,I can just pinch that informationback to my desktopso I can use my full-size computer.(Applause)And why only computers?We can just play with papers.Paper world is interesting to play with.Here, I'm taking a part of a document,and putting over here a second partfrom a second place,and I'm actually modifying the informationthat I have over there.Yeah. And I say, \"OK, this looks nice,let me print it out, that thing.\"So I now have a print-out of that thing.So the workflow is more intuitive,the way we used to do itmaybe 20 years back,rather than now switchingbetween these two worlds.So, as a last thought,I think that integratinginformation to everyday objectswill not only help us to get ridof the digital divide,the gap between these two worlds,but will also help us, in some way,to stay human,to be more connectedto our physical world.And it will actually help usnot end up being machinessitting in front of other machines.That's all. Thank you.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)Chris Anderson: So, Pranav,first of all, you're a genius.This is incredible, really.What are you doing with this?Is there a company being planned?Or is this research forever, or what?Pranav Mistry: So, there arelots of companies,sponsor companies of Media Labinterested in taking this aheadin one or another way.Companies like mobile-phone operatorswant to take this in a different waythan the NGOs in India,thinking, \"Why can we onlyhave 'Sixth Sense'?We should have a 'Fifth Sense'for missing-sense people who cannot speak.This technology can be used for themto speak out in a different waymaybe a speaker system.\"CA: What are your own plans?Are you staying at MIT,or are you going to dosomething with this?PM: I'm trying to make thismore available to peopleso that anyone can developtheir own SixthSense device,because the hardware is actuallynot that hard to manufactureor hard to make your own.We will provide all the open sourcesoftware for them,maybe starting next month.CA: Open source? Wow.(Applause)CA: Are you going to come back to Indiawith some of this, at some point?PM: Yeah. Yes, yes, of course.CA: What are your plans? MIT? India?How are you going to splityour time going forward?PM: There is a lot of energy here.Lots of learning.All of this work that you have seenis all about my learning in India.And now, if you see, it's more aboutthe cost-effectiveness:this system costs you $300compared to the $20,000 surface tables,or anything like that.Or maybe even the $2 mouse gesture systemat that time was costing around $5,000?I showed that, at a conference,to President Abdul Kalam, at that time,and then he said, \"OK, we should use thisin Bhabha Atomic Research Centrefor some use of that.\"So I'm excited about how I can bringthe technology to the massesrather than just keeping that technologyin the lab environment.(Applause)CA: Based on the people we've seen at TED,I would say you're trulyone of the two or threebest inventors in the world right now.It's an honor to have you at TED.Thank you so much.That's fantastic.(Applause)",

of theworld's greatest minds offer tools forus to navigate through and thrive inthese really uncertain times I'm WhitneyPennington Rogers Ted's current affairscurator and I'll be one of your hostsfor today's event yesterday we kickedoff this series with an interview fromacclaimed psychologist Susan David whooffered us some tips on how to really beour best selves in these trying timesand we're gonna switch gears a littlebit today from thinking about our ownpersonal mental health to the state ofour global public health systems thankyou I guess we have a pretty excitingguest to introduce on the other side ofthe countrylet's bring in Bill Gates bill they saythe the best known people are the lessyou have to insure them so it's great tohave you here how are you doing well Ithink this is a unprecedented reallydisconcerting time for everyone withthings being shut down not knowingexactly how long it's going to lastworrying about the health of all thepeople we care about mm-hmm you know I'mlucky that I get to connect up withvideo conferencing using teams a lot sothat you know foundation is stepping upand there's a lot of great people tryingto help with this crisis but it it'sscary for everyone you basically stuckat home like like many of us watchingyeah almost all my meetings are usingteams now I'm getting used to that youknow I've gone days without seems seenany work coworkerslet's talk here bill five years ago youstood on the Ted stage and you gave thisthis chilling warning thatthe world was in danger at some point ofa major pandemic people watching thattalk now you know the hair stands up inthe back of their neck it is it isexactly what we're living through whathappened it did people listened to thatwarning at all basically no you know Iwas hopeful that with the Zika and abola and SARS and MERS they all remindedus that particularly in a world wherepeople move around so much you can gethuge devastation and so the talk was tosay hey we're not ready for the nextpandemic but in fact there's advances inscience that if we put resources againstthem we can be ready sadly very littlewas done there were some things theCoalition for epidemic preparednessinnovation CEP I was funded by ourfoundation Wellcome Trust and a numberof governments to do some of theplatform vaccine work but the in thearea of Diagnostics antibodiesantivirals basically doing the diseasegames that I talked about where we'dsimulate what needed to be done wehardly did anything and and so now herewe have a respiratory virus that issadly fulfilling some of the morenegative predictions I made I mean lastmonth you said that this might be thebig one you you you you wrote that thisthis could be the sort ofonce-in-a-centurypandemic that people had been fearing isthat how you think of it still well Iit's awful to say this but we could havea respiratory virus whose case fatalityrate was even higher if this wassomething like smallpox you know thatkills 30 percent of people so this ishorrific but you know in fact mostpeople even who get the Coa disease are able to survive so in inthat it's quite infectious way moreinfectious than MERS or SARS were it'snot as fatal as they were and yet thedisruption were seen in order to knockit down is is you know really completelyunprecedented so this is a you know it'sgoing global that was it's respiratorythat was the great fear how many peopleend up dying hopefully you know if we dothe right things it won't be a giganticnumber so it's you know we should end upnot having the 1918 flu situation weshould be able to do a lot better thanthat and that's that's because ofactions that we would take I mean leftwithout the right actions the prospectsare pretty are pretty deadly I mean ifwe if we knew what we knew in 1919 thisthing could take out many tens ofmillions of people around the worldbecause like you said is the key thinghere that is it's got this sort ofstrange combination of being certainlymore dangerous than flu not as dangerousas something like Ebola or SARS but moreinteresting than flu by a factor but butbut infectious and and also infectiousbefore symptoms have started is thatpart of why it's it's been really hardto respond to youright so Ebola you're actually flat onyour back before your very infectious soyou're not at church or in a bus or at astore with most respiratory viruses likethe flu and kovat at first you only feela little bit of a fever and a little bitsick and so there's the possibilityyou're going about your normalactivities and infecting other peopleand so right you know human and humantransmissible respiratory viruses thatin the earlystage aren't stopping you from doingthings that's kind of a worst case andthat's where you know I did a flusimulation in the 2015 talk and showedhow quickly it spread you know versus1918 people move around a lot more nowthan they used to and so that worksagainst us now the medical system thatsteps up to treat people is also far farbetter but it was when was it clear toyou that that unless we acted this thiscould be a really deadly pandemic wellin January it was discussed that therewas human human transmission takingplace and so you know the alarm bellswere ringing that this fits the veryscary pattern that it will be verydifficult to contain and in in onJanuary 23rd China did their equivalentof the shutdown did it in a fairlyextreme form the very good news is thatthey were able to reduce the infectionrates dramatically because of thoseactions but it's it's January whereeverybody should have been on noticelet's get our act together with testinglet's get going on therapeutics andvaccines we've got to get organizedbecause we have this novel respiratoryvirus whose infectiousness and fatalityput it in that super scary range and sowhat what did happens is such a mysteryto me about the sort of the last monthof preparation certainly I mean in manycountries and certainly in the u.s.we're where we are were you on the phoneto people during early February lateJanuary early February saying you knowguys you know what's going on this is areally big deal what are we doing whatwhat was happening behind the scenesduringperiod well you'd like to havegovernment money show up for the keyactivities we put out a hundred millionwe created the therapeutics acceleratorthere's the period between when werealized it was transmitting and nowwhere we should have done more I thinkthe most important thing to discusstoday is that in the area of testingwe're still not creating that capacityand applying it to the people most inneed and so we have health workers whoare symptomatic who can't get a test andso they don't know should they go in andnot go in and yet we have lots of testsbeing given to people aren't symptomaticand so the testing thing to me it it'sgot to be organized it's got to beprioritized that is super super Junt thesecond thing is the isolation that youknow various parts just focusing on theu.s. some parts are doing that in afairly strong way and other parts notyet and you know it's very hard to doit's tough on people it's disastrous forthe economy but they sooner you do it ina in a tough way the sooner you can undoit and go back to normal I sense it willcome to the isolation pot in in a minutebut it's just sticking with the testingthing I'm just so confused as to whywith more than a month's notice I meanthere are so many smart epidemiologistsin the in the US for example you plugnumbers about infectious nurse andfatality into any simulation and you seethat if you don't do anything millionsof people will die and there's a monthso what what's your explanation for whatwhat do you think happened here as towhy just know there was almost no test amonth later there was no viable test inthe US was this just governmentcomplexity too many chefs in the kitchenwhat on earth happened herewell we certainly didn't take advantageof the month of February the good newsis that the actual process the PCRmachines we have a lot in the UnitedStates and so there's models like SouthKorea who took advantage of Februarybuilt up the testing capacity and theywere able to contact race and theirinfections have gone down even withoutthe type of shutdown that because we'relate we're having to do one thing thatis good news just this week is thatpeople are thought to do this test thatyou have to have a nurse or doctor shovea swab way up all the way to the back ofyour throat which hurts a lot but alsoyou're gonna cough and potentiallyspread the disease to that healthcareworker so they have to have protectiveequipment and change that what we sentdata to the FDA this weekend showingthat just a individual by themselvesswabbing up to the tip of their nosethey are able the accuracy of that testis essentially the same as having ahealthcare worker do it that helps a lotit we still have to do other things butthat means that you don't have to changeprotective equipment you just hand thepatient that swab they do it put it inthe test tube and if the capacitiesright within 24 hours you should getthat result back so how do you see thatplaying out that other people kind ofmassively scale there's those tests andand how will how will ordinary citizensbe able to get hold of them it does itstill have to be actually kind ofprescribed by a doctor at some point orat some point will you be able to justorder them off Amazon or something andwell pretty chaotic today because thegovernment hasn't stepped in to makesure that the testing capacity is bothincreased and it's used for the rightcases there will be a website and if thefederaldoesn't do it a lot of local governmentswill have to do it that you go to yougive your situation including yoursymptoms you're told you know based onyour work and your symptoms are you apriority if so you're told where thereare kiosks you can go to and you'll dothe self swab and just hand it over oreventually we'll send the kits to you athome and then you'll send it back andand hear that result maybe six monthsfrom now you'll actually be able to havea strip where you perform the tests inthe home but for now they sending itback for the PCR processing we can havemassive capacity there and that's howyou know the testing is everythingbecause that's how you know whether youneed to do more shutdown or you'restarting to get to the point where youcan relieve it some people are trying toargue now that almost the testing shouldbe dogged back because you know the catis out of the bag testing is bringingpeople together and risking infectionyou know forget that let's just focus ontreatment and on isolate and onisolation strategies you disagree withthat testing is still absolutelyessential and it needs to be swelling itdid go together our testing at very highvolume and the isolation piece if you'rea if you're a medical worker you want tostay and do your job if you're makingsure the electricity water or food isstill available you want to do your joband so testing is what indicates to youdo you need to go into isolation andmake sure you're not the source ofspread and so you know testing is is thekey thing you know South Korea did thatin this massive way that you knoweverybody should learn from and so thatit that is paired with the isolationpiece our goal here is to get to thepoint where a very small percentage ofthe population is infected you knowChina only 0.01 percent of thepopulation was inaffected if you let it if you don't dothese things you're gonna get to themajority people infected and that hugeoverload of the medical system Whitneyhas some questions from our onlineaudienceWhitney some of the questions that we'reseeing are about how our tech giant'sand leaders can play a role in inisolating this and containing this onthis virus you know the tech companiesare very involved in making sure thatsome work can go onyou know people can stay in touch youknow they can help with some of thedisease modeling they can help with thedisability of the numbers it's actuallyvery impressive you know you get upthere and you can see you know thosenumbers actually they're sad numbers butyou know everybody is able to monitorthis thing back in 1918 they didn't havethis type of visibility and an abilityto share best practices but for a lot ofpeople the isolation is the key thing Imean bill one of the the riddles aboutthis isolation strategy is how long ithow long has to last right like a lot ofpeople are concerned that the the priceof victory by isolating everyone is thatyou crash the economy and that you knowwhat we have to be basically at home notdoing our regular jobs for three sixmonths maybe it may be all year and somuch so that there's now this big debatein the US and other countries about thismay just be the wrong strategy that wecan't crash the economy that badly weshould only isolate for another coupleweeks and then let people back and ifthat means you know a lot of otherpeople get sick and we eventually buildup herd humidity that may be the rightthe right way to go what's your thoughton this what is the isolation strategythat eventually leads to us getting backto normal and it's very tough to say topeople hey keep going to restaurants youknow go buy new houses ignore that pileof bodies over in the corner just youknow we want you to keep spendingbecause there's somemaybe a politician who thinks GDP growthis is what really counts it's very hardto tell people when there's an epidemicspreading that you know threatensparticularly their parents or elderlypeople that they know that they shouldgo about things knowing that theiractivity is spreading this disease Idon't know of any rich countries thathave chosen to use that approach it istrue if you did that approach over aperiod of several years and not peoplewould be infected you'd have what'scalled herd immunity they heardimmunities meaningless until you in factover half the population and so you cantake you'll overload your medical systemso your case fatality rate instead ofbeing 1% will be like 3 4 percent and soyou know the idea it's veryirresponsible for somebody to suggest wecan have the best of both worlds what weneed is the extreme shutdown to so thatin six to ten weeks if things go wellthen you can start opening back up sojust putting the math together from whatyou just said bill to get to herdimmunity you needed more than half thepeople in the country to basically getthe bug so in the case of the US forexample that'd be 150 million peoplethere abouts you said that there couldbe that the fatality rate in thatscenario you're talking about four tofive million people and that in thatpotential fatalities I mean it's likelike it thought that's just a horrifyingscenario that no one should becontemplating even one percent of theirpopulation getting sick they will treatwhoever goes for this ignore the diseasestrategy they will treat them as apariah state so no none of their peoplewill go in and none of your people willgo into that and so briefly a fewcountries in Europe that haven't reallylooked at this hard considered okayshould be we be the ones who kind of goabout business as usual it is temptingbecause if if you got there early SouthKorea did not have to do the extremeshutdown because they did such a goodjob on testing and you knowthat's why testing and containment meanto me that the government's notallocating the testing to to where it'sneeded you know and maybe that'll haveto happen at the state level becauseit's it's not having at the federallevel but there is there is no middlecourse on this thing it is sad that theshutdown will be harder for poorcountries than it is for richercountriesso let's come into that in a minute butjust it's the one exception I've had thecase-mate for is Japan that Japan hasnot contained it and quite in the sameway that South Korea did but has allowedpeople to work it's try to make extrememeasures for protecting the most elderlypopulation but they've they've tried tosort of let they try to find a middle ofscenario haven't they well if you actwhen you have you know hundreds of casesyou may be able to contain it by doinggreat testing and great contact tracingand restricting foreigners coming inwithout as much damage to our economythe US has passed this opportunity tocontrol without shutdown so that theworst case of what was happening inWuhan in the beginning or in northernItaly you know the last few weeks thatwe avoid that but we we did not havefast enough to have a an ability toavoid the shutdown but then what I don'tunderstand in the case of the US forexample is that if if even if we'resuccessful in bending the curve andreducing the number of new cases from aperiod of extreme shutdown as it were noimmunity has been built up let's saythat there's still no vaccine surelywhen you lift restrictions and peoplestart going back to what the whole thingjust blows up againthe experience that we're seeing inChina and in South Korea is that thereare not these people are asymptomaticthat are causing lots of infections andthat's a parameter that if you build themodel you have to put in if there's animperial model that people talk about alot which shows that reopening is veryhard to do but it the results of thatmodel are not matching what we see inChina and so very likely there aren't asmany of these infecting asymptomatic s'and that's what you have to be pragmaticthere's a lot we don't know for exampleseasonality may help us in the northernhemisphere the force of infection willrespiratory viruses to some degree theyall are our seasonal we don't know howseasonal this one is but you knowthere's a reasonable chance that theforce of infection will be going downand it's you're testing that always istelling you oh my gosh do I have to shutdown more or can I start to open up soparticularly right as you open up thattesting and contact tracing is is sayingto you and I'm you know you can say I'mon the more optimistic side that it willbe possible to do what China's doingwhere you know they are starting to goback to normal and help me understandwhat happened that it's it seems kind ofmiraculous to me because they this viruswas exploding yes in Wuhan but butpeople moved from there to many otherparts of China how is it possible thatthat the combination of the shut down inWuhan and measures elsewhere seem tohave got to the point where there areliterally no new cases happening I meanto me that implies that literally thevirus is not circulating at all betweenhumans in China how on you know there'sa few tourists coming in who they dealwith but I mean how on earth like isthat is that literally yourinterpretation of what happened thatit's no longer second is take aspreadsheet and take a number like forone person affects four people and saythe cycle you knows every tendays go through you know eight of thosecycles and you're getting a big numberyou know start with ten thousand andthen you know that increase if you takethe number point four instead that isthe average case in facts point fourpeople which then look at what happensto that number as you go out it drops tozero and so things that are exponentialare very very dramatic when they'reabove one they are growing rapidly whenthey're below one they're shrinkingrapidly and so the isolation in Chinadrove that reproductive number to wellbelow zero and to locally below onebelow one sorry and it's a you knowthat's that quarantine that's you knowquarantine comes from forty days whichis what they thought would help forblack black plague that is our primarytechnique thank God we have testing ifwe use it properly we are you know doingtherapeutics which will help with thedeath rate but in terms of the keepinginfections will one percent of thepopulation it's it's really all dependsjust on the two things isolation andtesting so it's a question for mytwitter feed this morning for you billbut if you were president for a month inthe US what would be the the top two orthree things you would do well the clearmessage that we have no choice tomaintain this isolation and that's goingto keep going for a period of time youknow probably in the Chinese case it waslike six weeks so we have to prepareourselves for that and do it very welland then use the testing and every weektalk about what's going on with that ifyou're doing isolation well within abouttwenty days you'll see those numbersreally change you know instead of thisyou'll see this andis a sign that you're on your way it nowyou have to stay to get those moregenerations that are you know point fourinfections per previous infection youhave to maintain it for a number ofweeks there and you know so this is notgonna be easy we need a clear messageabout that it is really tragic that theeconomic effects of this are verydramatic I mean nothing like this hasever happened to the economy in our ourlifetimes but money you know bringingthe economy back on doing money that'smore of a reversible thing than bringingpeople back to life and so we're goingto take the pain in the economicdimension huge pain in order to minimizethe pain in the disease and deathdimension Whitney we have a lot of otherquestions coming in one of the ones thatwe've been seeing is this a questionabout what tools are available forcountries that maybe don't have theluxury of being able to social distancedon't have great health systems in placehow should they be handling this virusyeah I would say that if the richcountries really do their job well bythe summer they'll be like China is aresome of the other countries thatresponded early but in the developingcountries particularly in the southernhemisphere this seasonality is is largethe as you say the ability to isolateyou know when you go out to get yourfood every day you know you have to earnyour wage when you live in a Aslam whereyou're very near by each other it's veryhard to do as you move down the incomeladder then it is for a country likelike the United States and so we shouldall you know accelerate the vaccinewhich eventually will come and you knowpeople are being responsible to say thatyou know that's going to take 18 monthsand there's a lot of those being pursuedyou know I'm talkingwith South Berkeley who you're gonnahave later this week who can talk a lotabout the vaccine front because he'sdefinitely at the center of that atbeing the head of of Gavi we do need toget really cheap testing out to thesecountries and we need to gettherapeutics so you don't need to put 5%of people on respirators because even ifthey had the equipment they don't havethe personnel they just don't have thebeds the capacity and so the only goodnews is that the rich countries havethis and so they will be learning abouttesting therapeutics and funding thevaccines for the entire world to try andminimize the the damage in developingcountries great I'll be back later withmore questions yeah bill you mentionedtherapeutics there what is lookingpromising is anything looking promisingyeah so there's quite a range of thingsgoing on there's a few that getmentioned blot REM sabadie rhydrochloric Anisa through myosin andthe date is still a bit confusing butthere's some positive data on those rm7here is a five-day IV infusion andactually kind of hard to manufacturer sopeople are looking at how that can beimproved the hydrochloric in looks likeit works somewhat if you get an earlythere are a huge list of compoundsincluding antibodies antiviral drugs andso the Gates Foundation and WellcomeTrust would support from MasterCard nowothers created this therapeuticsaccelerator to really triage out youhave hundreds of people showing up andsaying trying this try that so we lookat lab assays animal models and so weunderstand which things should beprioritized for these very quick humantrials that need to be done all over theworld and so the coordination on that isvery complex globally but I think youknow out of the top 20 orso candidates probably three or four ofthem will work out you know at differentstages of the disease to reduce therespiratory distressI heard you mention that one possibilitymight be treatments from the serum theblood serum of people who had had thedisease and recovered so I guess they'recarrying antibodies talk a bit aboutthat about how that could work and whatit would take to accelerate that yeahthis has always been discussed is howcould you pull that off so people whoare recovered it appears have reallyeffective antibodies in their blood soyou could go transfuse them and onlytake out the the white cells the immunecells and then the question is okay howmany patients worth of material couldyou get you know if you have thatrecovered person come in say once a weekdo you get enough for two people or fivepeople then logistically you have totake that and get it to where that needis and so it's it's fairly complicatedif you know compared to a drug that wecan make and high-volumeyou know the cost of taking it out andputting it back in probably doesn'tscale as well but there's what there iswork being done on this it you know weactually started with the bowlunfortunately it got done before it wasneeded so that is being pursued andit'll work to some degree but it'll behard to to scale the numbers so it'salmost like when you when you talk aboutthe need to accelerate testing theimmediate need is for testing for thevirus but is it possible that in a fewmonths time that there's been me thisgrowing need to test for theseantibodies and people - I need to see ifsomeone had the disease and recoveredmaybe they didn't even know they theyhad it because you could picture thisgrowing worldwide force of heroes let'scall them heroes who've been throughthis experience and have a lot to offerthe world maybe maybe they can offer youknow like blood blood donations herenation but also other tasks like ifyou've got overwhelmed health caresystems presumably there are kind ofcommunity health worker type tasks thatpeople could be trained to do to relievethe pressure that if we knew that theywere as effectively immune yes until wecame up with the South swab and showedFDA that that's equivalent we werethinking the people who might be able toman those kiosks would be the recoveredpatients now we don't want to have a lotof recovered people you know to be clearwe're trying through the shutdown in theUnited States to not get to 1% of thepopulation infected we're well belowthat today but with exponentiation youknow you could get past that about 3million i'm i believe we will be able toavoid that with the having this economicpain eventually what we'll have to havea certificates of who's a recoveredperson who's a vaccinated person becauseyou don't want people moving around theworld where you'll have some countriesthat won't have it under control sadlyyou don't want to completely block offthe ability for those you know people togo there and come back and move aroundbill is your foundation helping toaccelerate the manufacture of these selftests what are the prospects for reallyseeing scale and some of this testingsoon not just a new s but that butglobally yeah our foundation we'd beenfunding a thing called the flu study toreally understand how respiratoryviruses spread it's amazing how littlewas understood about how importantschools are different age groupsdifferent types of interaction and thatgave us an experience in fact that flustudy actually was the first time coronavirus was found in the community becausethe government was still saying you onlytest people who come from china but weran into people who had chronic viruswho weren't hadn't been travelers so youknow that was like an early warning signeven though the regulation said youweren't supposed to even look at that soyeah the foundation isworking with all the private sectorpeople the Diagnostics people on thistesting piece the now that we can do theself swab those swabs are very easy tomanufacture the one where you had tojamming into the throat deep turbinatethat was getting into short supply sothe swab you know should not be limitingneither should the the various chemicalsthat help run the the PCR machine so wewe should be able to get to a SouthKorea type prioritized testing thingwithin within a few weeks how importantis it that the world's nationscollaborate right now I mean it's youknow it's like you know here's thiscommon enemy facing humanity it does notknow that it just crossed a border itdoes not know what race people are whatreligion they are it just knows here's ahuman I've got I've got I've got amanufacturing machine here that can makeme famous and and it goes to work hait's so terrifying to me to see signs ofdoubt of countries starting to blameeach other or you know that thexenophobia just seems so toxic how doyou how what's your take on this bill isthere anything do you see signs ofcooperation happening or are you alsoworried about the sort of us versusChina kind of thing that seems to begoing on if we're not careful well I seeboth I see that countries that arerecovered can help other countries andthat you know that's fantasticif by the summer we've knocked thisthing down then great we can help othercountries there are vaccine projects allover the world the nose should beevaluated on a very neutral basis towhich one is the the best to helphumanity and make sure the manufacturingcapacity isn't just for rich countriesthat had scaled up very low cost uh forthe entire world and that's the spiritof Gavi is getting vaccines out to everyperson so you see really good in thescience side anddata sharing side you see this greatcooperation going on unfortunatelywhenever you have disease this sense ofother and foreign and no stay away fromme are you know that sort of pullinginward is reinforced and we have toavoid that you know ironically we haveto isolate physically while in terms oflooking at community groups that arepooling resources to help make sure foodgets to everyone and helps your medicalcare and that you know if older peopleneed to be moved out of commonfacilities you help out with that andyou know people aren't suffering toomuch from the psychology of isolation soour generosity has to go out towardsothers at the same time or less actuallyphysically in interacting with otherpeople I mean thinking about thesituation in many developing countriesI'm curious how you think of this I meanyou mentioned festival that seasonalitymay help ie high temperatures is itpossible that that is so far protectingpace to some extent places like India orsub-saharan Africa and so forth inindia's northern hemisphere so southernhemisphere is lots of Africa SouthAmerica Australia New Zealand Indonesiaand it is true either they're not theeither the force of infection is lowerthere we're just not seeing it withtesting you know a few months from nowwe'll understand the seasonalityquestion which would be good news forthe northern hemisphere and somewhat badnews for the summit hemisphere now morepeople live in the northern hemisphereincluding you know India Pakistan andthat would buy us some time the time isa big deal because all these tools getso much better if you had to go into asecond season with it but yes sadly wecould see in the next few months is thesouthern hemisphere is moving into it'sa fall and then winter we could see abig increase there and and that is goingto be very difficult now they don't haveas many older people but they have lotspeople who have four hiv-positive or howabout nutrition are various lungchallenges because of indoor smoke andso the wild card is how well can thedeveloping countries deal with this Imean if you're in a country where youhave the majority of your populationsmaking less than two or three dollars aday can you even afford a strategy thatlooks looks like basically shutting downthe economy I'm very worried that therewill be a massive number of deaths inthose poor countries because the healthsystems just aren't you know the numberof respirators hospitals and of coursewhen you overload that system yourdeaths are not just koba deaths but theeveryone else who's trying to access asystem that will be somewhat in chaosincluding with health workers who aregetting sick okay we're getting near torunning out of time of this wouldn't itmaybe allows the question or two fromonline sure so we have two from onlinewe're seeing thousands of questionsaround these same lines one there's lotsof people who are really interested tohear about the kind of work that you'redoing with your foundation as far asdistributing tests but also producing atproducing safety gear masks and thatsort of thing to help with this effortfor health workers yeah so the GatesFoundationyou know we very early on gave out ahundred million to help out with all thepieces the testing piece thetherapeutics and the vaccines we are notexperts in making masks and ventilatorsand gowns and it's great that otherpeople including some 3d printing andopen source things that is greatour focus you know like these self swabthing it you know nobody had done thatbefore people thought it wouldn't workwe were quite sure it would work and sothat for the globe is a huge thing wework a lot with both governments onprivate sector so in some ways we'rekind of a bridge and you know so we'vebeen talking to the head of thepharmaceutical companies and the testingcompanies and specifically with the onesdoing vaccines including some of whichare these newthe vaccines are na vaccines that we'vebeen backing you know for quite sometime and sepi has been backing and soour expertise are is in those medicaltools and really getting the best of theprivate sector engaged there it's been alittle slow we can write checks you knowright away whereas the governmentprocesses even in this situation youknow there's still this notion ofbidding and not really knowing who hasthe unique capabilities of doing thingsand you know so an organization that'sworking on this all the time lots of newvaccines can step in and and and behelpful and it's really amazing when wetalk to private sector partners theirinterest in helping out is has beenabsolutely fantastic and you know sothat's where we're we have a unique rolethat's great and I mean and the otherquestion that we're just seeing a ton ofbefore we wrap up here is is it's justpeople are really interested in yourinsight bill on whether you think we'reheading in the right direction do youfeel like our economy is heading in theright place that humanity is heading inthe right place are we in a betterposition now than you thought we were infive years ago well the five years ago Isaid that the pandemic is thisunaddressed very very scary thing andthat you know if we did the right thingswe could be more prepared science is onour side the the fact we can be readyfor the next epidemic it's very clearhow to do that and yes it will take tensof billions but not hundreds ortrillions of dollars so it'll be tinycompared to the economic cost I rememberwhen I did that presentation of 2015 Iput up a hey you know a big flu epidemiccould cost four trillion I thought wowthat's a big number do I really thinkit's that big and I went and took themurse I thought yeah well that that'sbig this epidemic will cost that much tothe economy so in the short run we aregoing to have more pain and moredifficultyand people are going to have to step upto help each other I'm still very muchan optimist you know whether its climatechange countries working togetherbiology taking the diseases malaria TByou know even advances for what are moreritual diseases like cancer the amountof innovation the way we can connect upand work together yesI'm super positive about that you know Ilove my work because I see progress onall these diseases all the time now wehave to you know turn and and focus onthis you know sadly it may interrupt andthe polio situation might get worse alittle bit because of the distractionhere you know we're using a lot of thegreat capacity that was built up forthose polio activities to try and helpthe developing countries respond to thisvery well and that that is appropriatebut you know the message for me althoughit's very sober when we're dealing withthis epidemicyou know I'm I'm very positive that thisshould draw us together we will get outof this and then we will get ready forthe next epidemic that's that's exactlywhat I was going to ask you fellas whichis a help where's your head do you thinkwe that we will get through this willthe leaders that matter listen to thescientists will they will we make itthrough did you believe that within afew months time we're going to bealready looking back and saying wedodged a pretty bad one there we can'tsay for sure that even the richcountries will be out of this in six toten weeksI think that's likely but as we get thetesting data we'll get more of a senseof that and people continuously be ableto see that but you know the richcountries will got out of this thedeveloping countries will bear asignificant price but even they we willget a vaccine and you know Gavi we'llget that out to to everyone so you knowtwo to three years from now this thingeven on a global basis will essentiallybe/ with a gigantic price tag but nowwe're gonna know okay next time we see apathogen we can make billions of testswithin two or three weeks we can figureout which antiviral drugs work withintwo or three weeks and get those killedup and we can make a vaccine if we'rereally ready probably in six monthsusing these new platforms probably theRNA vaccine so specifically there areinnovations that are there that will getfinanced you know I hope quitegenerously coming out of this thing andso three years from now we'll look backand say you know that was awful there'sa lot of heroes but we've learned thelesson and and the world as a wholewith its great science and desire tohelp each other was able to try andminimize what happened there and and andyou know avoid it happening again thatcertainly the optimistic scenario thatI'm craving for myself that the worldkind of realizes one that there arecertain things that you just have tounite on to that science really mattersand that side that it's a miracle thatscience can understand this bug you knowmake a vaccine in the sequencer to maketherapeutics understand how to model itit's kind of miraculous to me so will welearn now to that to pay attention toscientists because if we do I I'm surethat you feel this as well there's anamazing analog right with climate it'sjust a different timescale that thescientists are out there saying there'sthis huge enemy coming if we do nothingit's going to take millions of livesit's going to wreck our planet for God'ssake at politicians do something and thepoliticians are going no need littlemore GDP we need to win an election andthey're not acting mate I mean is thatdo you see a scenario where this shockspoliticians to actually change theirthinking and their prioritization ofscience that we're all at that askingtoo much yeah it's interesting how muchof this distraction will delay theurgent innovation agendathat exists over in climate you know Ihave freed up a lot of time to work onclimate I have to say you know for thelast few months that's now shifted anduntil we get out of this crisisCobin will dominate and so some of theclimate stuff although it'll still go onit won't get that same focus is we getpast this yes that I did innovation inscience and the world working togetherthat is totally common between these twoproblems and so I don't think this hasto be a huge setback for climate so lastquestion there there are thousands ofpeople watching many of them livingalone some quote scared they're makingthese people that who have this virusand suffering symptoms are recovering bythe way if that's if that's you we'dlove to hear from youwe really would maybe have aconversation with some of you have justyou know in a future one of these justunderstanding the experience but billwhat can people do as individuals fromtheir own homes right now to try andhelp well there's a lot of creativityyou know can you mentor kids who arebeing forced into an online format wherethe school systems really weren't readyfor that can youorganize some giving activity that getsthe you know the food banks to step upwhere there's problems there these aresuch unprecedent at times and it reallyshould draw out that that sense of youknow creativity Wow complying with theisolation mandates well bill I reallywant to thank you for spending this thistime with us and for the the financialinvestment the time investment you'vereally invested your life into trying tosolve these big problems and this is asbig as they get I have a hunch that yourvoice is really gonna be needed in thenext few weeks thank you so much foryour for your time today this was thiswas really wonderful hearing from youthank you you know thanks Chris okaywell thanks everyone thanks for beingpart of the tech community look afteryourselves to be smart about this youknow it's like get ahead of it if you'rein a part of the world where this thinghasn't really hit listen to Bill Gatesget ahead of it to keep you know it justif you possibly cansocially a distance not not physicallydistance and socially connect that'swhat the internet is for these days arewhat the internet was built for we canspread love we can spread ideas we canspread relationship we can spreadthought without spreading a dangerousbug so get ahead of it and let's figurethis out together it's been wonderfulspending time with you from Whitney andfor me and from the whole Ted team thankyou",

George Washington Carversays all learning is understandingrelationships everyone in this room hasbeen affected by a teacher or an adultfor years I have watched people teach Ihave looked at the best and I've lookedat some of the worst a colleague said tome one time they don't pay me to likethe kids they pay me to teach a lessonthe kid should learn it I should teachit they should learn it case closedwell I said to her you know kids don'tlearn from people they don't likeshe said that's just a bunch of hooeyand I said to her well your year isgoing to be long and arduous dearneedless to say it was some people thinkthat you can either have it in you tobuild a relationship or you don't Ithink Steven Covey had the right idea hesaid you oughta just throw in a fewsimple things like seeking first tounderstand as opposed to beingunderstoodsimple things like apologizing you everthought about that tell a kid you'resorry they're in shockI taught a lesson once on ratios I'm notreal good with math but I was working onit and I got back and looked at thatteacher edition I taught the wholelesson wrong so I came back to class thenext day and I said look guys I need toapologize I taught the whole lessonwrong I'm so sorry I said that's okaymiss Pearson you were so excited we justlet you goI have had classes that were so low soacademically deficient that I cried Iwondered how am I going to take thisgroup in nine months from where they areto where they need to be and it wasdifficult it was it was awfully hard howdo I raise the self-esteem of a child inhis academic achievement at the sametime one year I came up with a brightidea I told all my students you werechosen to be in my class because I amthe best teacher and you are the beststudents they put us all together so wecould show everybody else how to do itone of the students say really I saidreally we have to show the other classeshow to do it so when we walk down thehall people will notice us so you can'tmake noise you just have to strut and Igave them a saying to say I am somebodyI was somebody when I came out be abetter somebody when I leave I ampowerful and I am strong I deserve theeducation that I get here I have thingsto do people to impress and places to goand they said yeahyou say it long enough it starts to be apart of you and soI gave a quiz 20 questions studentmissed 18 I put a +2 on this paper and abig smiley face he said Miss Pearson isdifferent F I said yes he said thenwhy'd you put a smiley face I said cuzyou on the roll you got to write youdidn't miss them all I said and when wereview this won't you do betterhe said yes ma'am I can do better yousee minus 18 sucks all the life out ofyouplus 2 that ain't all bad for years Iwatched my mother take the time atrecess to review go on home visits inthe afternoon by combs and brushes andpeanut butter and crackers to put in adesk drawer for kids that needed to eatand washcloths and some soap for thekids too it didn't smell so good seeit's hard to teach kids who stink andkids can be cruel and so she kept thosethings in her desk and years later aftershe retired I watched some of those samekids come through and say to her youknow Miss Walker you made a differencein my life you made it work for me youmade me feel like I was somebody when Iknew at the bottom I wasn't and I wantyou to just see what I've become andwhen my momma died two years ago at 92there were so many former students ather funeral it brought tears to my eyesnot because she was gone but because sheleft the legacy of relationships thatcould never disappear can we stand tohave more relationships absolutely willyou like all your children of course notand you know your toughest kids arenever absent never you won't like themall and and and the tough ones show upfor a reason it's the connection it'sthe relationships and while you won'tlike them all the key is they can neverever know it so teachers become greatactors and great actresses and we cometo work when we don't feel like it andwe listening to policy that doesn't makesense and we teach anyway we teachanyway because that's what we doteaching and learning should bring joyhow powerful would our world be if wehad kids who who were not afraid to takerisk who were not afraid to think andwho had a champion every child deservesa champion an adult who will never giveup on them who understands the power ofconnection and insist that they becomethe best that they can possibly be isthis job tough you betchaoh god you betcha but it is notimpossible we can do this we'reeducators we're born to make adifference thank you[Applause][Music]",

   "title": "The magic of Fibonacci numbers | Arthur Benjamin",
   "publishedAt": "08 Nov 2013",
   "transcription": "So why do we learn mathematics?Essentially, for three reasons:calculation,application,and last, and unfortunately leastin terms of the time we give it,inspiration.Mathematics is the science of patterns,and we study it to learn how to think logically,critically and creatively,but too much of the mathematicsthat we learn in schoolis not effectively motivated,and when our students ask,\"Why are we learning this?\"then they often hear that they'll need itin an upcoming math class or on a future test.But wouldn't it be greatif every once in a while we did mathematicssimply because it was fun or beautifulor because it excited the mind?Now, I know many people have nothad the opportunity to see how this can happen,so let me give you a quick examplewith my favorite collection of numbers,the Fibonacci numbers. (Applause)Yeah! I already have Fibonacci fans here.That's great.Now these numbers can be appreciatedin many different ways.From the standpoint of calculation,they're as easy to understandas one plus one, which is two.Then one plus two is three,two plus three is five, three plus five is eight,and so on.Indeed, the person we call Fibonacciwas actually named Leonardo of Pisa,and these numbers appear in his book \"Liber Abaci,\"which taught the Western worldthe methods of arithmetic that we use today.In terms of applications,Fibonacci numbers appear in naturesurprisingly often.The number of petals on a floweris typically a Fibonacci number,or the number of spirals on a sunfloweror a pineappletends to be a Fibonacci number as well.In fact, there are many moreapplications of Fibonacci numbers,but what I find most inspirational about themare the beautiful number patterns they display.Let me show you one of my favorites.Suppose you like to square numbers,and frankly, who doesn't? (Laughter)Let's look at the squaresof the first few Fibonacci numbers.So one squared is one,two squared is four, three squared is nine,five squared is 25, and so on.Now, it's no surprisethat when you add consecutive Fibonacci numbers,you get the next Fibonacci number. Right?That's how they're created.But you wouldn't expect anything specialto happen when you add the squares together.But check this out.One plus one gives us two,and one plus four gives us five.And four plus nine is 13,nine plus 25 is 34,and yes, the pattern continues.In fact, here's another one.Suppose you wanted to look atadding the squares ofthe first few Fibonacci numbers.Let's see what we get there.So one plus one plus four is six.Add nine to that, we get 15.Add 25, we get 40.Add 64, we get 104.Now look at those numbers.Those are not Fibonacci numbers,but if you look at them closely,you'll see the Fibonacci numbersburied inside of them.Do you see it? I'll show it to you.Six is two times three, 15 is three times five,40 is five times eight,two, three, five, eight, who do we appreciate?(Laughter)Fibonacci! Of course.Now, as much fun as it is to discover these patterns,it's even more satisfying to understandwhy they are true.Let's look at that last equation.Why should the squares of one, one,two, three, five and eightadd up to eight times 13?I'll show you by drawing a simple picture.We'll start with a one-by-one squareand next to that put another one-by-one square.Together, they form a one-by-two rectangle.Beneath that, I'll put a two-by-two square,and next to that, a three-by-three square,beneath that, a five-by-five square,and then an eight-by-eight square,creating one giant rectangle, right?Now let me ask you a simple question:what is the area of the rectangle?Well, on the one hand,it's the sum of the areasof the squares inside it, right?Just as we created it.It's one squared plus one squaredplus two squared plus three squaredplus five squared plus eight squared. Right?That's the area.On the other hand, because it's a rectangle,the area is equal to its height times its base,and the height is clearly eight,and the base is five plus eight,which is the next Fibonacci number, 13. Right?So the area is also eight times 13.Since we've correctly calculated the areatwo different ways,they have to be the same number,and that's why the squares of one,one, two, three, five and eightadd up to eight times 13.Now, if we continue this process,we'll generate rectangles of the form 13 by 21,21 by 34, and so on.Now check this out.If you divide 13 by eight,you get 1.625.And if you divide the larger numberby the smaller number,then these ratios get closer and closerto about 1.618,known to many people as the Golden Ratio,a number which has fascinated mathematicians,scientists and artists for centuries.Now, I show all this to you because,like so much of mathematics,there's a beautiful side to itthat I fear does not get enough attentionin our schools.We spend lots of time learning about calculation,but let's not forget about application,including, perhaps, the mostimportant application of all,learning how to think.If I could summarize this in one sentence,it would be this:Mathematics is not just solving for x,it's also figuring out why.Thank you very much.(Applause)",

   "transcription": "what do you think when you look at me awoman of faith an expert maybe even asister or oppressed brainwashed aterrorist or just an airport securityline delay that that one's actually trueif some of your perceptions werenegative I don't really blame you that'sjust how the media has been portrayingpeople who look like me one study foundthat 80% of news coverage about Islamand Muslims is negative and studies showthat Americans say that most don't knowa Muslim I guess people don't talk totheir uber drivers well for those of youwho've never met a Muslim it's great tomeet youlet me tell you who I am I'm a mom acoffee loverdouble espresso cream on the side I'm anintrovert I'm a wannabe fitness fanaticand I'm a practicing spiritual Muslimbut not like Lady Gaga says because babyI wasn't born this way it was a choicewhen I was 17 I decided to come out nonot as a gay person like some of myfriends but as a Muslim and decided tostart wearing the hijab my head coveringmy feminist friends were aghastwhy are you opressing yourself the funnything was it was actually at that time afeminist declaration of independencefrom the pressure I felt as a 17 yearold to conform to a perfect andunattainable standard of beautyI didn't just passively accept the faithof my parents Iwrestled with the Quran I read andreflected and questioned and doubted andultimately believed my relationship withGod it was not love at first sight itwas a trust and a slow surrender thatdeepened with every reading of the Quranits rhythmic beauty sometimes moves meto tears I see myself in it I feel thatGod knows me have you ever felt likesomeone sees you completely understandsyou and yet loves you anyway that's howit feels and so later I got married andlike all good Egyptians started mycareer as an engineer I later had achild after getting married and I wasliving essentially the Egyptian AmericanDream and then that terrible morning ofSeptember 2001 I think a lot of youprobably remember exactly where you werethat morning I was sitting in my kitchenfinishing breakfast I look up on thescreen and see the words breaking newsthere was smoke airplanes flying intobuildings people jumping out ofbuildings what was this an accident amalfunction my shock quickly turned tooutrage who would do this I switched thechannelI hear Muslim terrorists in the name ofIslam Middle Eastern descent do you hidewe should bomb Mecca oh my god not onlyhad my country been attacked but in aflash somebody else's actions had turnedme from a citizen to a suspectthat same day we had to drive acrossmiddle America to move to a new city tostart grad school and I remember sittingin the passenger seat as we drove insilence crouched as low as I could go inmy seat for the first time in my lifeafraid for anyone to know I was a Muslimwe moved into our apartment that nightin a new town and what felt like acompletely different world and then Iwas hearing and seeing and readingwarnings from National Muslimorganizations saying things like bealert be aware stay in well-lit areasdon't congregate I stayed inside allweek and then it was Friday that sameweek the day that Muslims congregate forworship and again the warnings weredon't go that first Friday it could be atarget and I was watching the newswall-to-wall coverage emotions were soraw understandably and I was alsohearing about attacks on Muslims orpeople who were perceived to be Muslimbeing pulled out and beaten in thestreet mosques were actually fire bombedand I thought we should just stay homeand yet something didn't feel rightbecause those people who attacked ourcountry attacked our country I get itthat people were angry at the terroristsguess what so was I and so to have toexplain yourself all the time isn't easyI don't mind questions I love questionsit's the accusations that are toughtoday we hear people actually sayingthings like there's a problem in thiscountry and it's called Muslims when arewe going to get rid of them so somepeople want to ban Muslims and closedown mosques they talk about mycommunity kind of like were a tumor inthe body of America and the onlyquestion is are we malignant or benign9 you know a malignant tumor you extractall together and a benign tumoryou just keep under surveillance thechoices don't make sense because it'sthe wrong question Muslims like allother Americans aren't a tumor in thebody of America or a vital organ Muslimsare inventors and teachers firstresponders and Olympic athletes now isclosing down Moss going to make Americasafer it might free up some parkingspots but it will not end terrorismgoing to a mosque regularly is actuallylinked to having more tolerant views ofpeople of other faiths and greater civicengagement and as one police chief inthe Washington DC area recently told mepeople don't actually get radicalized atmosques they get radicalized in theirbasement or bedroom in front of acomputer and what you find about theradicalization process is it startsonline but the first thing that happensis the person gets cut off from theircommunity from even their family so thatthe extremist group can brainwash theminto believing that they the terroristsare the true Muslims and everyone elsewho abhors their behavior and ideologyare sellouts or apostates so if we wantto prevent radicalization we have tokeep people going to the mosque now somewill still argue Islam is a violentreligion after all a group like Isisbases its brutality on the Koran now asa Muslim as a mother as a human being Ithink we need to do everything we can tostop a group like Isis but we would begiving in to their narrative if we castthem as representatives of a faith of1.6 billion peopleIsis has as much to do with Islam as theKu Klux Klan has to do with Christianityboth groups claim to base their ideologyon their holy book but when you look atthem they're not motivated by what theyread in their holy book it's theirbrutality that makes them read thesethings into the scripture recently aprominent Imam told me a story thatreally took me aback he said that a girlcame to him because she was thinking ofgoing to join Isis and I was I wasreally surprised and asked him had shebeen in contact with a radical religiousleader he said the problem was quite theoppositethat every cleric that she had talked tohad shut her down and said that her rageher sense of injustice in the world wasjust going to get her in trouble and sowith nowhere to channel and make senseof this anger she was a prime target tobe exploited by extremists promising hersolution what does he mem did was toconnect her back to God into hercommunity he didn't shame her for herrage instead he gave her constructiveways to make real change in the worldwhat she learned that that mosqueprevented her from going to join IsisI've told you a little bit about howIslamophobia affects me and my familybut how does it impact ordinaryAmericans how does it impact everyoneelse how it is consuming fear 24 hours aday affect the health of our democracythe health of our free thought well onestudy actually several studies inneuroscience show that when we're afraidat least three things happen we becomemore accepting of authoritarianismconformity and Prejudice one studyshowed that when subjects were exposedto new stories that were negative aboutMuslims they became more accepting ofmilitary attacks onsome countries and policies that curtailthe rights of American Muslims now thisisn't just academic when you look atwhen anti-muslim sentiment spikedbetween 2001 and 2013 it happened threetimes but it wasn't around terroristattacks it was in the run-up to the Iraqwar and during two election cycles soSlama phobia isn't just the naturalresponse to Muslim terrorism as I wouldwould have expected it can actually be atool of public manipulation eroding thevery foundation of a free society whichis rational and well informed citizensMuslims are like Canaries in the coalmine we might be the first to feel itbut the toxic air of fear is harming usalland assigning collective guilt isn'tjust about having explained yourself allthe timedia and his wife Yost were a youngmarried couple living in Chapel HillNorth Carolina where they both went toschool Diaw was a an athlete and he wasin dental school talented promising andhis sister would tell me that he was thesweetest most generous human being sheknew she was visiting him there and heshowed her his resume and she was amazedshe said when did my baby brother becomesuch an accomplished young man just afew weeks after Suzanne's visit to herbrother and his new wife their neighborCraig Stephen Hicks murdered them aswell as yo sister Roseanne who isvisiting for the afternoon in theirapartment execution-style after postinganti-muslim statements on his Facebookpage he shot Leo eight times so bigotryisn't just immoral it can even be lethalso back to my story what happened after9/11 did we go to the mosque or did weplay it safe and stay home well wetalked it over and it might seem like asmall decision but to us it was aboutwhat kind of America we wanted to leavefor our kids one that would control usby fear or one where we were practicingour religion freely so we decided to goto the mosque and we put my son in hiscar seat buckled him in and we drovesilently intensely to the mosque and Itook him out I took off my shoes Iwalked into the prayer hall and what Isaw made me stop the place wascompletely full and then the ax men madean announcement thinking and welcomingour guests because half the congregationwere Christians Jews Buddhists atheistspeople of faith and no faith would comenot to attack us but to stand insolidarity with usI just break down at this time thesepeople were there because they chosecourage and compassion over panic andPrejudice what will you choose what willyou choose at this time of fear andbigotry will you play it safe or willyou join those who say we are betterthan that thank youand this oneso Dahlia you seem to have struck achord but I wonder what would you say tothose who might argue that you're givinga TED talk you're clearly a deep thinkeryou work at a fancy think-tank you're anexception you're not the rule what wouldyou say to those people I would saydon't let this stage distract you I'mcompletely ordinary I'm not an exceptionmy story is not unusual I am as asordinary as they come when you look atMuslim Muslims around the world and andI've done this I've done the largeststudy ever done on Muslims around theworld people want ordinary things theywant prosperity for their family theywant jobs and they want to live in peaceso I am not in any way an exception whenyou meet people who seem like anexception to the rule oftentimes it'sthat the rule is broken not that they'rean exception to thank you so much thankyou so much valium oh go aheadyou",

teaching others how to financiallymanage money and invest I soon learnedthat I had to take responsibility for myown actions true I grew up in a verycomplex environment but I chose tocommit crimes and I had to own up tothat I had to take responsibility forthat and I did I was building acurriculum that could teach incarceratedmen how to manage money through prisonemployments properly managing ourlifestyle will provide transferabletools that we can use to manage moneywhen we enter society like the majorityof people did who didn't commit crimesthen I discovered that according tomarket watch over 60% of the Americanpopulation has under $1,000 in savingsSports Illustrated said that over 60% ofNBA players and interfere players gobroke 40% of marital problems derivedfrom financial issues what the hellyou mean to tell me that people worktheir whole lives buying cars clotheshomes and material stuff where wouldliving check the checkhi in the world remember some societygoing to help incarcerated individualsback into society if they couldn'tmanage their own stuff we screwed Ineeded a better plan this is not gonnawork out too well so I thought I now hadan obligation to meet those

   "title": "Making peace is a marathon | May El-Khalil",
   "publishedAt": "16 Aug 2013",
   "transcription": "I come from Lebanon,and I believe that runningcan change the world.I know what I have just saidis simply not obvious.You know, Lebanon as a countryhas been once destroyedby a long and bloody civil war.Honestly, I don't knowwhy they call it civil warwhen there is nothing civil about it.With Syria to the north,Israel and Palestine to the south,and our governmenteven up till this momentis still fragmented and unstable.For years, the country has been dividedbetween politics and religion.However, for one day a year,we truly stand united,and that's when the marathon takes place.I used to be a marathon runner.Long distance runningwas not only good for my well-beingbut it helped me meditate and dream big.So the longer distances I ran,the bigger my dreams became.Until one fateful morning,and while training, I was hit by a bus.I nearly died, was in a coma,stayed at the hospital for two years,and underwent 36 surgeriesto be able to walk again.As soon as I came out of my coma,I realized that I was no longerthe same runner I used to be,so I decided, if I couldn't run myself,I wanted to make sure that others could.So out of my hospital bed,I asked my husband to start taking notes,and a few months later,the marathon was born.Organizing a marathonas a reaction to an accidentmay sound strange,but at that time, even duringmy most vulnerable condition,I needed to dream big.I needed somethingto take me out of my pain,an objective to look forward to.I didn't want to pity myself,nor to be pitied,and I thought by organizingsuch a marathon,I'll be able to pay back to my community,build bridges with the outside world,and invite runners to come to Lebanonand run under the umbrella of peace.Organizing a marathon in Lebanonis definitely not like organizingone in New York.How do you introducethe concept of runningto a nation that is constantlyat the brink of war?How do you ask thosewho were once fightingand killing each otherto come together and runnext to each other?More than that, how do you convince peopleto run a distance of 26.2 milesat a time they were not even familiarwith the word \"marathon\"?So we had to start from scratch.For almost two years,we went all over the countryand even visited remote villages.I personally met with peoplefrom all walks of life --mayors, NGOs, schoolchildren,politicians, militiamen,people from mosques, churches,the president of the country,even housewives.I learned one thing:When you walk the talk,people believe you.Many were touched by my personal story,and they shared their stories in return.It was honesty and transparencythat brought us together.We spoke one common languageto each other,and that was from one human to another.Once that trust was built,everybody wantedto be part of the marathonto show the world the true colorsof Lebanon and the Lebaneseand their desire to livein peace and harmony.In October 2003, over 6,000 runnersfrom 49 different nationalitiescame to the start line, all determined,and when the gunfire went off,this time it was a signalto run in harmony,for a change.The marathon grew.So did our political problems.But for every disaster we had,the marathon found waysto bring people together.In 2005, our prime ministerwas assassinated,and the country cameto a complete standstill,so we organized a five-kilometerUnited We Run campaign.Over 60,000 people came to the start line,all wearing white T-shirtswith no political slogans.That was a turning point for the marathon,where people startedlooking at it as a platformfor peace and unity.Between 2006 up to 2009,our country, Lebanon,went through unstable years,invasions, and more assassinationsthat brought us close to a civil war.The country was divided again,so much that our parliament resigned,we had no president for a year,and no prime minister.But we did have a marathon.(Applause)So through the marathon, we learnedthat political problems can be overcome.When the opposition party decidedto shut down part of the city center,we negotiated alternative routes.Government protestersbecame sideline cheerleaders.They even hosted juice stations.(Laughter)You know, the marathonhas really become one of its kind.It gained credibilityfrom both the Lebaneseand the international community.Last November 2012, over 33,000 runnersfrom 85 different nationalitiescame to the start line,but this time, they challengeda very stormy and rainy weather.The streets were flooded,but people didn't want to miss outon the opportunity of being partof such a national day.BMA has expanded.We include everyone:the young, the elderly,the disabled, the mentally challenged,the blind, the elite, the amateur runners,even moms with their babies.Themes have includedruns for the environment,breast cancer, for the loveof Lebanon, for peace,or just simply to run.The first annual all-women-and-girlsrace for empowerment,which is one of its kind in the region,has just taken place only a few weeks ago,with 4,512 women,including the first lady,and this is only the beginning.Thank you.(Applause)BMA has supported charities and volunteerswho have helped reshape Lebanon,raising funds for their causesand encouraging others to give.The culture of giving and doing goodhas become contagious.Stereotypes have been broken.Change-makers and future leadershave been created.I believe these are the building blocksfor future peace.BMA has become such a respectedevent in the regionthat government officials in the region,like Iraq, Egypt and Syria,have asked the organization to help themstructure a similar sporting event.We are now one of the largestrunning events in the Middle East,but most importantly,it is a platform for hope and cooperationin an ever-fragileand unstable part of the world.From Boston to Beirut, we stand as one.(Applause)After 10 years in Lebanon,from national marathonsor from national eventsto smaller regional races,we've seen that people wantto run for a better future.After all, peacemaking is not a sprint.It is more of a marathon.Thank you.(Applause)",

   "title": "How I hacked online dating | Amy Webb",
   "publishedAt": "02 Oct 2013",
   "transcription": "So my name is Amy Webb,and a few years agoI found myself at the endof yet another fantastic relationshipthat came burning downin a spectacular fashion.And I thought, what's wrong with me?I don't understandwhy this keeps happening.So I asked everybody in my lifewhat they thought.I turned to my grandmother,who always had plenty of advice,and she said, \"Stop being so picky.You've got to date around.And most importantly,true love will find youwhen you least expect it.\"Now as it turns out,I'm somebody who thinks a lot about data,as you'll soon find.I am constantly swimmingin numbers, formulas and charts.I also have a very tight-knit family,and I'm very, very close with my sister,and as a result, I wanted to havethe same type of family when I grew up.So I'm at the end of this bad breakup,I'm 30 years old,I figure I'm probably going to haveto date somebody for about six monthsbefore I'm ready to get monogamousand before we can sort of cohabitate,and we have to do thatfor a while before we can get engaged.And if I want to start having childrenby the time I'm 35,that meant that I would havehad to have been on my way to marriagefive years ago.So that wasn't going to work.If my strategy was to least-expectmy way into true love,then the variable that I hadto deal with was serendipity.In short, I was trying to figure outwhat's the probabilityof my finding Mr. Right?Well, at the time I was livingin the city of Philadelphia,and it's a big city, and I figured,in this entire place,there are lots of possibilities.So again, I started doing some math.Population of Philadelphia:it has 1.5 million people.I figure about half of that are men,so that takes the number down to 750,000.I'm looking for a guybetween the ages of 30 and 36,which was only four percentof the population,so now I'm dealingwith the possibility of 30,000 men.I was looking for somebody who was Jewish,because I am and that was important to me.That's only 2.3 percent of the population.I figure I'm attracted to maybeone out of 10 of those men,and there was no way I was going to dealwith somebody who was an avid golfer.So that basically meantthere were 35 men for methat I could possibly datein the entire city of Philadelphia.In the meantime,my very large Jewish familywas already all marriedand well on their wayto having lots and lots of children,and I felt like I wasunder tremendous peer pressureto get my life going already.So I have two possiblestrategies at this pointI'm sort of figuring out.One, I can take my grandmother's adviceand sort of least-expect my wayinto maybe bumping into the oneout of 35 possible menin the entire 1.5-million-personcity of Philadelphia,or I could try online dating.Now, I like the idea of online dating,because it's predicated on an algorithm,and that's really justa simple way of sayingI've got a problem,I'm going to use some data,run it through a systemand get to a solution.So online dating is the secondmost popular waythat people now meet each other,but as it turns out,algorithms have been aroundfor thousands of yearsin almost every culture.In fact, in Judaism,there were matchmakers a long time ago,and though they didn't havean explicit algorithm per se,they definitely were runningthrough formulas in their heads,like, is the girl going to like the boy?Are the families going to get along?What's the rabbi going to say?Are they going to starthaving children right away?The matchmaker would sortof think through all of this,put two people together,and that would be the end of it.So in my case, I thought,well, will data and an algorithmlead me to my Prince Charming?So I decided to sign on.Now, there was one small catch.As I'm signing on to the variousdating websites,as it happens, I was really, really busy.But that actuallywasn't the biggest problem.The biggest problem is that I hatefilling out questionnaires of any kind,and I certainly don't like questionnairesthat are like Cosmo quizzes.So I just copiedand pasted from my r\u00e9sum\u00e9.(Laughter)So in the descriptive part up top,I said that I wasan award-winning journalistand a future thinker.When I was asked about fun activitiesand my ideal date,I said monetizationand fluency in Japanese.I talked a lot about JavaScript.(Laughter)So obviously this was not the best wayto put my most sexy foot forward.But the real failure was thatthere were plenty of men for me to date.These algorithms had a sea full of menthat wanted to take me outon lots of dates --what turned out to be truly awful dates.There was this guy Steve, the I.T. guy.The algorithm matched us upbecause we share a love of gadgets,we share a love of mathand data and '80s music,and so I agreed to go out with him.So Steve the I.T. guy invited me outto one of Philadelphia'swhite-table-cloth,extremely expensive restaurants.And we went in, and right off the bat,our conversation reallywasn't taking flight,but he was ordering a lot of food.In fact, he didn't even botherlooking at the menu.He was ordering multiple appetizers,multiple entr\u00e9es, for me as well,and suddenly there are pilesand piles of food on our table,also lots and lots of bottles of wine.So we're nearing the endof our conversationand the end of dinner, and I've decidedSteve the I.T. guy and I are reallyjust not meant for each other,but we'll part ways as friends,when he gets up to go to the bathroom,and in the meantime,the bill comes to our table.And listen, I'm a modern woman.I am totally down with splitting the bill.But then Steve the I.T. guydidn't come back.(Gasping)And that was my entire month's rent.(Audience gasps)So needless to say,I was not having a good night.So I run home, I callmy mother, I call my sister,and as I do, at the end of each oneof these terrible, terrible dates,I regale them with the details.And they say to me,\"Stop complaining.\"(Laughter)\"You're just being too picky.\"So I said, fine, from here on outI'm only going on dateswhere I know there's Wi-Fi,and I'm bringing my laptop.I'm going to shove it into my bag,I'm going to have this email template,and I'm going to fill it outand collect informationon all these differentdata points during the dateto prove to everybody that empirically,these dates really are terrible.(Laughter)So I started tracking things likereally stupid, awkward, sexual remarks;bad vocabulary;the number of times a manforced me to high-five him.(Laughter)So I started to crunch some numbers,and that allowed meto make some correlations.So as it turns out,for some reason, men who drink Scotchreference kinky sex immediately.(Laughter)Well, it turns outthat these probably weren't bad guys.There were just bad for me.And as it happens, the algorithmsthat were setting us up,they weren't bad either.These algorithms were doing exactlywhat they were designed to do,which was to takeour user-generated information,in my case, my r\u00e9sum\u00e9,and match it upwith other people's information.See, the real problem here is that,while the algorithms work just fine,you and I don't,when confronted with blank windowswhere we're supposed to inputour information online.Very few of us have the abilityto be totally and brutallyhonest with ourselves.The other problemis that these websites are asking usquestions like, are youa dog person or a cat person?Do you like horror films or romance films?I'm not looking for a pen pal.I'm looking for a husband. Right?So there's a certain amountof superficiality in that data.So I said fine, I've got a new plan.I'm going to keep usingthese online dating sites,but I'm going to treat them as databases,and rather than waitingfor an algorithm to set me up,I think I'm going to tryreverse-engineering this entire system.So knowing that there was superficial datathat was being usedto match me up with other people,I decided instead to ask my own questions.What was every single possible thingthat I could think ofthat I was looking for in a mate?So I started writingand writing and writing,and at the end, I had amassed72 different data points.I wanted somebody was Jew-ish,so I was looking for somebodywho had the same backgroundand thoughts on our culture,but wasn't going to force me to go to shulevery Friday and Saturday.I wanted somebody who worked hard,because work for meis extremely important,but not too hard.For me, the hobbies that I haveare really just new work projectsthat I've launched.I also wanted somebodywho not only wanted two children,but was going to have the sameattitude toward parenting that I do,so somebody who was goingto be totally okaywith forcing our child to starttaking piano lessons at age three,and also maybe computer science classesif we could wrangle it.So things like that,but I also wanted somebodywho would go to far-flung,exotic places, like Petra, Jordan.I also wanted somebody who would weigh20 pounds more than me at all times,regardless of what I weighed.(Laughter)So I now havethese 72 different data points,which, to be fair, is a lot.So what I did was, I went throughand I prioritized that list.I broke it into a top tierand a second tier of points,and I ranked everything starting at 100and going all the way down to 91,and listing things like I was lookingfor somebody who was really smart,who would challenge and stimulate me,and balancing that with a second tierand a second set of points.These things were also important to mebut not necessarily deal-breakers.(Laughter)So once I had all this done,I then built a scoring system,because what I wanted to dowas to sort of mathematically calculatewhether or not I thoughtthe guy that I found onlinewould be a match with me.I figured there would bea minimum of 700 pointsbefore I would agree to email somebodyor respond to an email message.For 900 points,I'd agree to go out on a date,and I wouldn't even considerany kind of relationshipbefore somebody had crossedthe 1,500 point threshold.Well, as it turns out,this worked pretty well.So I go back online now.I found Jewishdoc57who's incredibly good-looking,incredibly well-spoken,he had hiked Mt. Fuji,he had walked along the Great Wall.He likes to travelas long as it doesn't involvea cruise ship.And I thought,I've done it!I've cracked the code.I have just foundthe Jewish Prince Charmingof my family's dreams.There was only one problem:He didn't like me back.And I guess the one variablethat I haven't consideredis the competition.Who are all of the other womenon these dating sites?I found SmileyGirl1978.She said she was a \"Fun girlwho is Happy and Outgoing.\"She listed her job as \"teacher.\"She said she is\"silly, nice and friendly.\"She likes to make people laugh \"alot.\"At this moment I knew,clicking profile after profilethat looked like this,that I needed to do some market research.So I created 10 fake male profiles.Now, before I lose all of you --(Laughter) --understand that I did thisstrictly to gather dataabout everybody else in the system.I didn't carry on crazy Catfish-stylerelationships with anybody.I really was just scraping their data.But I didn't want everybody's data.I only wanted data on the womenwho were going to be attractedto the type of man that I really,really wanted to marry.When I released these men into the wild,I did follow some rules.So I didn't reach out to any woman first.I just waited to seewho these profiles were going to attract,and mainly what I was looking atwas two different data sets.So I was looking at qualitative data,so what was the humor, the tone,the voice, the communication stylethat these women shared in common?And also quantitative data,so what was the average lengthof their profile,how much time was spent between messages?What I was trying to get at here wasthat I figured, in person,I would be just as competitiveas a SmileyGirl1978.I wanted to figure out how to maximizemy own profile online.Well, one month later,I had a lot of data,and I was able to do another analysis.And as it turns out,content matters a lot.So smart people tend to write a lot --3,000, 4,000, 5,000 wordsabout themselves,which may all be very, very interesting.The challenge here, though,is that the popular men and womenare sticking to 97 words on averagethat are written very, very well,even though it may not seemlike it all the time.The other hallmarkof the people who do this wellis that they're usingnon-specific language.So in my case,\"The English Patient\"is my most favorite movie ever,but it doesn't workto use that in a profile,because that's a superficial data point,and somebody may disagreeand decide they don't want to go outbecause they didn't likesitting through the three-hour movie.Also, optimistic language matters a lot.So this is a word cloudhighlighting the most popularwords that were usedby the most popular women,words like \"fun\" and \"girl\" and \"love.\"And what I realized was notthat I had to dumb down my own profile.Remember, I'm somebody who saidthat I speak fluent Japaneseand I know JavaScriptand I was okay with that.The difference is that it's about beingmore approachableand helping people understandthe best way to reach out to you.And as it turns out, timingis also really, really important.Just because you have accessto somebody's mobile phone numberor their instant message accountand it's 2 o'clock in the morningand you happen to be awake,doesn't mean that that's a good timeto communicate with those people.The popular women on these online sitesspend an average of 23 hoursin between each communication.And that's what we would normally doin the usual process of courtship.And finally --there were the photos.All of the women who were popularshowed some skin.They all looked really great,which turned out to be in sharp contrastto what I had uploaded.(Laughter)Once I had all of this information,I was able to create a super profile,so it was still me,but it was me optimized nowfor this ecosystem.And as it turns out,I did a really good job.I was the most popular person online.(Laughter)(Applause)And as it turns out, lots and lotsof men wanted to date me.So I call my mom, I call my sister,I call my grandmother.I'm telling them about this fabulous news,and they say, \"This is wonderful!How soon are you going out?\"I said, \"Actually, I'm not goingto go out with anybody.\"Because remember, in my scoring system,they have to reach a minimumthreshold of 700 points,and none of them have done that.They said, \"What?You're still being too damn picky.\"Well, not too long after that,I found this guy, Thevenin,and he said that he was culturally Jewish,he said that his jobwas an arctic baby seal hunter,which I thought was very clever.He talked in detail about travel.He made a lot of reallyinteresting cultural references.He looked and talked exactlylike what I wanted,and immediately, he scored 850 points.It was enough for a date.Three weeks later, we met up in personfor what turned out to bea 14-hour-long conversationthat went from coffee shop to restaurantto another coffee shopto another restaurant,and when he dropped me back offat my house that nightI re-scored him --[1,050 points!]Thought, you know what,this entire time,I haven't been picky enough.Well, a year and a half after that,we were non-cruise ship travelingthrough Petra, Jordan,when he got down on his knee and proposed.A year after that, we were married,and about a year and a half after that,our daughter, Petra, was born.Audience: Oh!(Applause)[What it means...]Obviously, I'm havinga fabulous life, so --(Laughter)The question is, what doesall of this mean for you?Well, as it turns out,there is an algorithm for love.It's just not the onesthat we're being presented with online.In fact, it's somethingthat you write yourself.So whether you're lookingfor a husband or a wifeor you're trying to find your passionor you're trying to start a business,all you have to really dois figure out your own frameworkand play by your own rules,and feel free to be as picky as you want.Well, on my wedding day,I had a conversation againwith my grandmother,and she said, \"All right,maybe I was wrong.It looks like you did come upwith a really, really great system.Now, your matzah balls ...They should be fluffy, not hard.\"(Laughter)And I'll take her advice on that.(Applause)",

   "title": "The unheard story of David and Goliath | Malcolm Gladwell",
   "publishedAt": "30 Sep 2013",
   "transcription": "So I wanted to tell a storythat really obsessed me when I was writing my new book,and it's a story of something that happened3,000 years ago,when the Kingdom of Israel was in its infancy.And it takes place in an area called the Shephelahin what is now Israel.And the reason the story obsessed me is thatI thought I understood it, and then I went back over itand I realized that I didn't understand it at all.Ancient Palestine had a -- along its eastern border,there's a mountain range.Still same is true of Israel today.And in the mountain range are all of the ancient citiesof that region, so Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Hebron.And then there's a coastal plainalong the Mediterranean, where Tel Aviv is now.And connecting the mountain range with the coastal plainis an area called the Shephelah,which is a series of valleys and ridges that run east to west,and you can follow the Shephelah, go through the Shephelahto get from the coastal plain to the mountains.And the Shephelah, if you've been to Israel, you'll knowit's just about the most beautiful part of Israel.It's gorgeous, with forests of oakand wheat fields and vineyards.But more importantly, though, in the history of that region,it's served, it's had a real strategic function,and that is, it is the means by which hostile armieson the coastal plain find their way,get up into the mountains and threaten those living in the mountains.And 3,000 years ago, that's exactly what happens.The Philistines, who are the biggest of enemiesof the Kingdom of Israel,are living in the coastal plain.They're originally from Crete. They're a seafaring people.And they may start to make their waythrough one of the valleys of the Shephelahup into the mountains,because what they want to do is occupy the highland arearight by Bethlehem and split the Kingdom of Israel in two.And the Kingdom of Israel, which is headed by King Saul,obviously catches wind of this,and Saul brings his army down from the mountainsand he confronts the Philistines in the Valley of Elah,one of the most beautiful of the valleys of the Shephelah.And the Israelites dig in along the northern ridge,and the Philistines dig in along the southern ridge,and the two armies just sit there for weeksand stare at each other, because they're deadlocked.Neither can attack the other, because to attack the other sideyou've got to come down the mountain into the valleyand then up the other side, and you're completely exposed.So finally, to break the deadlock,the Philistines send their mightiest warriordown into the valley floor, and he calls outand he says to the Israelites,\"Send your mightiest warrior down,and we'll have this out, just the two of us.\"This was a tradition in ancient warfare called single combat.It was a way of settling disputeswithout incurring the bloodshed of a major battle.And the Philistine who is sent down,their mighty warrior, is a giant.He's 6 foot 9.He's outfitted head to toe in this glittering bronze armor,and he's got a sword and he's got a javelinand he's got his spear. He is absolutely terrifying.And he's so terrifying that none of the Israelite soldiers want to fight him.It's a death wish, right? There's no way they think they can take him.And finally the only person who will come forwardis this young shepherd boy,and he goes up to Saul and he says, \"I'll fight him.\"And Saul says, \"You can't fight him. That's ridiculous.You're this kid. This is this mighty warrior.\"But the shepherd is adamant. He says, \"No, no, no,you don't understand, I have been defending my flockagainst lions and wolves for years. I think I can do it.\"And Saul has no choice. He's got no one else who's come forward.So he says, \"All right.\"And then he turns to the kid, and he says,\"But you've got to wear this armor. You can't go as you are.\"So he tries to give the shepherd his armor,and the shepherd says, \"No.\"He says, \"I can't wear this stuff.\"The Biblical verse is, \"I cannot wear this for I have not proved it,\"meaning, \"I've never worn armor before. You've got to be crazy.\"So he reaches down instead on the groundand picks up five stonesand puts them in his shepherd's bagand starts to walk down the mountainside to meet the giant.And the giant sees this figure approaching,and calls out, \"Come to me so I can feed your fleshto the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field.\"He issues this kind of taunt towards this personcoming to fight him.And the shepherd draws closer and closer,and the giant sees that he's carrying a staff.That's all he's carrying.Instead of a weapon, just this shepherd's staff,and he says -- he's insulted --\"Am I a dog that you would come to me with sticks?\"And the shepherd boy takes one of his stonesout of his pocket, puts it in his slingand rolls it around and lets it flyand it hits the giant right between the eyes --right here, in his most vulnerable spot --and he falls down either dead or unconscious,and the shepherd boy runs up and takes his swordand cuts off his head,and the Philistines see this and they turn and they just run.And of course, the name of the giant is Goliathand the name of the shepherd boy is David,and the reason that story has obsessed meover the course of writing my bookis that everything I thought I knew about that storyturned out to be wrong.So David, in that story, is supposed to be the underdog, right?In fact, that term, David and Goliath,has entered our language as a metaphor forimprobable victoriesby some weak party over someone far stronger.Now why do we call David an underdog?Well, we call him an underdog because he's a kid,a little kid, and Goliath is this big, strong giant.We also call him an underdogbecause Goliath is an experienced warrior,and David is just a shepherd.But most importantly, we call him an underdogbecause all he has is -- it's that Goliath is outfitted withall of this modern weaponry,this glittering coat of armorand a sword and a javelin and a spear,and all David has is this sling.Well, let's start there with the phrase\"All David has is this sling,\"because that's the first mistake that we make.In ancient warfare, there are three kinds of warriors.There's cavalry, men on horseback and with chariots.There's heavy infantry, which are foot soldiers,armed foot soldiers with swords and shieldsand some kind of armor.And there's artillery, and artillery are archers,but, more importantly, slingers.And a slinger is someone who has a leather pouchwith two long cords attached to it,and they put a projectile, either a rock or a lead ball,inside the pouch, and they whirl it around like thisand they let one of the cords go,and the effect is to send the projectile forwardtowards its target.That's what David has, and it's important to understandthat that sling is not a slingshot.It's not this, right? It's not a child's toy.It's in fact an incredibly devastating weapon.When David rolls it around like this,he's turning the sling around probablyat six or seven revolutions per second,and that means that when the rock is released,it's going forward really fast,probably 35 meters per second.That's substantially faster than a baseballthrown by even the finest of baseball pitchers.More than that, the stones in the Valley of Elahwere not normal rocks. They were barium sulphate,which are rocks twice the density of normal stones.If you do the calculations on the ballistics,on the stopping power of the rock fired from David's sling,it's roughly equal to the stopping powerof a [.45 caliber] handgun.This is an incredibly devastating weapon.Accuracy, we know from historical recordsthat slingers -- experienced slingers could hitand maim or even kill a target at distances of up to 200 yards.From medieval tapestries, we know that slingerswere capable of hitting birds in flight.They were incredibly accurate.When David lines up -- and he's not 200 yards away from Goliath,he's quite close to Goliath --when he lines up and fires that thing at Goliath,he has every intention and every expectationof being able to hit Goliath at his most vulnerable spotbetween his eyes.If you go back over the history of ancient warfare,you will find time and time againthat slingers were the decisive factor against infantryin one kind of battle or another.So what's Goliath? He's heavy infantry,and his expectation when he challenges the Israelites to a duelis that he's going to be fighting another heavy infantryman.When he says, \"Come to me that I mightfeed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field,\"the key phrase is \"Come to me.\"Come up to me because we're going to fight,hand to hand, like this.Saul has the same expectation.David says, \"I want to fight Goliath,\"and Saul tries to give him his armor,because Saul is thinking, \"Oh, when you say 'fight Goliath,'you mean 'fight him in hand-to-hand combat,'infantry on infantry.\"But David has absolutely no expectation.He's not going to fight him that way. Why would he?He's a shepherd. He's spent his entire careerusing a sling to defend his flock against lions and wolves.That's where his strength lies.So here he is, this shepherd, experiencedin the use of a devastating weapon,up against this lumbering giantweighed down by a hundred pounds of armorand these incredibly heavy weaponsthat are useful only in short-range combat.Goliath is a sitting duck. He doesn't have a chance.So why do we keep calling David an underdog,and why do we keep referring to his victory as improbable?There's a second piece of this that's important.It's not just that we misunderstand Davidand his choice of weaponry.It's also that we profoundly misunderstand Goliath.Goliath is not what he seems to be.There's all kinds of hints of this in the Biblical text,things that are in retrospect quite puzzlingand don't square with his image as this mighty warrior.So to begin with, the Bible says that Goliathis led onto the valley floor by an attendant.Now that is weird, right?Here is this mighty warriorchallenging the Israelites to one-on-one combat.Why is he being led by the handby some young boy, presumably,to the point of combat?Secondly, the Bible story makes special noteof how slowly Goliath moves,another odd thing to say when you're describingthe mightiest warrior known to man at that point.And then there's this whole weird thingabout how long it takes Goliath to reactto the sight of David.So David's coming down the mountain,and he's clearly not preparing for hand-to-hand combat.There is nothing about him that says,\"I am about to fight you like this.\"He's not even carrying a sword.Why does Goliath not react to that?It's as if he's oblivious to what's going on that day.And then there's that strange comment he makes to David:\"Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks?\"Sticks? David only has one stick.Well, it turns out that there's been a great dealof speculation within the medical community over the yearsabout whether there is somethingfundamentally wrong with Goliath,an attempt to make sense of all of those apparent anomalies.There have been many articles written.The first one was in 1960 in the Indiana Medical Journal,and it started a chain of speculationthat starts with an explanation for Goliath's height.So Goliath is head and shoulders aboveall of his peers in that era,and usually when someone is that far out of the norm,there's an explanation for it.So the most common form of giantismis a condition called acromegaly,and acromegaly is caused by a benign tumoron your pituitary glandthat causes an overproduction of human growth hormone.And throughout history, many of the most famous giantshave all had acromegaly.So the tallest person of all timewas a guy named Robert Wadlowwho was still growing when he died at the age of 24and he was 8 foot 11.He had acromegaly.Do you remember the wrestler Andr\u00e9 the Giant?Famous. He had acromegaly.There's even speculation that Abraham Lincoln had acromegaly.Anyone who's unusually tall,that's the first explanation we come up with.And acromegaly has a very distinct set of side effectsassociated with it,principally having to do with vision.The pituitary tumor, as it grows,often starts to compress the visual nerves in your brain,with the result that people with acromegalyhave either double vision or they are profoundly nearsighted.So when people have started to speculateabout what might have been wrong with Goliath,they've said, \"Wait a minute,he looks and sounds an awful lot like someonewho has acromegaly.\"And that would also explain so much of what was strangeabout his behavior that day.Why does he move so slowlyand have to be escorted down into the valley floorby an attendant?Because he can't make his way on his own.Why is he so strangely oblivious to Davidthat he doesn't understand that David's not going to fight himuntil the very last moment?Because he can't see him.When he says, \"Come to me that I might feed your fleshto the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field,\"the phrase \"come to me\" is a hint also of his vulnerability.Come to me because I can't see you.And then there's, \"Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks?\"He sees two sticks when David has only one.So the Israelites up on the mountain ridgelooking down on him thought he wasthis extraordinarily powerful foe.What they didn't understand was thatthe very thing that was the source of his apparent strengthwas also the source of his greatest weakness.And there is, I think, in that,a very important lesson for all of us.Giants are not as strong and powerful as they seem.And sometimes the shepherd boy has a sling in his pocket.Thank you.(Applause)",

an obvious answer we're aloneit's just us there could be a trillionplanets in the galaxy is it plausiblewe're the only creatures capable ofcontemplating this question well yesbecause in this context we don't knowwhether a trillion is a big number in2000 Peter Ward and Don Brownleeproposed the rare earth idea rememberthose four barriers that people use toestimate the number of civilizationsWadden grandly said there might be morelet's look at one possible barrier it'sa recent suggest you that David Walton ageophysicist this is my very simplifiedversion of Dave's much moresophisticated argument we are able to behere now because Earth's previousinhabitants enjoyed 4 billion years ofgood weather obviously downs but more orless climate but long-term climatestability is strange if only becauseastronomical influences can push aplanet towards freezing or fryingthere's a hint our moon has helped andthat's interesting because theprevailing theory is that the moon cameinto being and f\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1 a body the size ofMars crashed into a newly formed earththe outcome of that crash could havebeen a quite different Earth Moon systemwe ended up with a large moonand that permitted earth to have both astable axial tilt and a slow rotationrate both factors influence climate andthe suggestion is that they've helpedmoderate climate change great fellersright but one of them showed that if themoon were just a few miles bigger thingswould be differentEarth's spin axis would now wanderchaotically they'd be episodes of rapidclimate change not good for complex lifethe moon is just the right size big butnot too big a Goldilocks moon around aGoldilocks planet the barrier perhapsyou can imagine more barriers forinstance simple cells came into beingmillions of years ago but perhaps thedevelopment of complex life needed aseries of unlikely events once life onearth had access to multicellularity andsophisticated genetic structures and sexnew opportunities opened up animalsbecame possible but maybe it's the fateof many planets for life to settle atthe level of simple cells purely for thepurposes of illustration let me suggestfour more barriers to add to the for thepeople said blocks the path tocommunicative civilization again purelyfor the purposes of illustrationsupposes a one in a thousand chance ofmaking it across each of the barriers ofcourse there might be different ways ofnavigating the barriers and some chanceswill be better than one in a thousandequally there might be more barriers andsome chances might be one in a millionlet's just see what

   "title": "The bridge between suicide and life | Kevin Briggs",
   "publishedAt": "14 May 2014",
   "transcription": "I recently retiredfrom the California Highway Patrolafter 23 years of service.The majority of those 23 yearswas spent patrolling the southern endof Marin County,which includes the Golden Gate Bridge.The bridge is an iconic structure,known worldwidefor its beautiful views of San Francisco,the Pacific Ocean, and its inspiring architecture.Unfortunately, it is also a magnet for suicide,being one of the most utilized sites in the world.The Golden Gate Bridge opened in 1937.Joseph Strauss, chief engineerin charge of building the bridge,was quoted as saying,\"The bridge is practically suicide-proof.Suicide from the bridgeis neither practical nor probable.\"But since its opening,over 1,600 people have leapt to their deathfrom that bridge.Some believe that travelingbetween the two towerswill lead you to another dimension --this bridge has been romanticized as such \u2014that the fall from thatfrees you from all your worries and grief,and the waters belowwill cleanse your soul.But let me tell you what actually occurswhen the bridge is usedas a means of suicide.After a free fall of four to five seconds,the body strikes the waterat about 75 miles an hour.That impact shatters bones,some of which then puncture vital organs.Most die on impact.Those that don'tgenerally flail in the water helplessly,and then drown.I don't think that those who contemplatethis method of suiciderealize how grisly a death that they will face.This is the cord.Except for around the two towers,there is 32 inches of steelparalleling the bridge.This is where most folks standbefore taking their lives.I can tell you from experiencethat once the person is on that cord,and at their darkest time,it is very difficult to bring them back.I took this photo last yearas this young woman spoke to an officercontemplating her life.I want to tell you very happilythat we were successful that dayin getting her back over the rail.When I first began working on the bridge,we had no formal training.You struggled to funnel yourway through these calls.This was not only a disserviceto those contemplating suicide,but to the officers as well.We've come a long, long way since then.Now, veteran officers and psychologiststrain new officers.This is Jason Garber.I met Jason on July 22 of last yearwhen I get received a callof a possible suicidal subjectsitting on the cord near midspan.I responded, and when I arrived,I observed Jasonspeaking to a Golden Gate Bridge officer.Jason was just 32 years oldand had flown out here from New Jersey.As a matter of fact,he had flown out here on two other occasionsfrom New Jerseyto attempt suicide on this bridge.After about an hour of speaking with Jason,he asked us if we knew the story of Pandora's box.Recalling your Greek mythology,Zeus created Pandora,and sent her down to Earth with a box,and told her, \"Never, ever open that box.\"Well one day, curiosity got the better of Pandora,and she did open the box.Out flew plagues, sorrows,and all sorts of evils against man.The only good thing in the box was hope.Jason then asked us,\"What happens when you open the boxand hope isn't there?\"He paused a few moments,leaned to his right,and was gone.This kind, intelligent young man from New Jerseyhad just committed suicide.I spoke with Jason's parents that evening,and I suppose that, when I was speaking with them,that I didn't sound as if I was doing very well,because that very next day,their family rabbi called to check on me.Jason's parents had asked him to do so.The collateral damage of suicideaffects so many people.I pose these questions to you:What would you do if your family member,friend or loved one was suicidal?What would you say?Would you know what to say?In my experience, it's not just the talking that you do,but the listening.Listen to understand.Don't argue, blame,or tell the person you know how they feel,because you probably don't.By just being there,you may just be the turning point that they need.If you think someone is suicidal,don't be afraid to confrontthem and ask the question.One way of asking them the question is like this:\"Others in similar circumstanceshave thought about ending their life;have you had these thoughts?\"Confronting the person head-onmay just save their life andbe the turning point for them.Some other signs to look for:hopelessness, believing that things are terribleand never going to get better;helplessness, believing that there is nothingthat you can do about it;recent social withdrawal;and a loss of interest in life.I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago,and I received an email from a ladythat I'd like to read you her letter.She lost her son on January 19 of this year,and she wrote this me this emailjust a couple of days ago,and it's with her permission and blessingthat I read this to you.\"Hi, Kevin. I imagine you're at the TED Conference.That must be quite the experience to be there.I'm thinking I should go walkthe bridge this weekend.Just wanted to drop you a note.Hope you get the word out to many peopleand they go home talking about itto their friends who tell their friends, etc.I'm still pretty numb,but noticing more moments of really realizingMike isn't coming home.Mike was driving from Petaluma to San Franciscoto watch the 49ers game with his fatheron January 19.He never made it there.I called Petaluma policeand reported him missing that evening.The next morning,two officers came to my homeand reported that Mike's car was down at the bridge.A witness had observed him jumping off the bridgeat 1:58 p.m. the previous day.Thanks so muchfor standing up for thosewho may be only temporarily too weakto stand for themselves.Who hasn't been low beforewithout suffering from a true mental illness?It shouldn't be so easy to end it.My prayers are with you for your fight.The GGB, Golden Gate Bridge,is supposed to be a passage acrossour beautiful bay,not a graveyard.Good luck this week. Vicky.\"I can't imagine the courage it takes for herto go down to that bridge and walk the paththat her son took that day,and also the courage just to carry on.I'd like to introduce you to a manI refer to as hope and courage.On March 11 of 2005,I responded to a radio call of a possiblesuicidal subject on the bridge sidewalknear the north tower.I rode my motorcycle down the sidewalkand observed this man, Kevin Berthia,standing on the sidewalk.When he saw me, he immediately traversedthat pedestrian rail,and stood on that small pipewhich goes around the tower.For the next hour and a half,I listened as Kevin spoke abouthis depression and hopelessness.Kevin decided on his own that dayto come back over that railand give life another chance.When Kevin came back over,I congratulated him.\"This is a new beginning, a new life.\"But I asked him, \"What was itthat made you come backand give hope and life another chance?\"And you know what he told me?He said, \"You listened.You let me speak, and you just listened.\"Shortly after this incident,I received a letter from Kevin's mother,and I have that letter with me,and I'd like to read it to you.\"Dear Mr. Briggs,Nothing will erase the events of March 11,but you are one of the reasons Kevin is still with us.I truly believe Kevin was crying out for help.He has been diagnosed with a mental illnessfor which he has been properly medicated.I adopted Kevin when he was only six months old,completely unaware of any hereditary traits,but, thank God, now we know.Kevin is straight, as he says.We truly thank God for you.Sincerely indebted to you,Narvella Berthia.\"And on the bottom she writes,\"P.S. When I visited San FranciscoGeneral Hospital that evening,you were listed as the patient.Boy, did I have to straighten that one out.\"Today, Kevin is a loving fatherand contributing member of society.He speaks openlyabout the events that day and his depressionin the hopes that his storywill inspire others.Suicide is not just somethingI've encountered on the job.It's personal.My grandfather committed suicide by poisoning.That act, although ending his own pain,robbed me from ever getting to know him.This is what suicide does.For most suicidal folks,or those contemplating suicide,they wouldn't think of hurting another person.They just want their own pain to end.Typically, this is accomplished in just three ways:sleep, drugs or alcohol, or death.In my career, I've responded toand been involved in hundredsof mental illness and suicide callsaround the bridge.Of those incidents I've been directly involved with,I've only lost two,but that's two too many.One was Jason.The other was a man I spoke tofor about an hour.During that time, he shook my handon three occasions.On that final handshake,he looked at me, and he said,\"Kevin, I'm sorry, but I have to go.\"And he leapt.Horrible, absolutely horrible.I do want to tell you, though,the vast majority of folksthat we do get to contact on that bridgedo not commit suicide.Additionally, that very fewwho have jumped off the bridge and livedand can talk about it,that one to two percent,most of those folks have saidthat the second that they let go of that rail,they knew that they had made a mistakeand they wanted to live.I tell people, the bridge not only connectsMarin to San Francisco,but people together also.That connection, or bridge that we make,is something that each and every one of usshould strive to do.Suicide is preventable.There is help. There is hope.Thank you very much.(Applause)",

   "title": "How the blockchain is changing money and business | Don Tapscott",
   "publishedAt": "16 Sep 2016",
   "transcription": "the technology likely to have thegreatest impact on the next few decadeshas arrived and it's not social mediait's not big data it's not roboticsit's not even AI and you'll be surprisedto learn that it's the underlyingtechnology of digital currencies likeBitcoin it's called the blockchain blockchain now it's not the most sonorousword in the world but I believe thatthis is now the next generation of theInternet and that it holds vast promisefor every business every society and forall of you individually you know for thepast few decades we've had the Internetof information and when I send you anemail or a PowerPoint file or somethingI'm actually not sending you theoriginal I'm sending you a copy andthat's greatthis is democratized information butwhen it comes to assets things likemoney financial assets like stocks andbonds loyalty points intellectualproperty music art of vote carbon creditand other assets sending you a copy is areally bad ideaif I send you a hundred dollars it'sreally important that I don't still havemoney and that I can't send it to you sothis has been called the double spamproblem by cryptographers for a longtime so today we rely entirely on bigintermediaries middlemen like banksgovernment big social media companiescredit card companies and so on toestablish trust in our economy and theseintermediaries perform all the businessand transaction logic of every kind ofcommerce from authenticationidentification of people through toclearing settling and record-keepingand overall they do a pretty good jobbut there are growing problems to beginthere centralize that means that theycan be hacked and increasingly are andJP Morgan US federal government LinkedInHome Depot and others found that out thehard way they exclude billions of peoplefrom the global economy for examplepeople who don't have enough money tohave a bank account they slow thingsdowncan take a second for an email to goaround the world but it can take days orweeks for money to move through thebanking system across the city and theytake a big piece of the action10 to 20 percent just to send money toanother country they capture our dataand that means that we can't monetize itor use it to better manage our lives andour privacy is being undermined and thebiggest problem is that overall they'veappropriated the largesse of the digitalage a symmetrically and we have wealthcreation but we have growing socialinequality so what if there were notonly an Internet of information what ifthere were an Internet of value somekind of vast global distributed ledgerrunning on millions of computers andavailable to everybody and where everykind of asset from money to music couldbe stored move transacted exchange andmanaged all without powerfulintermediaries what if there were anative medium for valuewell 2008 the financial industry crashedand perhaps propitiously a unknownanonymous person or persons namedSatoshi Nakamoto created a paper wherehe developed a protocol for a digitalcache that used an underlying cryptocurrency called Bitcoin and thiscryptocurrency enables people toestablish trust and do transactionswithout a third partyand the seemingly simple act set off asparkthat's ignited the world that haseveryone excited or terrified orotherwise interested many places nowdon't be confused about Bitcoin okaybitcoin is an asset it goes up and downand that should be of interest to you ifyou're a speculator more broadly it's acryptocurrency it's not a fiat currencycontrolled by a nation-state and that'sof greater interest but the real ponyhere is the underlying technology it'scalled blockchain so for the first timenow in human history people everywherecan trust each other in transactpeer-to-peer and Trust is establishednot by some big institution but bycollaboration by cryptography and bysome clever code and because Trust isnative to the technology I call this thetrust protocol now you're probablywondering well how does this thing workfair enough assets digital assets likemoney to music and everything in betweenare not stored in a central place butthey're distributed across a globalledger using the highest level ofcryptography and when a transaction isconducted it's posted globally acrossmillions and millions of computers andout there around the world is a group ofpeople called miners these are not youngpeople they're Bitcoin miners and theyhave massive computing power at theirfingertips ten to a hundred times biggerthan all of Google worldwide and theseminers do a lot of work and every tenminutes kind of like the heartbeat of anetwork a block gets created that hasall the transactions from the previousten minutes and then the miners get toworktrying to solve some tough problems andthey compete and the first miner to findout the truth and to validate the blockis rewarded in digital currency in thecase of the Bitcoin blockchain withBitcoinand then this is the key part that blockis linked to the previous block in theprevious block to create a chain ofblocks and everyone is timestamp kind oflike with a digital wax seal so if Iwanted to go in and hack a block and saypay you and you with the same money I'dhave to hack that block plus all thepreceding blocks the entire history ofcommerce on that blockchain not just onone computer but across millions ofcomputers simultaneously all using thehighest levels of encryption in thelight of the most powerful computingresources in the world that's watchingme tough to do and this is infinitelymore secure than the computer systemsthat we have today bought Jane that'show it worksso the Bitcoin blockchain is just onethere are many the etherion blockchainwas developed by a Canadian namedmetallic boot Aaron he's 19 years oldand in this blockchain has someextraordinary capabilities one of themis that you can build smart contractsit's kind of what it sounds like it's acontract that self executes and thecontract handles the enforcement and themanagement performance and payment thecontract kind of has a bank account toin a sense of agreements between peopleand today on the etherium blockchainthere are projects underway to doeverything from create a new replacementfor the stock market to create a newmodel of democracy where wherepoliticians are accountable to citizensso to understand what a radical changethis is going to bring let's look at oneindustry financial services recognizethis Rube Goldberg machine it'sridiculously complicated machine thatdoes something really simple like crackan egg or shut a door well kind ofreminds me of the financial servicesindustry honestly I mean you tap yourcard in the corner store and a bitstream goes through a dozen companiesand each with their own computer systemsome of the being 1970s mainframes olderthan many of the people in this room andthree days later a settlement occurswell with a blockchain financialindustry there would be no settlementbecause the payment and the settlementis the same activity it's just a changein the ledger so Wall Street and allaround the world the financial industryis in a big people about this wonderingcan we be replaced or how do we embracethis technology for success now whyshould you care well let me describesome applications prosperity the firstera of the internet the internet ofinformation brought us wealth but notshared prosperity because socialinequality is growing and this is at theheart of all of the anger and extremismand protectionism and xenophobia andworse that we're seeing growing in theworld today brexit being the most recentcase so could we develop some newapproaches to this problem of inequalitybecause the only approach today is toredistribute wealth tax people andspread around more could we predistribute wealth could we change theway that wealth gets created in thefirst place by democratizing wealthcreation engaging more people in theeconomy and in ensuring that they gotfair compensation let me describe fiveways so this can be done number one didyou know that 70 percent of the peoplein the world who have land have atenuous title to it so you get a littlefarm and Honduras some dictator comes topower he says I know you've got a pieceof paper that says you're on your farmbut the government computer says myfriend owned your farm this happened ona mass scale in Honduras and thisproblem that exists everywhere Hernandode Soto the great Latin Americaneconomist says this is the number oneissue in the world in terms of economicmobility more important than havingbank account because if you don't have avalid title to your land you can borrowagainst it and you can't plan for thefutureso today companies are working withgovernments to put land titles on ablockchain and once it's therethis is immutable you can't hack it thiscreates the conditions for prosperityfor potentially billions of peoplesecondly a lot of writers talk aboutuber and Airbnb and TaskRabbit and lyftand so on as part of the sharing economythis is a very powerful idea that peerscan come together and create and sharewealth my view is that these companiesare not really sharing in fact they'resuccessful precisely because they don'tshare they aggregate services togetherand they sell that what if rather thanAirbnb being a twenty five billiondollar corporation there was adistributed application on a blockchainwe'll call it be Airbnb and it wasessentially owned by all of the peoplewho have a room to rentand when someone wants to rent a roomthey go on to the blockchain databaseand all the criteria sift through helpthem find the right room and then theblockchain helps with the contracting itidentifies the party it handles thepayments just through digital paymentsare built into the system and it evenhandles reputation because if she ratesof room as a 5-star room that room isthere and it's rated and it's immutableso the big sharing economy disruptors inSilicon Valley could be disrupted andthis would be good for prosperity numberthree the biggest flow of funds from thedeveloped world to the developing worldis not corporate investment and it's noteven foreign aid its remittances this isthe global diaspora people have lefttheir ancestral lands and they're givingsending money back to their families athome this is six hundred billion dollarsa year and it'sgrowing and these people getting rippedoff annalee Domingo is a housekeeper andshe lives in Toronto and every month shegoes to the western union office withsome cash to send her remittances to hermom and Manila it costs her around 10percent the money takes four to sevendays to get there mom never knows whenit's going to arrive takes five hoursout of her week to do this six monthsago Annalee Domingo used a blockchainapplication called Abra and from hermobile device she said 300 bucksmy directly to her mom's mobile devicewithout going through an intermediaryand then her mom looked at her mobiledevice it's kind of like an uberinterfaces Abra tellers moving aroundshe clicks on a teller that's a 5-starteller in seven minutes away guy showsup at the door gives her a Filipino pesoshe put some in her wallet the wholething took minutes and it cost you 2%this is a big opportunity for prosperitynumber four the most powerful asset ofthe digital age is data and data isreally a new asset class maybe biggerthan previous asset classes like landunder the agrarian economy or inindustrial plant or even money and allof you we create this data we createthis asset and we leave this trail ofdigital crumbs behind us as we gothroughout life and these crumbs arecollected into a mirror image of you thevirtual you and the virtual you may knowmore about you than you do because youcan't remember what you bought a yearago or said a year ago or your exactlocation a year ago and the virtual youis not owned by you that's the bigproblem so today there are companiesworking to create a identity in a blackbox the virtual you owned by you andthis black box moves around with you asyou travel throughout the world and it'svery very stingy it only gives away theshred of information that's required todo something a lot of transactions theseller doesn't even need to knowwho you are they just need to know thatthey got paid and then this avatarsweeping up all this data and enablingyou to monetize it and this is awonderful thing because it can also helpus protect our privacy and privacy isthe foundation of a free society let'sget this asset that we create back underour control where we can own our ownidentity and manage it responsiblyfinally finally number five there are awhole number creators of content whodon't receive fair compensation becausethe system for intellectual property isbroken it was broken by the first era ofthe internet take music musicians areleft with crumbs at the end of the wholefood chain you know if you're asongwriter twenty-five years ago youwrote up a hit song it got a millionsingles you could get royalties around$45,000 today you're a songwriter youwrite a hit song it gets a millionscreams you don't get 45 K you get $36enough to buy a nice pizza so imagineheat the Grammy winning singersongwriter is now putting music on ablockchain ecosystem she calls itmycelium and the music has a smartcontract surrounding it and the musicprotects her intellectual propertyrights you want to listen to the songit's free or maybe it's a few microcents flow into a digital account youwant to put the song in your moviethat's different and the IP rights areall specified you want to make aringtone that's different she describesthat the song becomes a business it'sout there on this platform marketingitself protecting the rights of theauthor and because the song is a paymentsystem in a sense of bank account allmoney flows back to the artist and theycontrol the industry rather than thesepowerful intermediaries now this isthis is not just songwriters it's anycreator of content like art likeinventions scientific discoveriesjournalists there all kinds of peoplewho don't get fair compensation and withblockchainsthey're going to be able to make it rainon the blockchain and that's a wonderfulthing so these are five opportunities ofout of a dozen to solve one problemprosperity which is one of countlessproblems that block chains areapplicable to now technology doesn'tcreate prosperity of course people dobut my case to you is that once againthe technology genie has escaped fromthe bottle and it was summoned by anunknown person or persons at thisuncertain time in human history and it'sgiving us another kick at the cananother opportunity to rewrite theeconomic power grid and the old order ofthings and to solve some of the world'smost difficult problems if we will itthankyou",

   "title": "How sampling transformed music | Mark Ronson",
   "publishedAt": "09 May 2014",
   "transcription": "I'm assuming everyone here has watcheda TED Talk online at one time or another, right?So what I'm going to do is play this.This is the song from the TED Talks online.(Music)And I'm going to slow it downbecause things sound cooler when they're slower.(Music)Ken Robinson: Good morning. How are you?Mark Applebaum: I'm going to --Kate Stone: -- mix some music.MA: I'm going to do so in a way that tells a story.Tod Machover: Something nobody's ever heard before.KS: I have a crossfader.Julian Treasure: I call this the mixer.KS: Two D.J. decks.Chris Anderson: You turn up the dials, the wheel starts to turn.Dan Ellsey: I have always loved music.Michael Tilson Thomas: Is it a melody or a rhythm or a mood or an attitude?Daniel Wolpert: Feeling everything that's going on inside my body.Adam Ockelford: In your brain is this amazing musical computer.MTT: Using computers and synthesizers to create works. It's a language that's still evolving.And the 21st century.KR: Turn on the radio. Pop into the discotheque.You will know what this person is doing: moving to the music.Mark Ronson: This is my favorite part.MA: You gotta have doorstops. That's important.TM: We all love music a great deal.MTT: Anthems, dance crazes, ballads and marches.Kirby Ferguson and JT: The remix: It is new music created from old music.Ryan Holladay: Blend seamlessly.Kathryn Schulz: And that's how it goes.MTT: What happens when the music stops?KS: Yay!(Applause)MR: Obviously, I've been watching a lot of TED Talks.When I was first asked to speak at TED,I wasn't quite sure what my angle was, at first,so yeah, I immediately startedwatching tons of TED Talks,which is pretty much absolutelythe worst thing that you can dobecause you start to go into panic mode, thinking,I haven't mounted a successfulexpedition to the North Pole yet.Neither have I provided electricityto my village through sheer ingenuity.In fact, I've pretty much wasted most of my lifeDJing in night clubsand producing pop records.But I still kept watching the videos,because I'm a masochist,and eventually, things like Michael Tilson Thomasand Tod Machover, and seeingtheir visceral passion talking about music,it definitely stirred something in me,and I'm a sucker for anyone talking devotedlyabout the power of music.And I started to write down on these little note cardsevery time I heard somethingthat struck a chord in me, pardon the pun,or something that I thought I could use,and pretty soon, my studio looked like this,kind of like a John Nash, \"Beautiful Mind\" vibe.The other good thing about watching TED Talks,when you see a really good one,you kind of all of a sudden wish the speakerwas your best friend, don't you? Like, just for a day.They seem like a nice person.You'd take a bike ride, maybe share an ice cream.You'd certainly learn a lot.And every now and then they'd chide you,when they got frustrated that you couldn't reallykeep up with half of the technical thingsthey're banging on about all the time.But then they'd remember thatyou're but a mere humanof ordinary, mortal intelligencethat didn't finish university,and they'd kind of forgive you,and pet you like the dog.(Laughter)Man, yeah, back to the real world,probably Sir Ken Robinson and Iare not going to end up being best of friends.He lives all the way in L.A.and I imagine is quite busy,but through the tools available to me -- technologyand the innate way that I approach making music --I can sort of bully our existencesinto a shared event,which is sort of what you saw.I can hear something that I love in a piece of mediaand I can co-opt itand insert myself in that narrative,or alter it, even.In a nutshell, that's what I was trying to dowith these things, but more importantly,that's what the past 30 years of music has been.That's the major thread.See, 30 years ago, you had the first digital samplers,and they changed everything overnight.All of a sudden, artists could samplefrom anything and everything that came before them,from a snare drum from the Funky Meters,to a Ron Carter bassline,the theme to \"The Price Is Right.\"Albums like De La Soul's \"3 Feet High and Rising\"and the Beastie Boys' \"Paul's Boutique\"looted from decades of recorded musicto create these sonic, layered masterpiecesthat were basically the Sgt. Peppers of their day.And they weren't sampling these recordsbecause they were too lazy to write their own music.They weren't sampling these records to cash in onthe familiarity of the original stuff.To be honest, it was all about samplingreally obscure things,except for a few obvious exceptionslike Vanilla Ice and \"doo doo doo da da doo doo\"that we know about.But the thing is,they were sampling those recordsbecause they heard something in that musicthat spoke to themthat they instantly wanted to inject themselvesinto the narrative of that music.They heard it, they wanted to be a part of it,and all of a sudden they found themselvesin possession of the technology to do so,not much unlike the way the Delta bluesstruck a chord with the Stonesand the Beatles and Clapton,and they felt the need to co-opt that musicfor the tools of their day.You know, in music we take something that we loveand we build on it.I'd like to play a song for you.(Music: \"La Di Da Di\" by Doug E. Fresh & Slick Rick)That's \"La Di Da Di\" and it's the fifth-most sampledsong of all time.It's been sampled 547 times.It was made in 1984 by these two legends of hip-hop,Slick Rick and Doug E. Fresh,and the Ray-Ban and Jheri curl look is so strong.I do hope that comes back soon.Anyway, this predated the sampling era.There were no samples in this record,although I did look up on the Internet last night,I mean several months ago,that \"La Di Da Di\" means, it's an oldCockney expression from the late 1800s in England,so maybe a remix with Mrs. Patmorefrom \"Downton Abbey\" coming soon,or that's for another day.Doug E. Fresh was the human beat box.Slick Rick is the voice you hear on the record,and because of Slick Rick's sing-songy,super-catchy vocals, it provides endless sound bitesand samples for future pop records.That was 1984.This is me in 1984, in case you were wonderinghow I was doing, thank you for asking.It's Throwback Thursday already.I was involved in a heavy love affairwith the music of Duran Duran,as you can probably tell from my outfit.I was in the middle.And the simplest way that I knewhow to co-opt myself into that experienceof wanting to be in that song somehowwas to just get a band togetherof fellow nine-year-oldsand play \"Wild Boys\" at the school talent show.So that's what we did, and long story short,we were booed off the stage,and if you ever have a chance to live your lifeescaping hearing the sound of an auditoriumfull of second- and third-graders booing,I would highly recommend it. It's not really fun.But it didn't really matter,because what I wanted somehowwas to just be in the historyof that song for a minute.I didn't care who liked it.I just loved it, and I thoughtI could put myself in there.Over the next 10 years, \"La Di Da Di\"continues to be sampled by countless records,ending up on massive hits like\"Here Comes the Hotstepper\"and \"I Wanna Sex You Up.\"Snoop Doggy Dogg covers this songon his debut album \"Doggystyle\"and calls it \"Lodi Dodi.\"Copyright lawyers are havinga field day at this point.And then you fast forward to 1997,and the Notorious B.I.G., or Biggie,reinterprets \"La Di Da Di\"on his number one hit called \"Hypnotize,\"which I will play a little bit ofand I will play you a little bit of the Slick Rickto show you where they got it from.(Music: \"Hypnotize\" by The Notorious B.I.G.)So Biggie was killedweeks before that song made it to number one,in one of the great tragedies of the hip-hop era,but he would have been 13 years oldand very much alive when\"La Di Da Di\" first came out,and as a young boygrowing up in Brooklyn,it's hard not to think that that song probably heldsome fond memories for him.But the way he interpreted it, as you hear,is completely his own.He flips it, makes it,there's nothing pastiche whatsoever about it.It's thoroughly modern Biggie.I had to make that joke in this room,because you would be the only peoplethat I'd ever have a chance of getting it.And so, it's a groaner. (Laughter)Elsewhere in the pop and rap world,we're going a little bit sample-crazy.We're getting away from the obscuresamples that we were doing,and all of a sudden everyone's takingthese massive '80s tunes like Bowie, \"Let's Dance,\"and all these disco records,and just rapping on them.These records don't really age that well.You don't hear them now, because they borrowedfrom an era that was too steepedin its own connotation.You can't just hijack nostalgia wholesale.It leaves the listener feeling sickly.You have to take an element of those thingsand then bring something fresh and new to it,which was something that I learnedwhen I was working with the late,amazing Amy Winehouseon her album \"Back to Black.\"A lot of fuss was made about the sonic of the albumthat myself and Salaam Remi, the other producer,achieved, how we captured this long-lost sound,but without the very, very 21st-century personalityand firebrand that was Amy Winehouseand her lyrics about rehab and Roger Mooreand even a mention of Slick Rick,the whole thing would have run the riskof being very pastiche, to be honest.Imagine any other singer from that era over itsinging the same old lyrics.It runs a risk of being completely bland.I mean, there was no doubt that Amyand I and Salaam all had this lovefor this gospel, soul and blues and jazzthat was evident listening tothe musical arrangements.She brought the ingredients that made it urgentand of the time.So if we come all the way up to the present day now,the cultural tour de force that is Miley Cyrus,she reinterprets \"La Di Da Di\"completely for her generation,and we'll take a listen to the Slick Rick partand then see how she sort of flipped it.(Music: \"La Di Da Di\" by Slick Rick & Doug E. Fresh)(Music: \"We Can't Stop\" by Miley Cyrus)So Miley Cyrus,who wasn't even born yetwhen \"La Di Da Di\" was made,and neither were any of the co-writers on the song,has found this song that somehowetched its way into the collectiveconsciousness of pop music,and now, with its timeless playfulness of the original,has kind of translated to a whole new generationwho will probably co-opt it as their own.Since the dawn of the sampling era,there's been endless debateabout the validity of music that contains samples.You know, the Grammy committee says thatif your song contains some kind of pre-writtenor pre-existing music,you're ineligible for song of the year.Rockists, who are racistbut only about rock music,constantly use the argument to \u2014That's a real word. That is a real word.They constantly use the argument to devalue rapand modern pop,and these arguments completely miss the point,because the dam has burst.We live in the post-sampling era.We take the things that we loveand we build on them.That's just how it goes.And when we really addsomething significant and originaland we merge our musical journey with this,then we have a chance to bea part of the evolution of that music that we loveand be linked with it once itbecomes something new again.So I would like to do one more piecethat I put together for you tonight,and it takes place with twopretty inspiring TED performances that I've seen.One of them is the piano player Derek Paravicini,who happens to be a blind,autistic genius at the piano,and Emmanuel Jal, who is an ex-child soldierfrom the South Sudan,who is a spoken word poet and rapper.And once again I found a way to annoyinglyme-me-me myself into the musical historyof these songs,but I can't help it,because they're these things that I love,and I want to mess around with them.So I hope you enjoy this. Here we go.Let's hear that TED sound again, right?(Music)Thank you very much. Thank you.(Applause)",

   "title": "Can we build AI without losing control over it? | Sam Harris",
   "publishedAt": "19 Oct 2016",
   "transcription": "let's talk about a failure of intuitionthat many of us suffer from it's reallya failure to detect a certain kind ofdanger I'm gonna describe a scenariothat I think is both terrifying andlikely to occur and that's not a goodcombination as it turns out and yetrather than be scared most of you willfeel that what I'm talking about is kindof coolI'm gonna describe how the gains we makein artificial intelligence couldultimately destroy us in fact I thinkit's very difficult to see how theywon't destroy us or inspire us todestroy ourselves and yet if you'reanything like me you'll find that it'sfun to think about these things and thatthat response is part of the problemokay that response should worry you if Iwere to convince you in this talk thatwe were likely to suffer a global famineeither because of climate change or someother catastrophe and that yourgrandchildren or their grandchildren arevery likely to live like thisyou wouldn't think interesting I likethis TED talkfamine isn't fun death by sciencefiction on the other hand is fun and oneof the things that worries me most aboutthe development of AI at this point isthat we seem unable to marshal anappropriate emotional response to thedangers that lie ahead I'm unable tomarshal this response and I'm givingthis talk it's as though we stand beforetwo doors behind door number one we stopmaking progress in building intelligentmachines our computer hardware andsoftware just stops getting better forsome reason now take a moment toconsider why this might happen but givenhow valuable intelligence and automationare we will continue to improve ourtechnology if we are at all able to whatcould stop us from doing this afull-scale nuclear war a global pandemican asteroid impact Justin Bieberbecoming president United States thepoint is something would have to destroycivilization as we know it hey you haveto imagine how bad it would have to beto prevent us from making improvementsin our technology permanently ageneration after generation almost bydefinition this is the worst thingthat's ever happened in human history sothe only alternative and this is whatlies behind door number two is that wecontinue to improve our intelligentmachines year after year after year anda certain point we will build machinesthat are smarter than we areand once we have machines that aresmarter than we are they will begin toimprove themselves and then we risk withthe mathematician AI J good called anintelligence explosion that the processcould get away from us now this is oftencaricatured as I have here as a fearthat armies of malicious robots willattack us but that isn't the most likelyscenario a it's not that our machineswill become spontaneously malevolentbecause concern is really that we willbuild machines that are so much morecompetent than we are that the slightestdivergence between their goals in ourown could destroy us just think abouthow we relate to ants okay we don't hatethem we don't go out of our way to harmthem in fact sometimes we take pains notto harm them we just we step over themon the sidewalk but whenever theirpresenceseriously conflicts with one of ourgoals let's say when constructing abuilding like this one we annihilatethem without a qualm the concern is thatwe will one day build machines thatwhether they're conscious or not couldtreat us with similar disregard now Isuspect this seems far-fetched to manyof you I bet they're those of you whodoubt that super intelligent AI ispossiblemuch less inevitable right but then youmust find something wrong with one ofthe following assumptions and they'reonly three of them intelligence is amatter ofinformation processing in physicalsystems okay actually this is a littlebit more than an assumption but we havealready built narrow intelligence intoour machines and many of these machinesperform at a level of superhumanintelligence already and we know thatmere matter can give rise to what iscalled general intelligence and abilityto think flexibly across multipledomains because our brains have managedit right maybe there's just atoms inhere as long as we continue to buildsystems of atoms that display more andmore intelligent behavior we willeventually unless we are interrupted wewill eventually build generalintelligence into our machines it'scrucial to realize that that the rate ofprogress doesn't matter if any progressis enough to get us into the end zone wedon't need Moore's law to continue wedon't we don't need exponential progresswe just need to keep going the secondassumption is that we will keep going wewill continue to improve our intelligentmachines and given the value ofintelligenceyou know intelligence is either thesource of everything we value or we needit to safeguard everything we value itis our most valuable resource so we wantto do this we have problems that wedesperately need to solve we want tocure diseases like Alzheimer's andcancer you want to understand economicsystems we want to improve our climatescience so we will do this if we can theTrain is already out of the station andthere's no brake to pull finally wedon't stand on a peak of intelligence oranywhere near it likely and this reallyis the crucial insight this is whatmakes our situation so precarious andthis is what what makes our intuitionsabout risk so unreliable now justconsider the smartest person who's everlived and almost everyone's shortlisthere is John von Neumann maybe theimpression that fun women made on thepeople around himand this included the greatestmathematicians and physicists of histime it's fairly well documentedif if only half the stories about himare half true that no question he's oneof the smartest people who's ever livedso consider the spectrum of intelligencehere we have john von neumann and thenwe have you and me and then we have achicken sorry a chicken it's no reasonfor me to make this talk more depressingthat needs to be it seems overwhelminglylikely however that the spectrum ofintelligence extends much further thanwe currently conceive and if we buildmachines that are more intelligent thanwe are they will very likely explorethis spectrum in ways that we can'timagine and exceed us in ways that wecan't imagine and it's important torecognize that this is true by virtue ofspeed aloneright so imagine we just built a superintelligent AI right that was no smarterthan your average team of researchers atStanford or MIT well electronic circuitsfunction about a million times fasterthan biochemical ones okay so thismachine should think about a milliontimes faster than the minds have builtit so you said it running for a week andit will perform 20,000 years of humanlevel intellectual work week after weekafter week how could we even understandmuch less constrain in mind making thissort of progress the other thing that'sworrying frankly is that imagine thatimagine the best-case scenario soimagine we we hit upon a design of superintelligent AI that has no safetyconcerns we have the perfect design thefirst time around it's as though we'vebeen handed an oracle that behavesexactly as intended well this machinewould be the perfect labor-saving deviceit can design the machine that can buildthe machine that can do any physicalwork powered by sunlight more or lessfor the cost of raw materials okay sowe're talking about the end of humandrudgery we're also talking about theend of most intellectual work so whatwould a piece like ourselves do in thisourstands well we'd be free to play frisbeeand give each other massages add someLSD and some questionable wardrobechoices and the whole world could belike Burning Man now that might soundpretty good but ask yourself what wouldhappen under our current economic andpolitical order it seems likely that wewould witness a level of wealthinequality and unemployment that we havenever seen before absent the willingnessto immediately put this new wealth tothe surface of all humanity okay well afew trillion areas could raise thecovers of our business magazines whilethe rest of the world would be free tostarve and what would the Russians orthe Chinese do if they heard that somecompany in Silicon Valley was about todeploy a super intelligent AI thismachine would be capable of waging warright right whether to rest rail orcyber with unprecedented power this is awinner-take-all scenario dude to be sixmonths ahead of the competition here isto be 500 thousand years aheadat a minimum okay so it seems that evenmere rumors of this kind of breakthroughcould cause our species to go berserknow one of the the most frighteningthings in my view at this moment are thekinds of things that AI researchers saywhen they want to be reassuring and themost common reason we're told not toworry is time this is all a long way offdon't you know this is this is probablyfifty or a hundred years away oneresearcher has said worrying about AIsafety is like worrying aboutoverpopulation on Mars this is theSilicon Valley version of don't worryyour pretty little head about itno one seems to notice that referencingthe time horizon is a total non sequiturokay if intelligence is just a matter ofinformation processing and we continueto improve our machines we will producesome form of super intelligence and wehave no idea how long it will take us tocreate the conditions to do that safelylet me say that again we have no ideahow long it will take us to create theconditions to do that safely if youhaven't noticed 50 years is not what itused to be and this is 50 years inmonthsthis is how long we've had the iPhonethis is how long with Simpsons has beenon television fifty years is not thatmuch time to meet one of the greatestchallenges our species will ever faceand once again we seem to be failing tohave an appropriate emotional responseto what we have every reason to believeis coming.the the computer scientistStuart Russell has a nice analogy herehe said imagine that we received amessage from an alien civilization whichread people of Earth we will arrive onyour planet in 50 years get ready andnow we're just counting down the monthsuntil the mothership lands okay we wouldfeel a little more urgency than we doanother reason we're told not to worryis that these machines can't help butshare our values because they will beliterally extensions of ourselvesthey'll be grafted on to our brains andwill essentially become their limbicsystems well take a moment to considerthat the safest and only prudent pathforward recommended is to implant thistechnology directly into our brains nowthat this mat may in fact be the safestand only prudent path forward butusually one safety concerns about atechnology have to be pretty much workedout before you stick it inside your headthe deeper problem is that buildingsuper intelligent AI on its own seemslikely to be easier than building superintelligent AI and having a completedneuroscience that allows us toseamlessly integrate our mindsand given that the companies andgovernments doing this work are likelyto perceive themselves to be in a raceagainst all others given that to winthis race is to win the world provide ayou don't destroy it in the next momentthen it seems likely that whatever iseasier to do will get done first nowunfortunately I have a solution to thisproblem or from recommending that moreof us think about it I think we needsomething like a Manhattan Project onthe topic of artificial intelligence notto build it because I think we'llinevitably do that but to understand howto avoid an arms race and to build it ina way that is aligned with our interestswhen you're talking about superintelligent AI that can make changes toitself it would seem it seems that weonly have one chance to get the initialconditions right and even then we willneed to absorb the economic andpolitical consequences of getting themright but the moment we admit thatinformation processing is the source ofintelligence that some appropriatecomputational system is what the basisof intelligence is and we admit that wewill improve these systems continuouslyand we admit that the horizon ofcognition very likely far exceeds whatwe currently know then we have to admitthat we're in the process of buildingsome sort of God now would be a goodtime to make sure it's a god we can livewith thank you very much[Applause]",

   "transcription": "[Music][Music][Applause]so for any of us in this room todaylet's start out by admitting we're luckywe don't live in the world our motherslived in our grandmothers lived in wherecareer choices for women were so limitedand if you're in this room today most ofus grew up in world where we have basiccivil rights and amazingly we still livein a world where some women don't havethem but all that aside we still have aproblem and it's a real problem and theproblem is this women are not making itto the top of any profession anywhere inthe world the numbers tell the storyquite clearly 190 heads of state 9 orwomen of all the people in parliamentsin the world13% are women in the corporate sectorwomen at the top c-level jobs boardseats tops out at 15 16 % the numbershave not moved since 2002 and are goingin the wrong direction even in thenonprofit world a world we sometimesthink of as being led by more womenwomen at the top 20% we also haveanother problem which is that women faceharder choices between professionalsuccess and personal fulfillment arecent study in the u.s. showed that ofsenior managers of married seniormanagers two-thirds of the married menhad children and only one-third of themarried women had children couple ofyears ago I was in New York and I waspitching a deal and I was in one ofthose fancy New York private equityoffices you can picture and I'm in themeeting it's about a three hour meetingand two hours in there's kind of needsto be that bio break and everyone standsup and the partner running the meetingstarts looking really embarrassed and Irealize he doesn't know where thewomen's room is in his office so I startlooking around for moving boxes figuringthey just moved in but I don't see anyand so I said so did you just move intothis office and he said no we've beenhere about a year and I said are youtelling me that I am the only woman tohave pitched a deal in thisthis in a year and he looked at me andhe said yeah or maybe you're the onlyone who had to go to the bathroom so thequestion is how are we gonna fix thishow do we change these numbers at thetop how do we make this different I wantto start out by saying I talked aboutthis about keeping women in theworkforce because I really think that'sthe answer in the high-income part ofour workforce in the people who end upat the top fortune 500 CEO jobs or theequivalent in other industries theproblem I am convinced is that women aredropping out now people talk about thisa lot and they talk about things likeflex time and mentoring and programscompanies should have to train women Iwant to talk about none of that todayeven though that's all really importanttoday I want to focus on what we can doas individuals what are the messages weneed to tell ourselves what are themessages we tell the women that workwith and for us what are the messages wetell our daughters now at the outset Iwant to be very clear that this speechcomes with no judgments I don't have theright answer I don't even have it formyself I left San Francisco where I liveon Monday and I was getting on the planefor this conference and my daughterwho's 3 when I dropped her off atpreschool did that whole hugging the legcrying mom you don't get on the planething this is hard I feel guiltysometimes I know no women whetherthey're at home or whether they're inthe workforce that don't feel thatsometimes so I'm not saying that stayingin the workforce is the right thing foreveryone my talk today is about what themessages are if you do want to stay inthe workforce and I think there are 3-1sit at the table to make your partner areal partner and 3 look at thatdon't leave before you leave number onesit at the table just a couple weeks agoat Facebook we hosted a very seniorgovernment official and he came in tomeet with senior execs from aroundSiliconand everyone kind of sat at the tableand then he had these two women who weretravelling with him who are prettysenior in his department and I kind ofsaid to them sit at the table can't sitat the table and they sat on the side ofthe room when I was in college my senioryear I took a course called Europeanintellectual history don't you love thatkind of thing from college wish I coulddo that now and I took it with myroommate Carrie who was then a brilliantliterary student and went on to be abrilliant literary scholar and mybrother smart guy but a water poloplaying pre-med who was a sophomore butthree of us take this class together andthen Carrie reads all the books in theoriginal creeks in Latin goes to all thelectures I read all the books in Englishand go to most of the lectures mybrother is kind of busy he reads onebook of 12 and goes to a couple oflectures marches himself up to our rooma couple days before the exam to gethimself tutor the three of us go to theexam together and we sit down and westudy you know sit there for three hoursand our little blue notebooks yes I'mthat old and we walk out we look at eachother and we say how'd you do and Carriesays boy I feel like I didn't reallydraw out the main point on the Hegeliandialectic and I say God I really wish Ihad really connected John Locke's theoryof property the Philosopher's thatfollow and my brother says I got the topgrade in the class you got the top gradein the class you don't know anything theproblem with these stories is thatshould they show what the data showswomen systematically underestimate theirown abilities if you test men and womenand you ask them questions on totallyobjective criteria like GPAs men get itwrong slightly high and women get itwrong slightly low women do notnegotiate for themselves in theworkforce a study in the last two yearsof people entering the workforce out ofcollege showed that 57 percent of boysentering or men I guess are negotiatingtheir first salary and only 7 percent ofwomen and most importantly men attributetheir success to themselves and womentributed two other external factors ifyou ask men why they did a good jobthey'll say I'm awesome if you askobviously why are you even asking if youask women why they did a good job whatthey'll say is someone help them theygot lucky they worked really hard whydoes this matter boy it matters a lotbecause no one gets to the corner officeby sitting on the side not at the tableand no one gets the promotion if theydon't think they deserve their successor they don't even understand their ownsuccess I wish the answer were easy Iwish I could just go tell all the youngwomen I work for all these fabulouswomen believe in yourself negotiate foryourself own your own success I wish Icould tell that to my daughterbut it's not that simple because whatthe data shows above all else is onething which is that success andlikeability are positively correlatedfor men and negatively correlated forwomen and everyone's nodding because weall know this to be true there's areally good study that shows this reallywell there's a famous Harvard BusinessSchool study on a woman named HeidiRoizen and she's a operator in a venturecapital company in Silicon Valley andshe uses her contacts to become a verysuccessful venture capitalist in 2002not so long ago a professor who was thenat Columbia University took that caseand made it Heidi Roizen and he gavethat case out both of them to two groupsof studentshe changed exactly one word Heidi toHoward but that one word made a reallybig differencehe then surveyed the students and thegood news was the students both men andwomen thought Heidi and Howard wereequally competent in maths good the badnews was that everyone liked Howard he'sa great guy you want to work for him youwant to spend the day fishing with himbut Heidi not so sure she's a little outfor herself she's a little politicalyou're not sure you'd want to work forher this is the complication we have totell our daughter and our colleagues wehave to tell ourselves to believe we gotthe a to reach for the promotion to sitat the table and we have to do it in aworld where for them theresacrifices they will make for that eventhough for their brothers there will notthe saddest thing about all of us isthat it's really hard to remember thisand I'm about to tell a story which istruly embarrassing for me but I thinkimportant I gave this talk at Facebooknot so long ago to about a hundredemployees and a couple hours later therewas a young woman who works theresitting kind of outside my little deskand she wanted to talk to me and I saidokay and she sat down and we talked andshe said I learned something today Ilearned that I need to keep my hand up Isaid what do you mean she said wellyou're giving this talk and then yousaid you're gonna take two morequestions and I had my hand up with lotsof other people and then you took twomore questions and I put my hand downand I noticed all the women put theirhand down and then you took morequestions only from the men and Ithought to myself wow if it's me whocares about this obviously giving thistalk during this talk I can't evennotice that the men's hands are stillraised and the women's hands are stillraised how good are we as managers ofour companies and our organizations atseeing that the men are reaching foropportunities more than women we've gotto get women to sit at the table messagenumber two make your partner a realpartner I've become convinced that we'vemade more progress in the workforce thanwe have in the home the data shows thisvery clearly if a woman and a man workfull-time and have a child the womandoes twice the amount of housework theman does and the woman does three timesthe amount of childcare the man does soshe's got three jobs or two jobs andhe's got one who do you think it dropsout when someone needs to be home or thecause of the vist are really complicatedand I don't have time to go into themand I don't think Sunday footballwatching and general laziness is thecause I think the cause is morecomplicated I think as a society we putmore pressure on our boys to succeedthan we do on our girls I know men thatstay home and work in the home tosupport wives with careers and it's hardwhen I go tomommy-and-me stuff and I see the fatherthere I noticed that the other mommiesdon't play with him and that's a problembecause we have to make it as importanta job because it's the hardest job inthe worldto work inside the home for people ofboth genders if we're gonna even thingsout and let women stay in the workforcestudies show that households with equalearning and equal responsibilities alsohave half the divorce rate and if thatwasn't good enough motivation foreveryone out there they also have morehow shall I say this on this stage theyknow each other more in the biblicalsense as well message number three don'tleave before you leave I think there's areally deep irony to the fact thatactions women are taking and I see thisall the time with the objective ofstaying in the workforce actually leadto their eventually leaving here's whathappens we're all busy everyone's busy awoman's busy and she starts thinkingabout having a child and from the momentshe starts thinking about having a childshe starts thinking about making roomfor that child how am I gonna fit thisinto everything else I'm doing andliterally from that moment she doesn'traise her hand anymore she doesn't lookfor a promotion she doesn't take on thenew project she doesn't say me I want todo that she starts leaning back theproblem is that let's say she gotpregnant that day that day nine monthsof pregnancy three months of maternityleave six months to catch her breathfast-forward two years more often and asI've seen it women start thinking aboutthis way earlier when they get engagedwhen they get married when they startthinking about trying to have a childwhich didn't take a long time one womancame to see me about this and I kind oflooked at her she looked at all youngand I said so are you and your husbandthinking about having a baby and shesaid oh no I'm not married she didn'teven have a boyfriendI said you're thinking about this justway too early but the point is that whathappens once you start kind of quietlyleaning back everyone who's been throughthis and I'm here to tell you once youhave a child at home your job better bereally good to go back because it's hardto leave that kid at home your job needsto be challenging it needs to berewarding you need to feel like you'remaking a difference and if two years agoyou didn't take a promotion and some guynext to you did if three years ago youstopped looking for new opportunitiesyou're gonna be bored because you shouldhave kept your foot on the gas pedaldon't leave before you leave stay andkeep your foot on the gas pedal untilthe very day you need to leave to taketo take a break for a child and thenmake your decisions don't make decisionstoo far in advance particularly onesyou're not even conscious you're makingmy generation really sadly is not goingto change the numbers at the top they'rejust not moving we are not going to getover 50% of the population in mygeneration there will not be 50% ofpeople at the top of any industry butI'm hopeful that future generations canI think a world that was run where halfof our countries and half of ourcompanies were run by women would be abetter world and it's not just becausepeople would know where the women'sbathroom are even though that would behow it very helpful I think it would bea better world I have two children Ihave a five-year-old son and atwo-year-old daughter I want my son tohave a choice to contribute fully in theworkforce or at home and I want mydaughter to have the choice to not justsucceed but to be liked for heraccomplishments thank you[Applause][Music][Music]sharing that's video on the humanNetwork Cisco welcome to the humanNetwork",

   "transcription": "so on my way here the passenger next tome and I had a very interestingconversation during my flight he told meit seems like the United States has runout of jobs because they're just makingsome up cat psychologist Dog Whisperertornado chaser a couple of seconds laterhe asked me so what do you do and I waslike peace builder every day I work toamplify the voices of women and tohighlight their experiences and theirparticipation and peace processes andconflict resolution and because of mywork I recognize that the only way toensure the full participation of womenglobally is by reclaiming religion nowthis matter is vitally important to meas a young Muslim woman I am very proudof my faith it gives me the strength andconviction to do my work every day it'sthe reason I can be here in front of youbut I can't overlook the damage that hasbeen done in the name of religion notjust my own but all of the world's majorfaiths the misrepresentation and misuseand manipulation of religious Scripturehas influenced our social and culturalnorms our laws our daily lives to apoint where we sometimes don't recognizeit my parents moved from Libya NorthAfrica to Canada in the early 1980s andI am the middle child of 11 children yes11 but growing up I saw my parents bothreligiously devout and spiritual peoplepray and praise God for their blessingsnamely me of course but among othersthey were kind and funny and patientlimitlessly patient the kind of patientsthat having 11 kids forces you to haveand they were fair I was never subjectedto religion through a cultural lens Iwas treated the same the same wasexpected of me I was never taught thatGod judged differently based on genderand my parents understanding of God is amerciful and beneficial friend andprovider shaped the way I looked at theworld now of course my upbringing hadadditional benefits being one of elevenchildren is diplomacy 101 to this dayI'm asked where I went to school likedid you go to a Kennedy School ofGovernment or and I look at the one I'mlike no I went to the MadabaSchool of International Affairs it'sextremely exclusive you would have totalk to my mom to get in lucky for youshe's here so but being one of elevenchildren and having ten siblings teachesyou a lot about power structures andalliances it teaches you focus you haveto talk fast or say less because youwill always get cut off it teaches youthe importance of messaging you have toask questions in the right way to getthe answers you know you want and youhave to say no in the right way to keepthe peace but the most important lessonI learned growing up was the importanceof being at the table when my mom'sfavorite lamp broke I had to be therewhen she was trying to find out how andby who because I had to defend myselfbecause if you're not then the finger ispointed at you and before you know ityou will be grounded I am NOT speakingfrom experience of course when I was 15in 2005 I completed high school and Imoved from Canada Saskatoon to Zoeymy pairhometown in Libya a very traditionalCity mind you I had only ever been toLibya before on vacation and as aseven-year-old girl it was magic it wasice cream and trips to the beach andreally excited relatives turns out it'snot the same as a 15 year old young ladyI very quickly became introduced to thecultural aspect of religion the wordsharam meaning religiously prohibited andi Abe meaning culturally inappropriatewere exchanged carelessly as if theymeant the same thing and have the sameconsequences and I found myself inconversation after conversation withclassmates and colleagues professorsfriends even relatives beginning toquestion my own role and my ownaspirations and even with the foundationmy parents had provided for me I foundmyself questioning the role of women inmy faith so at the Madaba School ofInternational Affairs we go very heavyon the debate and rule number one is doyour research so that's what I did andit surprised me how easy it was to findwomen in my faith who were leaders whowere innovative who were strongpolitically economically even militarilyKhadijah Davila hell I'm have financedthe Islamic movement in its infancy wewouldn't be here if it weren't for herso why weren't we learning about her whyweren't we learning about these womenwhy were women being relegated topositions which predated the teachingsof our faith and why if we are equal inthe eyes of God are we not equal in theeyes of men to me it all came back tothe lessons I had learned as a child thedecision-maker the person who gets tocontrol the message is sitting at thetable and unfortunately inevery single world faiths they are notwomen religious institutions aredominated by men and driven by maleleadership and they create policies intheir likeness and until we can changethe system entirely then we can'trealistically expect to have fulleconomic and political participation ofwomen our foundation is broken my momactually says you can't build a straighthouse on a crooked foundation so in 2011the Libyan Revolution broke out and myfamily was on the front lines andthere's this amazing thing that happensin war a cultural shift almost verytemporary and it was the first time thatI felt it was not only acceptable for meto be involved but it was encouraged itwas demanded myself and other women hada seat at the table we weren't holdinghands or a medium we were part ofdecision-makingwe were information sharing we werecrucial and I wanted and needed for thatchange to be permanent turns out that'snot that easy it only took a few weeksbefore the women that I had previouslyworked with were returning back to theirprevious roles and most of them weredriven by words of encouragement fromreligious and political leaders most ofwho's cited religious scripture as theirdefense it's how they gained popularsupport for their opinions so initiallyI focused on the economic and politicalempowerment of women I thought thatwould lead to cultural and social changeand turns out it does a little but not alot I decided to use their defense as myoffense and I began to cite andhighlight Islamic Scripture as well in2012 and 2013 my organization led thesingle largest and most widespreadcampaign in Libya we entered homes andschools and universities even mosques wespoke to 50,000 people directly andhundreds of thousands more throughbillboards and television commercialsradio commercials and posters and you'reprobably wondering how a woman's rightsorganization was able to do this incommunities which had previously opposedour sheer existenceI used Scripture I used verses from theQuran and sayings of the Prophet hadithhis sayings which are for example thebest of you is the best to their familydo not let your brother oppress anotherfor the first time Friday sermons led bylocal community Imams promoted therights of women they discuss tabooissues like domestic violence policieswere changed in certain communities weactually had to go as far as saying theinternational human rights declarationwhich you oppose because it wasn'twritten by religious scholars well thosesame principles are are in our book soreally the United Nations just copied usby changing the message we were able toprovide an alternative narrative whichpromoted the rights of women in Libyait's something that has now beenreplicated internationally and while I'mnot saying it's easy believe me it's notliberals will say you're using religionand call you a bad conservativeconservatives will call you a lot ofcolorful things I've heard everythingfrom your parents must be extremelyashamed of you false they're my biggestfans too you will not make it to yournext birthday again wrong because I didand I remain a very strong believer thatwomen's rights and religion are notmutually exclusive but we have to be atthe table we have to stop giving up ourposition because by remaining silent weallow for the continuedpersecution and abuse of women worldwideby saying that we're going to fight forwomen's rights and fight extremism withbombs and warfare we completelylocal societies which need to addressthese issues so that they're sustainableit is not easychallenging distorted religiousmessaging you will have your fair shareof insult and ridicule and threats butwe have to do it we have no other optionthan to reclaim the message of humanrights the principles of our faith notfor us not for the women in yourfamily's not for the women in this roomnot even for the women out there but forsocieties that would be transformed withthe participation of women and the onlyway we can do thatour only option is to be and remain atthe table thank you[Applause][Music]",

answersbecause they're unknownI used to puzzle about a lot of thingsas a boy for example what would it feellike to be a dog do fish feel painwell how about insects was the big bangjust an accident I mean is there a Godand if so how are we so sure that it's ahe and not a she why do so many innocentpeople and animals suffer terriblethingsis there really a plan for my lifethere's a future yet to be written or isit already written we just can't see itbut then do I have free will who am ianyway am I just a biological machinebut then why am i conscious what isconsciousnesswell robots become conscious one daywhen I kind of assumed that some day Iwould be told the answers to all thesequestions someone must know right guesswhatno one knows most of those questionspuzzle me more now than ever but divinginto them is exciting because it takesyou to the edge of knowledge and younever know what you'll find there so twoquestions questions that no one on earthknows the answer tosometimes when I'm in a long planeflight I gaze out at all those mountainsand deserts and try to get my head roundhow vast our earth is and then Iremember there's an object we see everyday that would literally fit 1 millionEarth's inside it the Sun seemsimpossibly big but in the great schemeof things it's a pinprick one of about400 billion stars in the Milky Waygalaxy which you can see on a clearnight as a pale white mist stretchedacross the sky and it gets worse theremay be a hundred billion galaxiesdetectable by our telescopes so if eachstar was the size of a single grain ofsand just the Milky Way has enough starsto fill a 30-foot by 30-foot stretch ofbeach three feet deep was sand and theentire Earth doesn't have enough beachesto represent the stars in the overalluniverse as such a beach would continuefor literally hundreds of millions ofmiles holy Stephen Hawking that is a lotof stars but he and other physicists nowbelieve in a reality that isunimaginably bigger still I mean firstof all the hundred billion galaxieswithin range of our telescopes areprobably a miniscule fraction of thetotal space itself is expanding at anaccelerating pace the vast majority ofthe galaxies are separating from us sofast that light from them may neverreach us still our physical reality hereon earth is intimately connected tothose distant invisible galaxies and wecould think of them as part of ouruniverse they make up a single giantedifice obeying the same physical lawsand all made from the same types ofatoms electrons protons quarks neutrinosthat make up you and me however recenttheories in physics including one calledstring theory and now telling us therecould be countless other universes builton different types of particles withdifferent properties obeying differentlaws most of these universes could eversupport life and might flash in and outof existence in a nanosecond butnonetheless combined they make up a vastmultiverse of possible universes in upto 11 dimensionsfeaturing wonders beyond ourjust imagination and the leading versionof string theory predicts a multiversemade up of 10 to the 500 universes it'sa one followed by 500 zeroes a number sovast that if every atom in ourobservable universe had its own universeand all of the atoms in all thoseuniverses each had their own universeand you repeated that for two morecycles you'd still be at a tiny fractionof the total namely one trilliontrillion trillion trillion trilliontrillion trillion trillion trilliontrillion trillion trillion trilliontrillion trillionth but even that numberis miniscule compared to another numberinfinity some physicists think thespace-time continuum is literallyinfinite and that it contains aninfinite number of so-called pocketuniverses with varying properties asyour brain doing quantum theory adds awhole new wrinkle I mean the theory hasbeen proven true beyond all doubt butinterpreting it is baffling and somephysicists think you can only unbeli ifyou imagine that huge numbers ofparallel universes are being spawnedevery moment and many of these universeswould actually be very like the worldwere in would include multiple copies ofyou in one such universe you graduatewith honors and marry the person of yourdreams in another not so much well thereare still some scientists who would sayhogwash the only meaningful answer thequestion of how many universes there areis one only one universe and a fewphilosophers and mystics like the howcould that even our own universe is anillusion so as you can see right nowthere is no agreement on this questionnot even closeall we know is the answer is somewherebetween 0 and infinity well I guess weknow one other thing this is a prettycool time to be studying physics we justmight be undergoing the biggest paradigmshift in knowledge that humanity hasever seensomewhere out there in that vastuniverse there must surely be countlessother planets teeming with life but whydon't we see any evidence of it wellthis is the famous question asked byEnrico Fermi in 1950 where is everybodyconspiracy theorists claim that UFOs arevisiting all the timeand the reports are just being coveredup but honestly they aren't veryconvincing but that leaves a real riddlein the past year the Kepler spaceobservatory has found hundreds ofplanets just around nearby stars and ifyou extrapolate that data it looks likethere could be half a trillion planetsjust in our own galaxy if only one inten thousand has conditions that mightsupport a form of life that's still 50million possible life harboring planetsright here in the Milky Way so here'sthe riddle our earth didn't form untilabout 9 billion years after the Big Bangcountless other planets in our galaxyshould have formed earlier and givenlife a chance to get underway billionsor certainly many millions of yearsearlier than happened on earth if just afew of them had spawned intelligent lifeand started creating technologies thosetechnologies would have had millions ofyears to grow in complexity and power onearth we've seen how dramaticallytechnology can accelerate in just 100years in millions of yearsan intelligent alien civilization couldeasily have spread out across the galaxyperhaps creating giantenergy harvesting artifacts or fleets ofcolonizing space ships or glorious worksof art that fill the night sky at thevery least you'd think they'd berevealing their presence deliberately orotherwise through electromagneticsignals of one kind or another and yetwe see no convincing evidence of any ofit why well there are numerous possibleanswers

   "title": "Can you solve the prisoner hat riddle? - Alex Gendler",
   "publishedAt": "05 Oct 2015",
   "transcription": "You and nine other individuals have been capturedby super intelligent alien overlords.The aliens think humans look quite tasty,but their civilization forbids eatinghighly logical and cooperative beings.Unfortunately, they're not sure whether you qualify,so they decide to give you all a test.Through its universal translator,the alien guarding you tells you the following:You will be placed in a single-file linefacing forward in size orderso that each of you can see everyone lined up ahead of you.You will not be able to look behind youor step out of line.Each of you will have either a blackor a white hat on your headassigned randomly,and I won't tell you how many of each color there are.When I say to begin, each of you mustguess the color of your hatstarting with the person in the backand moving up the line.And don't even try saying wordsother than black or whiteor signaling some other way,like intonation or volume;you'll all be eaten immediately.If at least nine of you guess correctly,you'll all be spared.You have five minutes to discussand come up with a plan,and then I'll line you up,assign your hats, and we'll begin.Can you think of a strategy guaranteedto save everyone?Pause the video now to figure it out for yourself.Answer in: 3Answer in: 2Answer in: 1The key is that the person at the back of the linewho can see everyone else's hatscan use the words \"black\" or \"white\"to communicate some coded information.So what meaning can be assigned to those wordsthat will allow everyone else to deduce their hat colors?It can't be the total numberof black or white hats.There are more than two possible values,but what does have two possible valuesis that number's parity,that is whether it's odd or even.So the solution is to agreethat whoever goes first will,for example, say \"black\" if he seesan odd number of black hatsand \"white\" if he sees an even number of black hats.Let's see how it would play outif the hats were distributed like this.The tallest captive sees three blackhats in front of him,so he says \"black,\" telling everyone elsehe sees an odd number of black hats.He gets his own hat color wrong,but that's okaysince you're collectively allowed to have one wrong answer.Prisoner two also sees an oddnumber of black hats,so she knows hers is white,and answers correctly.Prisoner three sees an even number of black hats,so he knows that his must be one of the black hatsthe first two prisoners saw.Prisoner four hears that and knowsthat she should be looking for an even number of black hatssince one was behind her.But she only sees one, so she deducesthat her hat is also black.Prisoners five through nine are eachlooking for an odd number of black hats,which they see, so they figure outthat their hats are white.Now it all comes down to youat the front of the line.If the ninth prisoner saw an odd number of black hats,that can only mean one thing.You'll find that this strategy worksfor any possible arrangement of the hats.The first prisoner has a 50% chance ofgiving a wrong answer about his own hat,but the parity information he conveysallows everyone else to guess theirs with absolute certainty.Each begins by expecting to see an oddor even number of hatsof the specified color.If what they count doesn't match,that means their own hat is that color.And everytime this happens,the next person in line will switchthe parity they expect to see.So that's it, you're free to go.It looks like these aliens will have to go hungry,or find some less logical organisms to abduct.",

   "title": "What makes muscles grow? - Jeffrey Siegel",
   "publishedAt": "03 Nov 2015",
   "transcription": "Muscles.We have over 600 of them.They make up between 1/3 and 1/2 of our body weight,and along with connective tissue,they bind us together, hold us up,and help us move.And whether or not body buildingis your hobby,muscles need your constant attentionbecause the way you treat them on a daily basisdetermines whether they will wither or grow.Say you're standing in front of a door,ready to pull it open.Your brain and muscles are perfectlypoised to help you achieve this goal.First, your brain sends a signalto motor neurons inside your arm.When they receive this message,they fire,causing muscles to contract and relax,which pull on the bones in your armand generate the needed movement.The bigger the challenge becomes,the bigger the brain's signal grows,and the more motor units it ralliesto help you achieve your task.But what if the door is made of solid iron?At this point, your arm muscles alonewon't be able to generate enough tension to pull it open,so your brain appeals to other muscles for help.You plant your feet, tighten your belly,and tense your back,generating enough force to yank it open.Your nervous system has just leveragedthe resources you already have,other muscles,to meet the demand.While all this is happening,your muscle fibers undergo another kind of cellular change.As you expose them to stress,they experience microscopic damage,which, in this context, is a good thing.In response, the injured cells releaseinflammatory molecules called cytokinesthat activate the immune systemto repair the injury.This is when the muscle-building magic happens.The greater the damage to the muscle tissue,the more your body will need to repair itself.The resulting cycle of damage and repaireventually makes muscles bigger and strongeras they adapt to progressively greater demands.Since our bodies have already adaptedto most everyday activities,those generally don't produce enough stressto stimulate new muscle growth.So, to build new muscle,a process called hypertrophy,our cells need to be exposed to higherworkloads than they are used to.In fact, if you don't continuously exposeyour muscles to some resistance,they will shrink,a process known as muscular atrophy.In contrast, exposing the muscleto a high-degree of tension,especially while the muscle is lengthening,also called an eccentric contraction,generates effective conditionsfor new growth.However, muscles rely on more thanjust activity to grow.Without proper nutrition, hormones, and rest,your body would never be ableto repair damaged muscle fibers.Protein in our diet preserves muscle massby providing the building blocks for new tissuein the form of amino acids.Adequate protein intake,along with naturally occurring hormones,like insulin-like growth factorand testosterone,help shift the body into a statewhere tissue is repaired and grown.This vital repair process mainly occurswhen we're resting,especially at night while sleeping.Gender and age affect this repair mechanism,which is why young men with more testosteronehave a leg up in the muscle building game.Genetic factors also play a rolein one's ability to grow muscle.Some people have more robust immune reactions to muscle damage,and are better able to repairand replace damaged muscle fibers,increasing their muscle-building potential.The body responds to the demandsyou place on it.If you tear your muscles up,eat right, rest and repeat,you'll create the conditions to make yourmuscles as big and strong as possible.It is with muscles as it is with life:Meaningful growth requires challengeand stress.",

   "title": "Can you solve the famously difficult green-eyed logic puzzle? - Alex Gendler",
   "publishedAt": "16 Jun 2015",
   "transcription": "Imagine an island where 100 people,all perfect logicians,are imprisoned by a mad dictator.There's no escape,except for one strange rule.Any prisoner can approach the guardsat night and ask to leave.If they have green eyes, they'll be released.If not, they'll be tossed into the volcano.As it happens, all 100 prisoners have green eyes,but they've lived there since birth,and the dictator has ensuredthey can't learn their own eye color.There are no reflective surfaces,all water is in opaque containers,and most importantly,they're not allowed to communicate among themselves.Though they do see each otherduring each morning's head count.Nevertheless, they all know no one wouldever risk trying to leavewithout absolute certainty of success.After much pressure from human rights groups,the dictator reluctantly agreesto let you visit the islandand speak to the prisonersunder the following conditions:you may only make one statement,and you cannot tell them any new information.What can you say to help free the prisonerswithout incurring the dictator's wrath?After thinking long and hard,you tell the crowd, \"At least one of you has green eyes.\"The dictator is suspiciousbut reassures himself that your statementcouldn't have changed anything.You leave, and life on the islandseems to go on as before.But on the hundredth morning after your visit,all the prisoners are gone,each having asked to leavethe previous night.So how did you outsmart the dictator?It might help to realize that the amountof prisoners is arbitrary.Let's simplify thingsby imagining just two, Adria and Bill.Each sees one person with green eyes,and for all they know, that could be the only one.For the first night, each stays put.But when they see each other still there in the morning,they gain new information.Adria realizes that if Bill had seena non-green-eyed person next to him,he would have left the first nightafter concluding the statement could only refer to himself.Bill simultaneously realizes the same thing about Adria.The fact that the other person waitedtells each prisoner hisor her own eyes must be green.And on the second morning, they're both gone.Now imagine a third prisoner.Adria, Bill and Carl each see two green-eyed people,but aren't sure if each of the othersis also seeing two green-eyed people,or just one.They wait out the first night as before,but the next morning, they still can't be sure.Carl thinks, \"If I have non-green eyes,Adria and Bill were just watching each other,and will now both leave on the second night.\"But when he sees both of them the third morning,he realizes they must have been watching him, too.Adria and Bill have each been going through the same process,and they all leave on the third night.Using this sort of inductive reasoning,we can see that the pattern will repeatno matter how many prisoners you add.The key is the concept of common knowledge,coined by philosopher David Lewis.The new information was not containedin your statement itself,but in telling it to everyone simultaneously.Now, besides knowing at least oneof them has green eyes,each prisoner also knows that everyone else is keeping trackof all the green-eyed people they can see,and that each of them also knows this, and so on.What any given prisoner doesn't knowis whether they themselves are oneof the green-eyed peoplethe others are keeping track ofuntil as many nights have passedas the number of prisoners on the island.Of course, you could have sparedthe prisoners 98 days on the islandby telling them at least 99 of youhave green eyes,but when mad dictators are involved,you're best off with a good headstart.",

   "title": "Which is stronger: Glue or tape? - Elizabeth Cox",
   "publishedAt": "30 Apr 2018",
   "transcription": "The oldest glue in the world is over 8,000 years oldand comes from a cave near the Dead Sea.Ancient people used this glue,made from a mixture of animal bone and plant materials,to waterproof baskets and construct utensils.And for thousands of years after,plants and animals were the glue that held human civilization together.Today, we have enough types of tape andglue to build and repair almost anything.But what gives glue and tape their stickiness?And is one stronger than the other?Adhesives can be made from synthetic moleculesor natural proteins and carbohydrateslike the vegetable starch dextrin,the milk protein casein,and the terpenes in tree resin.In order to work, glue and tape need both adhesive bonds and cohesive bonds.Adhesive bonds occur between an adhesive\u2019s moleculesand the molecules of whatever it\u2019s sticking to.Cohesive bonds happen between a glue or tape\u2019s own molecules,holding it together.Most glues consist of adhesive polymers dissolved in a solventthat prevents them from stickingto the inside of the bottle.The strong smell of many glues comes from the solvent,which evaporates when exposed to air.Some glues use water as a solvent,but others use chemicals that can be harmful to inhale.Glues with two or more components thatchemically react instead of just dryingcan create stronger bonds.Both the adhesive and cohesive bonds of glue are strong,but the drying process makes them irreversible.This is why, if a glued surface is broken after it dries,it can\u2019t be reattached without new glue.By contrast, when tape is applied to a surface,it forms weaker, reversible bonds,so you can peel a piece of tape off a surface and use it again.These weak bonds, called Van der Waals forces,can occur between any two materials,but only if they\u2019re extremely close together,closer than the naked eye can see.Tape usually consists of a backing coated with a combination of a rubberor rubber-like \"stretchy\" component,and a compound called a tackifier.That\u2019s the \"sticky\" component.A tape\u2019s stickiness is determinedby the proportion of elastic component and tackifier,the thickness of adhesive spread onto the backing,and the type of backing material.No chemical reaction occurs when tape is pressed onto a surface.Instead, the soft adhesive flows into the cracks and grooves of the surface.This ability to slide into cracks and thenstay in place is called viscoelasticity.Once the viscoelastic adhesive fills these microscopic crevices,it is close enough to form Van der Waals forces.So what\u2019s the world\u2019s strongest adhesive?Well, there\u2019s no one answer.In terms of absolute strength of adhesive bonds,glue is stronger than tape,but no single adhesiveworks well in all circumstances.Of the glues, cyanoacrylates, or super glues,may form the strongest bonds,but two-component epoxy glues have muchhigher resistance to heat and shearing,and are compatible with a wider range of surfaces.So, if you wanted to dangle an anvil in the air,super glue might be your best bet.But if you\u2019re doing so over an active volcano,you\u2019d want an epoxy instead.And in order to work at all,glues need enough real estate where surfaces touch.If for some reason you wanted to make a chain of bowling balls,duct tape would be better.Engineers weigh similar, if less absurd, factors all the time.Choosing the right glue to withstand the heat inside an engineis a matter of life and death.And though the strength of duct tape\u2019s adhesive bondscan\u2019t compete with those of epoxy glues,tape does have the advantage of instantaneous stickiness in an emergency.Glue may be necessary to get a rocket to space,but when it comes to extraterrestrial repairs,stick to duct tape: liquid glues don\u2019t work in zero gravity.",

   "title": "How Thor got his hammer - Scott A. Mellor",
   "publishedAt": "07 Jan 2019",
   "transcription": "Loki the mischief-maker, was writhinguncomfortably in Thor\u2019s iron grip.The previous night, while the rest of thegods slept, he\u2019d snuck up on Thor\u2019s wifeSif and shorn off her beautiful hair.It\u2019d seemed like a funny prank at the time,but now Thor was about tobreak every bone in his body.Loki had to think of someway to fix what he\u2019d done.Yet who could replace Sif\u2019s matchlesshair, golden like a field of summer wheat?The dwarves! \u2013 their legendarysmiths could make anything.So Loki rushed to their realm, deep within the mountains of the earth.Even before he arrived, the wily Loki wasalready scheminghow he would get thedwarves to do his bidding.He decided that his best bet was to pittwo families against each other.He first visited the masterfulsons of Ivaldi. He told them that their rivals,a pair of brothers named Brokk and Eitri,had claimed that they were the bestcraftsmen in the worldand were determined to proveit in a competition.The rules were that each family had to create three gifts for the gods,including, for the Ivaldis, golden hair.Then Loki visited Brokk and Eitri,and told them the same thing, only now claiming that the sonsof Ivaldi had issued the challenge.But Brokk and Eitri couldn\u2019t be fooled so easily,and only agreed to participateif Loki put his own head on the line.Literally\u2014if Brokk and Eitri won, Loki would forfeit his head to them.Loki had no choice but to agree,and to save himself had to find a wayto make sure the sons ofIvaldi emerged victorious.Both sets of dwarves got to work.Eitri set Brokk to man the bellows andtold him not to stop for any reason,or the treasures would be ruined.Soon a strange black flyflew into the room.As a piece of pigskin was placed in theforge, the fly stung Brokk\u2019s hand,but he didn\u2019t flinch.Next, while Eitri worked a block of gold,the fly bit Brokk on the neck.The dwarf carried on.Finally, Eitri placed a pieceof iron in the furnace.This time the fly landed right on Brokk\u2019seyelid and bit as hard as it could.And for just a split second,Brokk\u2019s hand left the bellows.That\u2019s all it took; their final treasurehadn\u2019t stayed in the fire long enough.Loki now reappeared in his normal form,overjoyed by their failure,and accompanied the dwarves to presenttheir treasures to the gods.First, Loki presented the treasuresfrom the sons of Ivaldi.Their golden hair bound to Sif\u2019shead and continued to grow,leaving her even more radiant than before.Next, for Odin the all-father,a magnificent spear that couldpierce through anything.And finally a small cloth that unfoldedinto a mighty ship built for Freyr,god of the harvest.Then Brokk presented the treasuresmade by him and his brother.For Freyr they\u2019d forged a golden-bristled boarwho\u2019d pull Freyr\u2019s chariot acrossthe sky faster than any mount.For Odin, a golden arm ring which wouldmake eight more identical ringson every ninth night.And for Thor, a hammer called Mjolnir.Its handle was too short,and Loki smirked at the obvious defect.But then Brokk revealed its abilities.Mjolnir would never shatter, never miss its markand always returnto Thor\u2019s hand when thrown.Despite the short handle, the gods all agreed this was the finest gift of all.Remembering what was at stake, Loki tried to flee, but Thor reached him first.But before the dwarves could have their due,clever Loki pointed out that they had wonthe rights to his head, but not his neck,and thus had no right to cut it.All begrudgingly admitted the truth in that,but Brokk would have the last laugh.Taking his brother\u2019s awl,he pierced it through Loki\u2019s lipsand sewed his mouth shut,so the trickster god could no longerspread his malicious deceit.Yet the irony was not lost on the gods.For it was Loki\u2019s deceit that had broughtthem these fine treasuresand given Thor the hammerfor which he\u2019s still known today.",

   "title": "What would happen if you didn\u2019t drink water? - Mia Nacamulli",
   "publishedAt": "29 Mar 2016",
   "transcription": "Water is virtually everywhere,from soil moisture and ice caps,to the cells inside our own bodies.Depending on factors like location,fat index,age,and sex,the average human is between 55-60% water.At birth, human babies are even wetter.Being 75% water, they are swimmingly similar to fish.But their water composition drops to 65%by their first birthday.So what role does water play in our bodies,and how much do we actually need to drinkto stay healthy?The H20 in our bodies works to cushionand lubricate joints,regulate temperature,and to nourish the brain and spinal cord.Water isn't only in our blood.An adult's brain and heart are almostthree quarters water.That's roughly equivalent to the amountof moisture in a banana.Lungs are more similar to an apple at 83%.And even seemingly dry human bonesare 31% water.If we are essentially made of water,and surrounded by water,why do we still need to drink so much?Well, each day we lose two to three litersthrough our sweat,urine,and bowel movements,and even just from breathing.While these functions are essential to our survival,we need to compensate for the fluid loss.Maintaining a balanced water levelis essential to avoid dehydrationor over-hydration,both of which can have devastatingeffects on overall health.At first detection of low water levels,sensory receptors in the brain's hypothalamussignal the release of antidiuretic hormone.When it reached the kidneys, it creates aquaporins,special channels that enable bloodto absorb and retain more water,leading to concentrated, dark urine.Increased dehydration can causenotable drops in energy,mood,skin moisture,and blood pressure,as well as signs of cognitive impairment.A dehydrated brain works harder to accomplish the same amountas a normal brain,and it even temporarily shrinksbecause of its lack of water.Over-hydration, or hyponatremia,is usually caused by overconsumptionof water in a short amount of time.Athletes are often the victims of over-hydrationbecause of complications in regulating water levelsin extreme physical conditions.Whereas the dehydrated brain ampsup the production of antidiuretic hormone,the over-hydrated brain slows,or even stops, releasing it into the blood.Sodium electrolytes in the bodybecome diluted,causing cells to swell.In severe cases,the kidneys can't keep up with the resulting volumes of dilute urine.Water intoxication then occurs,possibly causing headache,vomiting,and, in rare instances, seizuresor death.But that's a pretty extreme situation.On a normal, day-to-day basis,maintaining a well-hydrated systemis easy to managefor those of us fortunate enough to have access to clean drinking water.For a long time, conventional wisdom saidthat we should drink eight glasses a day.That estimate has since been fine-tuned.Now, the consensus is that the amountof water we need to imbibedepends largely on our weightand environment.The recommended daily intake varies frombetween 2.5-3.7 liters of water for men,and about 2-2.7 liters for women,a range that is pushed up or down if we are healthy,active,old,or overheating.While water is the healthiest hydrator,other beverages,even those with caffeine like coffee or tea,replenish fluids as well.And water within food makes up about a fifth of our daily H20 intake.Fruits and vegetables like strawberries,cucumbers,and even broccoli are over 90% water,and can supplement liquid intake whileproviding valuable nutrients and fiber.Drinking well might also have variouslong-term benefits.Studies have shown that optimal hydrationcan lower the chance of stroke,help manage diabetes,and potentially reduce the riskof certain types of cancer.No matter what, getting the right amountof liquid makes a world of differencein how you'll feel,think,and function day to day.",

   "title": "The benefits of a bilingual brain - Mia Nacamulli",
   "publishedAt": "23 Jun 2015",
   "transcription": "\u00bfHablas espa\u00f1ol? Parlez-vous fran\u00e7ais? \u4f60\u4f1a\u8bf4\u4e2d\u6587\u5417\uff1fIf you answered, \"s\u00ed,\" \"oui,\" or \"\u4f1a\"and you're watching this in English,chances are you belong to the world'sbilingual and multilingual majority.And besides having an easier time travelingor watching movies without subtitles,knowing two or more languagesmeans that your brainmay actually look and work differentlythan those of your monolingual friends.So what does it really mean to know a language?Language ability is typically measuredin two active parts, speaking and writing,and two passive parts, listening and reading.While a balanced bilingual has near equalabilities across the board in two languages,most bilinguals around the worldknow and use their languagesin varying proportions.And depending on their situationand how they acquired each language,they can be classified intothree general types.For example, let's take Gabriella,whose family immigrates to the US from Peru when she's two-years old.As a compound bilingual,Gabriella develops two linguistic codes simultaneously,with a single set of concepts,learning both English and Spanishas she begins to process the world around her.Her teenage brother, on the other hand,might be a coordinate bilingual,working with two sets of concepts,learning English in school,while continuing to speak Spanishat home and with friends.Finally, Gabriella's parents are likelyto be subordinate bilingualswho learn a secondary languageby filtering it throughtheir primary language.Because all types of bilingual peoplecan become fully proficient in a languageregardless of accent or pronunciation,the difference may not be apparentto a casual observer.But recent advances in brain imaging technologyhave given neurolinguists a glimpseinto how specific aspects of languagelearning affect the bilingual brain.It's well known that the brain'sleft hemisphere is more dominantand analytical in logical processes,while the right hemisphere is more activein emotional and social ones,though this is a matter of degree,not an absolute split.The fact that language involvesboth types of functionswhile lateralization developsgradually with age,has lead to the critical period hypothesis.According to this theory,children learn languages more easilybecause the plasticity of their developing brainslets them use both hemispheresin language acquisition,while in most adults, language is lateralized to one hemisphere,usually the left.If this is true, learning a languagein childhoodmay give you a more holistic graspof its social and emotional contexts.Conversely, recent research showedthat people who learned a second language in adulthoodexhibit less emotional biasand a more rational approachwhen confronting problemsin the second languagethan in their native one.But regardless of when you acquireadditional languages,being multilingual gives your brainsome remarkable advantages.Some of these are even visible,such as higher density of the grey matterthat contains most of your brain's neurons and synapses,and more activity in certain regionswhen engaging a second language.The heightened workout a bilingualbrain receives throughout its lifecan also help delay the onset of diseases,like Alzheimer's and dementiaby as much as five years.The idea of major cognitive benefits to bilingualismmay seem intuitive now,but it would have surprised earlier experts.Before the 1960s, bilingualismwas considered a handicapthat slowed a child's developmentby forcing them to spend too much energydistinguishing between languages,a view based largely on flawed studies.And while a more recent study did showthat reaction times and errors increasefor some bilingual studentsin cross-language tests,it also showed that the effortand attention neededto switch between languagestriggered more activity in,and potentially strengthened,the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.This is the part of the brainthat plays a large rolein executive function, problem solving,switching between tasks,and focusing while filtering outirrelevant information.So, while bilingualism may notnecessarily make you smarter,it does make your brain more healthy,complex and actively engaged,and even if you didn't have the good fortuneof learning a second language as a child,it's never too late to do yourself a favorand make the linguistic leap from, \"Hello,\"to, \"Hola,\" \"Bonjour\" or \"\u4f60\u597d\u2019s\"because when it comes to our brainsa little exercise can go a long way.",

   "transcription": "Why do cats do that?They're cute, they're lovable,and judging by the 26 billions viewsof over 2 million YouTube videosof them pouncing,bouncing,climbing,cramming,stalking,clawing,chattering,and purring,one thing is certain:cats are very entertaining.These somewhat strange feline behaviors,both amusing and baffling,leave many of us asking,\"Why do cats do that?\"Throughout time, cats were simultaneouslysolitary predators of smaller animalsand prey for larger carnivores.As both predator and prey,survival of their species dependedon crucial instinctual behaviorswhich we still observe in wild and domestic cats today.While the feline actions of your house catGrizmo might seem perplexing,in the wild, these same behaviors,naturally bred into cats for millions of years,would make Grizmo a super cat.Enabled by their unique muscular structureand keen balancing abilities,cats climbed to high vantage pointsto survey their territoryand spot prey in the wild.Grizmo doesn't need these particularskills to find and hunt down dinnerin her food bowl today,but instinctually, viewing the living roomfrom the top of the bookcaseis exactly what she has evolved to do.As wild predators, cats are opportunisticand hunt whenever prey is available.Since most cat prey are small,cats in the wild needed to eat many times each day,and use a stalk, pounce, kill, eatstrategy to stay fed.This is why Grizmo prefers to chaseand pounce on little toysand eat small meals over the courseof the day and night.Also, small prey tend to hide in tinyspaces in their natural environments,so one explanation for Grizmo's propensityto reach into containers and openingsis that she is compelled by the same curiositythat helped ensure the continuation ofher species for millions of years before.In the wild, cats needed sharp clawsfor climbing, hunting, and self-defense.Sharpening their claws on nearby surfaceskept them conditioned and ready,helped stretch their back and leg muscles,and relieve some stress, too.So, it's not that Grizmo hates your couch,chair,ottoman,pillows,curtains,and everything else you put in her environment.She's ripping these things to shredsand keeping her claws in tip-top shapebecause this is exactly what her ancestorsdid in order to survive.As animals that were preyed upon,cats evolved to not get caught,and in the wild, the cats that were the best at avoiding predators thrived.So at your house today,Grizmo is an expert at squeezing into small spacesand seeking out and hidingin unconventional spots.It also explains why she prefersa clean and odor-free litter box.That's less likely to give away her location to any predatorsthat may be sniffing around nearby.Considering everything we do know about cats,it seems that one of their most predominate behaviorsis still one of the most mysterious.Cats may purr for any number of reasons,such as happiness,stress,and hunger.But curiously, the frequency of their purrs,between 25 and 150 hertz,is within a range that can promotetissue regeneration.So while her purring makes Grizmoan excellent nap companion,it is also possible that her purris healing her muscles and bones,and maybe even yours, too.They developed through timeas both solitary predators that hunted and killed to eat,and stealthy prey that hidand escaped to survive.So cats today retain many of the same instinctsthat allowed them to thrive in the wildfor millions of years.This explains some of their seeminglystrange behaviors.To them, our homes are their jungles.But if this is the case, in our own cat's eyes,who are we?Big, dumb, hairless cats competing withthem for resources?Terribly stupid predators they're ableto outsmart every day?Or maybe they think we're the prey.",

   "title": "Can you solve the prisoner boxes riddle? - Yossi Elran",
   "publishedAt": "03 Oct 2016",
   "transcription": "Your favorite band is greatat playing music,but not so great at being organized.They keep misplacing their instruments on tour,and it's driving their manager mad.On the day of the big concert,the band wakes up to find themselves tied upin a windowless, soundproof practice room.Their manager explains what's happening.Outside, there are ten large boxes.Each contains one of your instruments,but don't be fooled by the pictures -they've been randomly placed.I'm going to let you out one at a time.While you're outside, you can lookinside any five boxesbefore securitytakes you back to the tour bus.You can't touch the instrumentsor in any way communicate what you findto the others.No marking the boxes, shouting, nothing.If each one of you can find your own instrument,then you can play tonight.Otherwise, the label is dropping you.You have three minutes to think about itbefore we start.The band is in despair.After all, each musician only has a 50%chance of finding their instrumentby picking five random boxes.And the chances that all ten will succeedare even lower -just 1 in 1024.But suddenly, the drummer comes upwith a valid strategythat has a better than 35% chanceof working.Can you figure out what it was?Pause the video on the next screenif you want to figure it out for yourself!Answer in: 3Answer in: 2Answer in: 1Here's what the drummer said:Everyone first open the boxwith the picture of your instrument.If your instrument is inside, you're done.Otherwise, look at whatever's in there,and then open the box with that picture on it.Keep going that way until you findyour instrument.The bandmates are skeptical,but amazingly enough,they all find what they need.And a few hours later, they're playingto thousands of adoring fans.So why did the drummer's strategy work?Each musician follows a linked sequencethat starts with the box whose outsidematches their instrumentand ends with the box actually containing it.Note that if they kept going,that would lead them back to the start,so this is a loop.For example, if the boxes are arranged like so,the singer would open the first boxto find the drums,go to the eighth box to find the bass,and find her microphone in the third box,which would point back to the first.This works much better than random guessingbecause by starting with the box with the picture of their instrument,each musician restricts their search tothe loop that contains their instrument,and there are decent odds, about 35%,that all of the loops will be of length five or less.How do we calculate those odds?For the sake of simplicity, we'll demonstrate with a simplified case,four instruments and no more than two guesses allowed for each musician.Let's start by finding the odds of failure,the chance that someone will needto open three or four boxesbefore they find their instrument.There are six distinct four-box loops.One fun way to count them is to make a square,put an instrument at each corner,and draw the diagonals.See how many unique loops you can find,and keep in mind that these two are considered the same,they just start at different points.These two, however, are different.We can visualize the eight distinctthree-box loops using triangles.You'll find four possible trianglesdepending on which instrument you leave out,and two distinct paths on each.So of the 24 possible combinations of boxes,there are 14 that lead to faliure,and ten that result in success.That computational strategy works for anyeven number of musicians,but if you want a shortcut,it generalizes to a handy equation.Plug in ten musicians, and we get odds of about 35%.What if there were 1,000 musicians?1,000,000?As n increases, the odds approach about 30%.Not a guarantee, but with a bit ofmusician's luck, it's far from hopeless.Hi everybody, if you liked this riddle,try solving these two.",

   "title": "The psychology of narcissism - W. Keith Campbell",
   "publishedAt": "23 Feb 2016",
   "transcription": "Way before the first selfie,the ancient Greeks and Romans had a mythabout someone a little too obsessed with his own image.In one telling,Narcissus was a handsome guy wanderingthe world in search of someone to love.After rejecting a nymph named Echo,he caught a glimpse of his own reflection in a river,and fell in love with it.Unable to tear himself away,Narcissus drowned.A flower marked the spot of where he died,and we call that flower the Narcissus.The myth captures the basic idea of narcissism,elevated and sometimes detrimental self-involvement.But it's not just a personality typethat shows up in advice columns.It's actually a set of traits classifiedand studied by psychologists.The psychological definition of narcissismis an inflated, grandiose self-image.To varying degrees, narcissists thinkthey're better looking,smarter,and more important than other people,and that they deserve special treatment.Psychologists recognize two formsof narcissism as a personality trait:grandiose and vulnerable narcissism.There's also narcissistic personality disorder,a more extreme form,which we'll return to shortly.Grandiose narcissism is the most familiar kind,characterized by extroversion,dominance,and attention seeking.Grandiose narcissists pursue attention and power,sometimes as politicians,celebrities,or cultural leaders.Of course, not everyone who pursuesthese positions of power is narcissistic.Many do it for very positive reasons,like reaching their full potential,or helping make people's lives better.But narcissistic individuals seek powerfor the status and attention that goes with it.Meanwhile, vulnerable narcissistscan be quiet and reserved.They have a strong sense of entitlement,but are easily threatened or slighted.In either case, the dark side ofnarcissism shows up over the long term.Narcissists tend to act selfishly,so narcissistic leaders may make riskyor unethical decisions,and narcissistic partners may be dishonestor unfaithful.When their rosy view of themselvesis challenged,they can become resentful and aggressive.It's like a disease where the sufferersfeel pretty good,but the people around them suffer.Taken to the extreme,this behavior is classified as a psychological disordercalled narcissistic personality disorder.It affects one to two percentof the population,more commonly men.It is also a diagnosis reserved for adults.Young people, especially children,can be very self-centered,but this might just be a normalpart of development.The fifth edition of the AmericanPsychiatric Association'sDiagnostic and Statistical Manualdescribes several traits associatedwith narcissistic personality disorder.They include a grandiose view of oneself,problems with empathy,a sense of entitlement,and a need for admiration or attention.What makes these trait a truepersonality disorderis that they take over people's livesand cause significant problems.Imagine that instead of caringfor your spouse or children,you used them as a sourceof attention or admiration.Or imagine that instead of seekingconstructive feedback about your performance,you instead told everyone who tried to help youthat they were wrong.So what causes narcissism?Twin studies show a strong genetic component,although we don't know which genes are involved.But environment matters, too.Parents who put their childon a pedestalcan foster grandiose narcissism.And cold, controlling parentscan contribute to vulnerable narcissism.Narcissism also seems to be higherin cultures that value individualityand self-promotion.In the United States, for example,narcissism as a personality traithas been rising since the 1970s,when the communal focus of the 60sgave way to the self-esteem movementand a rise in materialism.More recently, social media has multipliedthe possibilities for self-promotion,though it's worth notingthat there's no clear evidencethat social media causes narcissism.Rather, it provides narcissists a meansto seek social status and attention.So can narcissists improve on those negative traits?Yes!Anything that promotes honest reflectionon their own behaviorand caring for others,like psychotherapy or practicing compassion towards others, can be helpful.The difficulty is it can be challengingfor people with narcissistic personality disorderto keep working at self-betterment.For a narcissist, self-reflection is hardfrom an unflattering angle.",

   "title": "A brie(f) history of cheese - Paul Kindstedt",
   "publishedAt": "13 Dec 2018",
   "transcription": "Before empires and royalty,before pottery and writing,before metal tools and weapons \u2013there was cheese.As early as 8000 BCE,the earliest Neolithic farmers living in the Fertile Crescentbegan a legacy of cheesemakingalmost as old as civilization itself.The rise of agriculture led to domesticated sheep and goats,which ancient farmers harvested for milk.But when left in warm conditions for several hours,that fresh milk began to sour.Its lactic acids caused proteins to coagulate, binding into soft clumps.Upon discovering this strange transformation,the farmers drained the remaining liquid \u2013later named whey \u2013and found the yellowish globs could be eaten fresh as a soft, spreadable meal.These clumps, or curds, became the building blocks of cheese,which would eventually be aged, pressed, ripened, and whizzedinto a diverse cornucopia of dairy delights.The discovery of cheese gave Neolithicpeople an enormous survival advantage.Milk was rich with essential proteins, fats, and minerals.But it also contained high quantities of lactose \u2013a sugar which is difficult to process for many ancient and modern stomachs.Cheese, however, could provide all of milk\u2019s advantages with much less lactose.And since it could be preserved and stockpiled,these essential nutrients could be eatenthroughout scarce famines and long winters.Some 7th millennium BCE pottery fragments found in Turkeystill contain telltale residues of the cheese and butter they held.By the end of the Bronze Age,cheese was a standard commodity in maritime tradethroughout the eastern Mediterranean.In the densely populated city-states of Mesopotamia,cheese became a staple of culinary and religious life.Some of the earliest known writingincludes administrative records of cheese quotas,listing a variety of cheeses for differentrituals and populationsacross Mesopotamia.Records from nearby civilizations in Turkey also reference rennet.This animal byproduct, produced in thestomachs of certain mammals,can accelerate and control coagulation.Eventually this sophisticated cheesemakingtool spread around the globe,giving way to a wide variety of new, harder cheeses.And though some conservative food cultures rejected the dairy delicacy,many more embraced cheese, and quicklyadded their own local flavors.Nomadic Mongolians used yaks\u2019 milk tocreate hard, sundried wedges of Byaslag.Egyptians enjoyed goats\u2019 milk cottage cheese, straining the whey with reed mats.In South Asia, milk was coagulated with avariety of food acids,such as lemon juice, vinegar, or yogurtand then hung to dry into loafs of paneer.This soft mild cheese could be added to curries and sauces,or simply fried as a quick vegetarian dish.The Greeks produced bricks of salty brinedfeta cheese,alongside a harder variety similar to today\u2019s pecorino romano.This grating cheese was produced in Sicilyand used in dishes all across the Mediterranean.Under Roman rule, \u201cdry cheese\u201d or \u201ccaseus aridus,\u201dbecame an essential rationfor the nearly 500,000 soldiers guardingthe vast borders of the Roman Empire.And when the Western Roman Empire collapsed,cheesemaking continued to evolvein the manors that dotted the medievalEuropean countryside.In the hundreds of Benedictine monasteriesscattered across Europe,medieval monks experimented endlessly with different types of milk,cheesemaking practices,and aging processes that led to many of today\u2019s popular cheeses.Parmesan, Roquefort, Munster and several Swiss typeswere all refined and perfected by these cheesemaking clergymen.In the Alps, Swiss cheesemaking wasparticularly successful \u2013producing a myriad of cow\u2019s milk cheeses.By the end of the 14th century,Alpine cheese from the Gruyere region ofSwitzerland had become so profitablethat a neighboring state invaded the Gruyere highlandsto take control of the growing cheese trade.Cheese remained popular through the Renaissance,and the Industrial Revolution took production out of the monasteryand into machinery.Today, the world produces roughly 22 billion kilograms of cheese a year,shipped and consumed around the globe.But 10,000 years after its invention,local farms are still following in the footsteps of their Neolithic ancestors,hand crafting one of humanity\u2019s oldest and favorite foods.",

   "transcription": "Depression is the leading causeof disability in the world.In the United States,close to 10% of adults struggle with depression.But because it's a mental illness,it can be a lot harder to understandthan, say, high cholesterol.One major source of confusion isthe difference between having depressionand just feeling depressed.Almost everyone feels downfrom time to time.Getting a bad grade,losing a job,having an argument,even a rainy day can bring onfeelings of sadness.Sometimes there's no trigger at all.It just pops up out of the blue.Then circumstances change,and those sad feelings disappear.Clinical depression is different.It's a medical disorder,and it won't go away just because you want it to.It lingers for at least two consecutive weeks,and significantly interferes with one's ability to work,play,or love.Depression can have a lotof different symptoms:a low mood,loss of interest in thingsyou'd normally enjoy,changes in appetite,feeling worthless or excessively guilty,sleeping either too much or too little,poor concentration,restlessness or slowness,loss of energy,or recurrent thoughts of suicide.If you have at least fiveof those symptoms,according to psychiatric guidelines,you qualify for a diagnosis of depression.And it's not just behavioral symptoms.Depression has physical manifestationsinside the brain.First of all,there are changes that could be seenwith the naked eyeand X-ray vision.These include smaller frontal lobesand hippocampal volumes.On a more microscale,depression is associated with a few things:the abnormal transmission or depletionof certain neurotransmitters,especially serotonin, norepinephrine,and dopamine,blunted circadian rhythms,or specific changes in the REMand slow-wave parts of your sleep cycle,and hormone abnormalities,such as high cortisol and deregulationof thyroid hormones.But neuroscientists still don't havea complete pictureof what causes depression.It seems to have to do with a complexinteraction between genes and environment,but we don't have a diagnostic toolthat can accurately predict whereor when it will show up.And because depression symptomsare intangible,it's hard to know who might look finebut is actually struggling.According to the National Instituteof Mental Health,it takes the average personsuffering with a mental illnessover ten years to ask for help.But there are very effective treatments.Medications and therapy complementeach other to boost brain chemicals.In extreme cases,electroconvulsive therapy,which is like a controlled seizurein the patient's brain,is also very helpful.Other promising treatments,like transcranial magnetic stimulation,are being investigated, too.So, if you know someone struggling with depression,encourage them, gently, to seek outsome of these options.You might even offer to helpwith specific tasks,like looking up therapists in the area,or making a list of questionsto ask a doctor.To someone with depression,these first steps can seem insurmountable.If they feel guilty or ashamed,point out that depression is a medical condition,just like asthma or diabetes.It's not a weakness or a personality trait,and they shouldn't expect themselvesto just get over itanymore than they could will themselvesto get over a broken arm.If you haven't experienced depression yourself,avoid comparing it to timesyou've felt down.Comparing what they're experiencingto normal, temporary feelings of sadnesscan make them feel guilty for struggling.Even just talking about depression openly can help.For example, research shows that askingsomeone about suicidal thoughtsactually reduces their suicide risk.Open conversations about mental illnesshelp erode stigmaand make it easier for people to ask for help.And the more patients seek treatment,the more scientists will learnabout depression,and the better the treatments will get.",

   "title": "How did Hitler rise to power? - Alex Gendler and Anthony Hazard",
   "publishedAt": "18 Jul 2016",
   "transcription": "How did Adolf Hitler,a tyrant who orchestrated one of thelargest genocides in human history,rise to power in a democratic country?The story begins at the endof World War I.With the successful Allied advance in 1918,Germany realized the war was unwinnableand signed an armistice ending the fighting.As its imperial government collapsed,civil unrest and worker strikesspread across the nation.Fearing a Communist revolution,major parties joined to suppress the uprisings,establishing the parliamentaryWeimar Republic.One of the new government's first taskswas implementing the peace treatyimposed by the Allies.In addition to losing over a tenthof its territory and dismantling its army,Germany had to accept full responsibilityfor the war and pay reparations,debilitating its already weakened economy.All this was seen as a humiliationby many nationalists and veterans.They wrongly believed the war could have been wonif the army hadn't been betrayedby politicians and protesters.For Hitler, these views became obsession,and his bigotry and paranoid delusionsled him to pin the blame on Jews.His words found resonance in a societywith many anti-Semitic people.By this time, hundreds of thousands of Jewshad integrated into German society,but many Germans continued to perceivethem as outsiders.After World War I, Jewish success ledto ungrounded accusationsof subversion and war profiteering.It can not be stressed enough that theseconspiracy theorieswere born out of fear,anger,and bigotry,not fact.Nonetheless, Hitler found success with them.When he joined a small nationalistpolitical party,his manipulative public speakinglaunched him into its leadershipand drew increasingly larger crowds.Combining anti-Semitism with populist resentment,the Nazis denounced both Communismand Capitalismas international Jewish conspiraciesto destroy Germany.The Nazi party was not initially popular.After they made an unsuccessful attemptat overthrowing the government,the party was banned,and Hitler jailed for treason.But upon his release about a year later,he immediately began to rebuildthe movement.And then, in 1929, the Great Depression happened.It led to American banks withdrawingtheir loans from Germany,and the already struggling German economycollapsed overnight.Hitler took advantage of the people's anger,offering them convenient scapegoatsand a promise to restore Germany'sformer greatness.Mainstream parties provedunable to handle the crisiswhile left-wing opposition was toofragmented by internal squabbles.And so some of the frustrated publicflocked to the Nazis,increasing their parliamentary votes fromunder 3% to over 18% in just two years.In 1932, Hitler ran for president,losing the election to decorated war heroGeneral von Hindenburg.But with 36% of the vote, Hitler haddemonstrated the extent of his support.The following year, advisors and business leadersconvinced Hindenburg to appoint Hitleras Chancellor,hoping to channel his popularityfor their own goals.Though the Chancellor was onlythe administrative head of parliament,Hitler steadily expanded the powerof his position.While his supporters formed paramilitary groupsand fought protestors in streets.Hitler raised fears of a Communist uprisingand argued that only he could restorelaw and order.Then in 1933,a young worker was convicted ofsetting fire to the parliament building.Hitler used the event to convincethe governmentto grant him emergency powers.Within a matter of months,freedom of the press was abolished,other parties were disbanded,and anti-Jewish laws were passed.Many of Hitler's early radical supporterswere arrested and executed,along with potential rivals,and when President Hindenburg diedin August 1934,it was clear there would be no new election.Disturbingly, many of Hitler's early measures didn't require mass repression.His speeches exploited people's fear and ireto drive their support behind himand the Nazi party.Meanwhile, businessmen and intellectuals,wanting to be on the right side of public opinion,endorsed Hitler.They assured themselves and each otherthat his more extreme rhetoric was only for show.Decades later, Hitler's rise remains a warningof how fragile democratic institutionscan be in the face of angry crowdsand a leader willing to feed their angerand exploit their fears.",

   "title": "What makes something \"Kafkaesque\"? - Noah Tavlin",
   "publishedAt": "20 Jun 2016",
   "transcription": "\"Someone must have been tellinglies about Josef K.He knew he had done nothing wrong,but one morning, he was arrested.\"Thus begins \"The Trial,\"one of author Franz Kafka'smost well-known novels.K, the protagonist, is arrested out of nowhereand made to go througha bewildering processwhere neither the cause of his arrest,nor the nature of the judicial proceedingsare made clear to him.This sort of scenario is consideredso characteristic of Kafka's workthat scholars came up with a new word for it.Kafkaesque has entered the vernacularto describe unnecessarily complicatedand frustrating experiences,like being forced to navigate labyrinthsof bureaucracy.But does standing in a long lineto fill out confusing paperworkreally capture the richness of Kafka's vision?Beyond the word's casual use,what makes something Kafkaesque?Franz Kafka's stories do indeed dealwith many mundane and absurd aspectsof modern bureaucracy,drawn in part from his experienceof working as an insurance clerkin early 20th century Prague.Many of his protagonists are office workerscompelled to struggle througha web of obstaclesin order to achieve their goals,and often the whole ordeal turns outto be so disorienting and illogicalthat success becomes pointlessin the first place.For example, in the short story, \"Poseidon,\"the Ancient Greek god is an executiveso swamped with paperworkthat he's never had time to explorehis underwater domain.The joke here is that not evena god can handle the amount of paperworkdemanded by the modern workplace.But the reason why is telling.He's unwilling to delegate any of the workbecause he deems everyone else unworthy of the task.Kafka's Poseidon is a prisonerof his own ego.This simple story contains all of the elementsthat make for a truly Kafkaesque scenario.It's not the absurdity of bureaucracy alone,but the irony of the character's circular reasoning in reaction to itthat is emblematic of Kafka's writing.His tragicomic stories act as a form ofmythology for the modern industrial age,employing dream logic to explorethe relationshipsbetween systems of arbitrary powerand the individuals caught up in them.Take, for example, Kafka's most famous story, \"Metamorphosis.\"When Gregor Samsa awaken's one morningto find himself transformedinto a giant insect,his greatest worry is that he gets to work on time.Of course, this proves impossible.It was not only the authoritarian realmof the workplace that inspired Kafka.Some of his protagonists' strugglescome from within.The short story, \"A Hunger Artist,\"describes a circus performer whose actconsists of extended fasts.He's upset that the circus masterlimits these to 40 days,believing this prevents him from achievinggreatness in his art.But when his act loses popularity,he is left free to starve himself to death.The twist comes when he lays dyingin anonymity,regretfully admitting that his arthas always been a fraud.He fasted not through strength of will,but simply because he never founda food he liked.Even in \"The Trial,\"which seems to focus directly on bureaucracy,the vague laws and bewildering procedurespoint to something far more sinister:the terrible momentum of the legal systemproves unstoppable,even by supposedly powerful officials.This is a system that doesn't serve justice,but whose sole function is to perpetuate itself.What political theorist Hannah Arendt,writing years after Kafka's death,would call \"tyranny without a tyrant.\"Yet accompanying the bleakness of Kafka's stories,there's a great deal of humorrooted in the nonsensical logicof the situations described.So on the one hand, it's easy to recognizethe Kafkaesque in today's world.We rely on increasingly convoluted systemsof administrationthat have real consequences onevery aspect of our lives.And we find our every word judgedby people we can't seeaccording to rules we don't know.On the other hand, by fine-tuningour attention to the absurd,Kafka also reflects our shortcomingsback at ourselves.In doing so, he reminds us that the worldwe live in is one we create,and have the power to change for the better.",
